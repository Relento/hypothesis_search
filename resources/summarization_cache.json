{"('[{\\'role\\': \\'system\\', \\'content\\': \\'You are a genius solving language puzzles.\\'}, {\\'role\\': \\'user\\', \\'content\\': \\'Given a list of rules, categorize them into eight distinct categories based on their similarities. For each category, synthesize the rules into a single, specific rule that combines the ideas of all rules in that category, while clearly differentiating it from the other categories.\\\\nThe new rule should be as specific as possible, following the format of the given rules.\\\\nThe new rule should be applicable without any information from the original rules - i.e. it should be standalone.\\\\n\\\\nRules:\\\\n1. To make the output, imagine the input grid separated into 9 blocks, each block being a 3x3 grid. Fill in each corresponding block of the output grid with the pattern from the input grid. For example, if the upper left block of the input grid is all orange, then fill the upper left block of the output grid with all orange.\\\\n2. To make the output, you have to amplify the input grid. Every 1x1 cell on the input grid must be transformed into a 3x3 cell on the output grid. Each cell of this 3x3 cell is the same as the corresponding 1x1 cell on the input grid. The 3x3 cells on the output grid are to be created from the top left to the bottom right, line by line. On each line, the cells get created from left to right.\\\\n3. The transformation deals with converting each cell of the 3x3 input grid into a miniature 3x3 grid in the output. In each 3x3 output grid, the center is replaced with the corresponding cell from the input grid while the rest eight cells are reflective copies of that same input cell except diagonally. For example, the top left cell in the input becomes the 3x3 grid in top left of the output. The center cell of this 3x3 grid is same as top left input cell while rest of the cells are identical copies except the diagonal ones (top right, bottom left, bottom right, top left) which are replaced with black color. Repeat this for every cells of the input grid to form the complete output grid.\\\\n4. To make the output, you have to scale the input grid up by 3x, filling each 3x3 output grid square with the corresponding color from the input. A 3x3 output grid square corresponds to a single cell in the input grid, copying its color value to all cells within that 3x3 output grid square. For example, if a cell in the input grid has a color of \\\\\\'2\\\\\\', then the corresponding 3x3 square in the output grid will have all cells filled with color \\\\\\'2\\\\\\'.\\\\n5. To make the output, you have to scale the input grid to a larger size. The original 3x3 grid is represented in the middle of the output grid. The first and third row and column of the output grid duplicate the first and third row and column of the input. The other cells in the output grid are filled with black cells.\\\\n6. To make the output, you have to repeat the 3x3 grid to place it in each quarter of the output grid, but adding originating grid in the central part of each repeated grid. In other words, imagine the input grid is being repeated four times, once in each quarter of the output grid. In each of these repeated grids, the original input grid is added to the center.\\\\n7. To make the output, you have to upscale the pattern to 3 times its original size by duplicating the pattern horizontally and vertically. This results in the original pattern repeating three times each way. Then, superimpose the original 3x3 grid at the top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right corners of the grid.\\\\n8. To produce the output, you have to expand the 3x3 square in the input into a 9x9 square. The grid is divided into 9 3x3 squares, and for each square, the boxes are filled in the pattern of the input grid. The top left 3x3 square is filled with the original pattern, the middle with the pattern, rotated once (90 degrees clockwise), the top right with the pattern, rotated twice (180 degrees), the center left with pattern rotated 3 times (270 degrees), the center with original pattern, the center right with pattern rotated once, the bottom left with the pattern rotated twice, the center bottom with the pattern rotated three times, and the bottom right with the original pattern again.\\\\n9. To create the output, start by rotating the input grid 90 degrees clockwise and place the result in the top left corner of the output grid. Then, flip the input grid horizontally and put it in the top middle portion of the output grid. After that, rotate the input grid 180 degrees and put it in the top right portion of the output grid. Repeat this action for the middle and bottom rows of the output grid but for the middle row, make the middle portion all black cells. For the bottom row, rotate the input grid 180 degrees for the left and right portions and flip it horizontally for the middle portion.\\\\n10. To make the output, you have to expand each cell from the input into a 3x3 grid on the output. The original cell from the input is duplicated into the corresponding positions in the output. For example, the middle cell (row 2, column 2) of the input is transformed into the 3x3 grid in the middle of the output (rows 4-6, columns 4-6). This is repeated for each cell in the input.\\\\n11. To make the output, you should image the input grid with an additional margin from all sides, where black boxes. Extend the size of the grid to a 9x9 by repeating the 3x3 input grid three times vertically and horizontally. The diagonal boxes from the top left to the bottom right side of the 9x9 grid should be replaced by the 3x3 grid given in input to form a kind of diagonal mirror effect. The resulting structure should form a diamond shape of the original 3x3 grid on the 9x9 output grid.\\\\n12. To make the output, repeat each row of the input three times horizontally and then each column is repeated three times vertically. For instance, if the leftmost column of the input is [0, 7, 0], then the three leftmost columns of the output will be [[0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 7], [0, 0, 0]]. The grid expansion is done in such a manner that values from the input grid are separated by two spaces in the output grid. The original 3x3 grid appears in the top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right quadrants of the expanded 9x9 grid.\\\\n13. The output can be seen as 3x3 copies of the input grid. The first thing you have to do is copy the whole input grid into the first quarter of the output (top-left 3x3 section of the output). Do the same but mirror the input horizontally in the top-right 3x3 section of the output. Then, copy the whole input grid but mirror it vertically in the bottom-left 3x3 section of the output. Finally, Place the input grid mirrored both horizontally and vertically in the bottom-right section of 3x3 in the output.\\\\n14. The transformation from input to output grid is that each cell in the 3x3 input grid is replicated to a corresponding 3x3 block in the output grid, preserving the position of the colored cells. The position of the color cells in the 3x3 block are directly related to their position in 3x3 input grid and the overall 9x9 grid. For instance, the bottom-left cell in the 3x3 input grid becomes the 3x3 block in the bottom-left of the 9x9 output grid. Likewise, the top-left cell in the 3x3 input grid becomes the 3x3 block in the top-left of the 9x9 output grid and so forth for the other cells in the grid.\\\\n15. Expand the given 3x3 grid into a 9x9 grid by dividing each cell into a smaller 3x3 grid and filling the cells as follows:  - If the original cell is on an edge (not the centre), replicate the cell value to the centre of the smaller 3x3 grid, otherwise fill with 0. - If the original cell is in the centre, fill the entire smaller 3x3 grid with the cell value. - If the original cell is at any corner, replicate the cell value to the corner cells in the smaller 3x3 grid of the corresponding corner, otherwise fill with 0.\\\\n16. To make the output, you have to replicate and scale up the input grid. Each cell of the input grid should be expanded to a 3x3 sub-grid in the output. The cells in each 3x3 sub-grid should be filled according to the corresponding cell in the input. If the cell in the input grid is colored, the corners and the center of the sub-grid are colored. If the cell in the input grid is black, then all cells in the sub-grid are black.\\\\n17. The transformation involves creating a scaled-up version of the 3x3 input grid. Each cell (both colored and empty) of the input grid is represented as a 3x3 block in the output grid. Here\\\\\\'s how it works:  1. Divide the output grid into nine 3x3 blocks. 2. For each cell in the input, the corresponding block in the output is completely filled if the cell is colored. For example, if the top-left cell in the input grid contains a color, the entire top-left 3x3 block of the output grid will be filled with that color. 3. If the cell in the input grid is empty, only the center square of the corresponding 3x3 block in the output grid is filled, following the same color from the input. The rest squares of the block are left empty. For example, if the middle cell in the input grid is empty, only the center square of the middle 3x3 block of the output grid will be filled. 4. This rule is applied to all cells of the input grid, creating a scaled-up pattern in the output grid.\\\\n18. The transformation involves creating an expanding effect. Imagine that each non-black cell in the input grid is replaced by a 3x3 square of the same color in the output grid. These color squares copy the layout of the input grid three times on the diagonal starting from left top to bottom right. The rest of the cells in the output grid are black or empty.\\\\n19. To make the output, you have to create a duplicate of the input grid in each quadrant of the 9x9 output grid. This means that the 3x3 grid is scaled up into a 9x9 grid where each cell in the 3x3 grid is now a 3x3 section in the 9x9 grid with the same color/content.\\\\n20. To make the output, replicate each cell of the input grid into a 3x3 block on the output grid. Each cell in the input grid becomes a 3x3 square of the same color on the output grid. So, you can imagine this as if you are magnifying the input grid by 3 times.\\\\n21. To make the output, you have to expand the input grid to a 9x9 grid following the 3x3 pattern by replicating the rows three times and repeating the input pattern three times horizontally. Each row of the 3x3 grid will expand to 3 identical rows in the 9x9 grid, and each column of the 3x3 grid will expand to 3 identical columns in the 9x9 grid.\\\\n22. To make the output, you have to copy the input grid 3x3 times into the output grid with the same pattern. The output grid consists of 9 smaller grids (3x3 arrangement), each identical to the input grid. Starting from the top left corner, copy the first row of the input grid into the first, second and third row of the first smaller grid in the top row of the output grid, then continue for the rest. For the second and third smaller grid in the top row, copy the second and third row of the input grid. Repeat this process for the second and third row of smaller grids in the output grid. Thus, the output consists of triple-sized rows and columns compared to the input, with the content in groups of three rows and columns being identical to the respective content in the input grid.\\\\n23. To make the output, you have to scale the input grid 3 times in both the horizontal and vertical directions. In this process, each element of the input grid will take up a 3x3 block in the output grid. In each 3x3 block corresponding to a non-zero element, there will be a 2x2 square filled with that number in the bottom right corner, and all other cells in that block will be filled with 0. In the 3x3 block corresponding to a zero element in the input grid, all cells will be filled with 0.\\\\n24. To make the output, you have to replicate the input grid 3 times both horizontally and vertically. The first horizontal set copies the original input, the second set flips the original input horizontally, and the third set leaves the boxes empty. Repeat this pattern vertically to complete the grid.\\\\n25. For each row in the input, you have to replicate that row 3 times in the output. For each cell in the input, you have to copy the value to a 3x3 square in the output. In this way, you will be essentially upscaling the input from a 3x3 to a 9x9 grid.\\\\n26. To make the output, the input grid is enlarged to a 9x9 grid in which the original single cells are replaced with a 3x3 cluster corresponding to the position of that cell within the 3x3 grid. That is, a replicate of the input 3x3 grid is placed in an area corresponding to the position of each non-zero cell in the input grid. The cells in the grid of replicates are separated by black cells (0\\\\\\'s).\\\\n27. To transform your input into the output, picture the input grid as being divided into nine 3x3 grids. Now fill up each of these smaller grids in the output with the respective matching value from the input. For example, if the first cell in the input grid is a \"7\", the 3x3 grid at the same relative position in the output grid should be filled entirely with \"7\".\\\\n28. To make the output, you have to create a larger continue of the input Pattern, repeating it 3 times in both the rows and columns.   The top left 3x3 portion of the output is the input grid. The middle 3x3 portion of the output shares the same middle row and column with the input grid, but the top and bottom row, as well as the left and right column, are filled with black boxes. The bottom right 3x3 portion of the output is the input grid flipped across the diagonal(axis).\\\\n29. To make the output, you have to create a 9x9 grid which again divided into smaller 3x3 squares. Assign each of the 9 small squares the pattern from the input grid in the following way:  - The first small square (top left) is assigned the pattern of the first column of the input grid. - The second small square (top middle) is assigned the pattern of the first row of the input grid - The third small square (top right) is assigned the pattern of the first column of the input grid - The fourth small square (middle left) is assigned the pattern of the first row of the input grid.  - The fifth small square (central) is assigned the pattern of the second column of the input grid. - The sixth small square (middle right) is assigned the pattern of the first row of the input grid. - The seventh small square (bottom left) is assigned the pattern of the third column of the input grid. - The eighth small square (bottom middle) is assigned the pattern of the third row of the input grid. - The ninth small square (bottom right) is assigned the pattern of the third column of the input grid.   It\\\\\\'s\\\\n30. To make the output, you need to magnify the input grid by a factor of 3. Each cell in the input is represented by a 3x3 square in the output. The central square in the output corresponds to the cell in the same position in the input, while the outer squares mirror the values of the cells in the input that share their edges or corners with the original cell in the input grid. If there\\\\\\'s no such corresponding cell (it\\\\\\'s outside of the input grid), this square should be black (0).\\\\n31. To make the output, you should enlarge the input by multiplying its size by three, creating an expanded 9x9 grid. For each 3x3 square within this new 9x9 grid, copy the 3x3 pattern from the corresponding position of the input. Now, overlay a 3x3 black square in the center of the 9x9 grid, creating a black cross, while maintaining colors at the corners.\\\\n32. To make the output, you have to expand each cell in the input grid to a 3x3 cell in the output and then overlay the original grid pattern onto the enlarged grid. This will give the effect that the original grid has been scaled up by a factor of three while maintaining the original color patterning structure of the grid.\\\\n33. To make the output, each cell from the input is used to create a 3x3 block in the output. The position of the color in the 3x3 block corresponds to the position of the cell in the input 3x3 grid. The other cells in the 3x3 block are black.\\\\n34. The conversion can be achieved by enlarging the input grid by exactly 3 times, whose magnification of each element is reflected in its spreading along the diagonals. Specifically, the original 1x1 cell has become a 3x3 block in the output where the colored cell placement mirrors its location in the original 1x1 cell. Rest of the cells in the increased 3x3 block remain black.\\\\n35. The pattern involves replicating the input grid in a 3x3 pattern within the 9x9 grid. Specifically, the transformation is in the form of upscaling, where each cell in the input is enlarged to a 3x3 square in the output with the exact same color of the input cell. These squares are then placed in their corresponding positions in the transformed grid, adhering to the layout of the 3x3 input grid. This essentially gives you three copies of the original 3x3 pattern across both rows and columns, except that each 1x1 cell is now a 3x3 cell of the same color.\\\\n36. To make the output, you have to repeat each row and each column three times. This means each cell of the input grid is expanded into a 3x3 grid on its own, with the center being the original cell and the other cells having the same value as the corresponding cell in the 3x3 square built using its neighboring cells in the input grid. If there is no such neighboring cell, it is assumed to be a black cell.\\\\n37. To create the output, first, you need to divide the 9x9 grid into 9 smaller 3x3 grids. Then, you fill each smaller grid with the pattern from the input. The pattern for each smaller grid is located at the corresponding position in the input. For example, the top left 3x3 grid in the output should be filled with the pattern of the top left cell in the input, and so on.\\\\n38. To make the output, you have to scale the input grid up by 3, such that the cell value in input grid represents a 3x3 section in the output grid, and the value of middle cell in each 3x3 section in output grid is same as the respective cell value in the input grid. For other cells in each 3x3 section, if it\\\\\\'s in the same position as a non-zero cell in the input grid, then use the value of that cell in the input grid, otherwise, use black(0). So effectively, the input grid is zoomed in and repeated in a symmetric way around middle columns/rows in the output grid.\\\\n39. To make the output, each cell of the input grid should be enlarged from 1x1 to 3x3. This can be understood as each cell of the input being expanded into a 3x3 square of the same colour in the output grid. It creates a larger, scaled-up version of the original pattern.\\\\n40. To make the output, consider the input grid as a pattern of 3x3. This pattern is repeated 3 times from left-to-right and from top-to-bottom, thus scaling the original pattern 3 times bigger in both the column and the row.\\\\n41. To make the output, we have to duplicate the input grid in both the x and y axis. After that, each block of 3x3 cells of the output grid is replaced with the corresponding 1x1 cell from the input grid. So, the transformation consists of scaling up the input grid by a factor of 3, and repeating the original pattern in a grid-wise manner.\\\\n42. The transformation consists of expanding the original 3x3 grid into a 9x9 grid where each cell of the original grid is now a 3x3 grid in the output. If the cell in the input was black then the central cell in the corresponding 3x3 grid in the output is of the same color as the original cell with the rest being black. If the cell in the input is a color other than black then the top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right cells in the corresponding 3x3 grid in the output are of the same color as the original cell with the rest being black.\\\\n43. To make the output, you have to expand the input grid to 9x9 by repeating the pattern of the rows and columns in the input three times. Each cell in the input grid is replaced by a 3x3 grid with the same pattern of colors in the input cell\\\\\\'s row and column. The cell at the intersection of the row and column retains the original color. The rest of the cells in the 3x3 grid are black.\\\\n44. In order to transform the input into the output, each square in the 3x3 input grid should be expanded to a 3x3 grid in the output. For example, a colored square at the top right in the input would be transformed into a 3x3 colored square at the top right in the output. Similarly, a blank square in the center of the input would be transformed into a 3x3 blank square in the center of the output. The color and position of the squares should be maintained.\\\\n45. To create the output grid, enlarge the input grid 3 times the original size. Each cell in the input extends to a 3x3 area in the output. The color of the 3x3 area matches the color of the corresponding cell in the input. However, the cell at the center of each 3x3 block in the output should remain as it is in the input, and the color of the four corner cells in the 3x3 block should match the color of the cell located at the same corner relative to the center in the input. If the input grid\\\\\\'s cell for the corners is black, the corner cells in the 3x3 block in the output are also black. If the corner cells in the input are colored, the associated corner cells in the output are also colored. Hence, the cells are magnified 3 times, while the empty cells in the input grid remain empty in the output grid.\\\\n46. To make the output, you have to scale up the input by 3 times along both dimensions. Each single cell in the input now corresponds to a 3x3 block in the output. Specifically, the top-left cell in the input corresponds to the top-left 3x3 block in the output, the middle cell in the input corresponds to the middle 3x3 block in the output, and so on for all other cells.\\\\n47. To make the output, you have to create a larger grid by repeating and mirroring the input grid. Each cell of the input grid corresponds to a 3x3 block in the output. The original cell is placed in all four corners of the block. The center of the block is empty if the cell was black and colored if the cell was colored. The remaining four cells in the block are empty.\\\\n48. To make the output, you have to upscale the grid to three times of its original size. Imagine that you\\\\\\'re replicating the 3x3 grid but on a larger space of 9x9, where you repeat each row and column three times. Also note that every third column or row (starting from the first row/column) will be the replication of the first row or column of the input, and every third element in the larger 3x3 sections are copied from the diagonal of the original 3x3 grid.\\\\n49. To transform the grid, every cell in the input grid is expanded into a 3x3 square in the output grid with the same number as the original one in the middle cell and all the surrounding cells have the number 0 representing black except for the ones that directly correspond to the rows or columns to the original cell. That means the original numbers/values are preserved at the center and the positions corresponding to it, and other cells are turned into black.\\\\n50. To make the output, you need to amplify the 3x3 grid from the input into a 9x9 grid. Each cell in the input grid turns into a smaller 3x3 grid in the output. If the cell in the input grid is not blank (black), then the corresponding 3x3 grid in the output will have three filled (colored) cells in a horizontal line at the top, middle or bottom, depending on their original location in the input grid. If the cell in the input grid is black, the corresponding 3x3 grid in the output will have all black cells.\\\\n51. To make the output, you have to determine a 3x3 segment of the output grid based on corresponding input grid. Divide output grid into 3 horizontal and 3 vertical parts to form 3x3 segments. Now, the upper left box of the 3x3 input grid is replicated into the upper left 3x3 segment on the output grid, doing the same for the middle left box but applying that to the middle left 3x3 segment of the output grid, etc. This is done for all boxes of the 3x3 input grid to fill the output grid.\\\\n52. To make the output, you have to repeat each row of the input three times in the output and each column of the input three times in each of the repeating rows. This should create nine 3x3 copies of the original input grid in the output grid.\\\\n53. To fill the output grid, you have to mirror the 3x3 grid in both the x and y axis so that you\\\\\\'ve created a larger reflected pattern of the original 3x3 grid. The 3x3 grid is copied to all four corners of the 9x9 grid, and their transpose is put in between to complete the transformation.\\\\n54. To make the output, you have to expand each cell in the 3x3 input into a 3x3 grid itself in the output. The expanded 3x3 grid in the output will be composed of the same number (and therefore color) as in the original cell, except for positions that correspond to black cells in the input grid which will always remain black regardless of the number in the original cell. The overall 3x3 structure/order remains the same.\\\\n55. To make the output, divide the output grid into a 3x3 grid of 3x3 squares. For each corresponding square in the input and output:  - If the square in the input is coloured, fill in the entire 3x3 square in the output with the same colour. - If the square in the input is black, leave the 3x3 square in the output black.   Essentially, each square in the input grid is magnified 3 times in the output grid.\\\\n56. To make the output, you have to create a 9x9 grid where each cell of the input grid is represented as 3x3 grid in the output. The color of each of the nine cells in the output is the color of the corresponding cell in the input. This process is akin to an upscale by a factor of 3. The resulting output grid will essentially be an enlarged version of the input grid.\\\\n57. To make the output, you have to expand the original 3x3 grid into the 9x9 grid through replication. Replicate each cell in the original grid into 3x3 cells in the output grid. For example, the top left cell will be mapped to the top left 3x3 block in the output grid. This applies to all cells. It is like enlarging the original grid.\\\\n58. To make the output, divide the output grid into 9 equal squares. The color pattern in each of those squares should match the color pattern in the corresponding cell in the input grid. Specifically, the top left square of the output grid should match the color pattern in the top left cell of the input grid, and so on for all cells. For black cells in the input grid, the corresponding square in the output grid should also be filled with black.\\\\n59. To make the output, you have to repeat the input grid 3 times horizontally and 3 times vertically to form a 9x9 output grid. The repeating pattern goes from left to right and top to bottom. In this pattern every 3rd row and column in the output grid is replaced with all zeros, starting from the 4th row and 4th column.\\\\n60. To make the output, you have to duplicate each row and column of the input grid 3 times vertically and horizontally, respectively to create a 9x9 grid.

For each category, synthesize the rules into a single, specific rule that combines the ideas of all rules in that category, while clearly differentiating it from the other categories.\\\\nThe new rule should be as specific as possible, following the format of the given rules.\\\\nThe new rule should be applicable without any information from the original rules - i.e. it should be standalone.\\\\n\\\\nRules:\\\\n1. To create the output, the direction of the red and teal figures should be shifted.    For the red color represented by the number 2: Move all numbers representing the red color down until it intersects with the teal object.  For the teal color represented by the number 8: Move all numbers representing the teal color up to meet the red object.  If there are no intersecting parts between the red and teal objects, after the movement they should be positioned adjacent to each other. The sequence of objects (red on top and teal at bottom) should be maintained.   Blank spaces represented by the number 0 should be adjusted correspondingly to accommodate the object movements. The shape and size of objects should remain the same.\\\\n2. The transformation rule is to move number patterns from the top sections of the input grid to the middle sections of the output grid. If the pattern is at the very top of the input, it must be moved down five spaces in the output. If the pattern is less than five places from the top in the input, it should be centered in the output.\\\\n3. To make the output, you have to move all the colored shapes to the center of the grid, retaining their original order and position relative to each other. All the remaining cells in the grid are black.\\\\n4. To make the output, you have to mirror the input along the horizontal axis in the middle. Every pixel that is above this axis in the input should be placed below this axis in the output, and vice versa, without changing the left-right orientation. This flipping operation will move the rectangles that were in the upper part of the input to the lower part of the output and vice versa, keeping their shape and orientation unaltered.\\\\n5. The red and teal squares are moved upward by a certain number of rows to match the first non-black row in the grid. All other colors and black boxes remain in their original positions.\\\\n6. To make the output, you have to switch the positions of the red and teal shapes. The red shape is always moved to the position of the teal shape and vice versa. All the other cells remain the same, i.e., remain black.\\\\n7. To make the output, you have to center each group of colored shapes within the grid, meaning both colored shapes (red and teal) should appear in the middle of the grid, preserving their original structure. This operation involves translating the entire group of colored cells vertically until they are centered. Black cells remain unchanged.\\\\n8. The transformation involves moving the clusters of red and teal cells up or downwards towards the center of the grid. The teal cells move upwards until they reach the red cells, replacing any black cells they encounter. The red cells, on the other hand, move downwards until they reach the teal cells, replacing any black cells along the way. In case of a single cluster of either color, they move towards the center directly replacing any black cells they encounter. The movement stops when they encounter non-black cells or reach the center of the grid if no other colored clusters are present.\\\\n9. To make the output, you have to shift all the colored elements down by 5 cells. If there is a colored cell that\\'s outside the grid after the shift, it disappears. If a cell below the colored cells is empty (black), they slide down and fill this space. This transformation applies to red and teal colored cells. All the originally black cells remain black in the output grid.\\\\n10. To make the output grid, you have to move each red square 5 rows below its initial position and each teal square 5 rows above its initial position. If there are no spaces below or above the colored squares, then they remain at their original position. All the other cells (the empty ones) remain black.\\\\n11. The transformation involves shifting the colored shapes closer to the center of the grid while maintaining the exact relative arrangement of the shapes elements. The shifting is done along the row (horizontal axis), to draw them towards the middle column of the grid, while ensuring that they always remain fully within the grid boundaries and never overlap.   For example, if  a red shape is on the far left of the grid, it will be moved right so that its farthest left cell aligns with the middle column of the grid. Conversely, if a teal shape is on the far right of the grid, it should be shifted left so that its farthest right cell aligns with the grid\\'s middle column. Any cells which do not form part of the moved shapes remain black / uncolored.\\\\n12. To make the output, you have to flip each colored shape along horizontal axis. For example, a red shape appear in the middle of grid in the INPUT has to be moved to the middle-bottom in the OUTPUT. This would be equivalent to flipping the grid up side down but with each figure individually. The transformation leaves the black cells untouched.\\\\n13. To transform the input into the output, you have to replace positions of the red and teal square formations. Specifically, if there is a red square formation in the top half and a teal square formation in the bottom half, you should move the red formation to the same place in the bottom half and the teal formation to the same place in the top half. If the red or teal square formations are not in the top or bottom half, they remain the same. The black squares should remain in place.\\\\n14. To make the output, you need to move the red and teal squares to the middle of the grid. All other elements remain the same as the input. Each square maintains its original orientation while being shifted towards the center of the grid.\\\\n15. To make the output, you should keep the relative positions of the shapes the same but move them to the center of the grid. Don\\'t move them along the diagonal but instead, keep any Y-coordinates movement the same as the X-coordinates. Keep the positioning of individual colors within each shape the same.\\\\n16. To make the output, you need to simply shift the mirror image shapes closer by moving them towards the center of the grid while maintaining their shapes and colors. If there are black rows between the shapes, they should also be shifted accordingly. Once the shapes are moved, the empty spaces they previously occupied should be filled with black cells.\\\\n17. The red square/s and blue square from the input grid move down until they meet another color or reach the end of the grid. If the red square/s meet another color, they stop moving while the current color continues to move down. If the blue square meets a color, it stops moving and the other color continues to move down until reaching the end of the grid or meeting another color. If no color is met, the squares stop until they reach the end of the grid. The movement process goes on until all colors have stopped moving.\\\\n18. To transform the input grid to the output grid, lower the red shape so it aligns with the teal shape\\'s vertical position while keeping their horizontal positions intact. It\\'s as if the red shape is dropping down to the level of the teal shape. If there is no red shape, just keep the original grid.\\\\n19. To make the output, you have to move the shapes at lower parts of the grid and put them immediately below the upper shape/grid. The distance between the two shapes/grids should remain the same. The space below the lower shape/grid should be filled with zero (black).\\\\n20. To transform the input into the output, you should move the top shape down directly below the bottom shape. The rest of the grid should remain as black empty cells.\\\\n21. To make the output, you have to shift the color forms if they are present in the upper half of the grid to the lower half, maintaining the same position they took in the upper half alignment. Similarly, if the color forms are present in the lower half of the grid, they should be shifted upwards maintaining their original structure. The rest of the grid stays black.\\\\n22. To make the output, you have to first retain the teal shape in its original position on the grid. Then move the red shape to the center of the grid while maintaining its orientation. The remaining empty spaces on the grid should be filled with black color.\\\\n23. To make the output, you have to vertically shift the red square to be directly above the teal square, with at least one black row separating them. If there is not enough space to move the red square, the teal square should be shifted downwards instead. The black region remains unchanged.\\\\n24. To make the output, you have to shift the quarter in the second row to be below the quarter in the first row without changing their positions. In the same way, the quarter in the third row should be shifted to be below the quarter in the second row. All the cells that get emptied during this operation should be filled with black cells.\\\\n25. The transformation rule is to shift all blocks of red squares down such that the bottom row of the blocks aligns with the bottom row of the teal block(s) above it. Any blocks that are already on the bottom (such as the teal block) remain stationary.\\\\n26. To make the output, you have to move the cells of the colored objects (cross and square) to the middle of the grid. That is, retain the shape and color, but align their centers to the center of the grid.\\\\n27. To obtain the output from the input, the sequence of red and teal elements should be reordered such that the shapes made of the teal cells appear first (in the upper part of the grid),and the shapes made of the red cells appear last (in the lower part of the grid). The positioning of the cells inside each shape and the ordering of the shapes with respect to each other remains the same.\\\\n28. To make the output, you first keep the black cells the same. If there is teal shape in the grid, move it upwards in the grid until the top of the shape aligns with the middle row of the grid (considering zero based index). If there is red shape in the grid, move it downwards in the grid until the bottom of the shape aligns with the middle row of the grid. After moving, black cells are used to fill spaces that were previously occupied by these shapes.\\\\n29. The transformation appears to shift the location of the colored shapes downward until they hit the middle of the grid. The shapes seem to maintain their original arrangement, but their position in the grid changes. The rest of the grid remains black. In other words, the transformation takes the colored shapes, if any, and moves them downward, stopping at the middle. If there are two different colored shapes, first the top one moves down, followed by the bottom one.\\\\n30. The transformation involves moving the clusters of color to the center of the grid while keeping the relative positions of the colored squares within each cluster. A cluster should stay intact during this movement. It is like taking the clusters of color and sliding them towards the center of the grid until they are centered. The rest of the grid should remain black.\\\\n31. To make the output, you have to shift every row of the input vertically towards the center of the grid. The center is identified by the row containing teal cells. The transformation does not change the color or size of these figures nor the grid itself, it only shifts their positions closer to the middle.\\\\n32. To make the output grid, you have to move the upper colored grid down to the center, placing it below the lower colored grid. The upper colored grid should be roughly in the center of the total grid. The lower colored grid stays in place. All the other cells remain black.\\\\n33. To make the output, move the red shape down so that it is located in the center of the grid, just above the teal shape. Leave the teal shape as it is. All other cells should remain black.\\\\n34. To make the output, you have to shift the red shape downwards to the position of the teal shape while maintaining the position of the teal shape. The relative position of shapes to each other has to be preserved. The black spaces in the grid remain the same.\\\\n35. To make the output, you have to  move the geometrical images halfway down.\\\\n36. To transform the grid, first locate the positions of the colored rectangular shapes in the input grid. Then shift or translate these shapes vertically downwards such that the bottom part of each shape aligns with the center vertical line of the grid. The remaining cells should be filled with black. Note: If there are two shapes in the input grid, maintain their relative position while shifting them downwards.\\\\n37. To transform the grid to output, move only the red shape down three spaces. If it causes the red shape to overlap the teal shape, move the teal shape to underneath the red shape. All other cells remain black.\\\\n38. To make the output, you have to move any colored (red or teal) boxes closer to the center of the grid, maintaining their relative positions. The black background remains the same.\\\\n39. To make the output, you have to shift the red and teal squares to the center of the grid while keeping them in their respective half of the grid. The red square is moved to the center of the top half while the teal square is moved to the center of the bottom half. All other cells remain black.\\\\n40. To make the output, you have to move the colored objects vertically down in the grid. Shift all non-black cells down until they hit another non-black cell or the bottom border if they are surrounded only by black on the bottom side. Black cells above the moved colored objects will be replaced by black squares again.\\\\n41. To make the output, you have to shift the vertical colored block, red or teal, to the center of the grid while keeping their vertical position unchanged. If there are two colored blocks such as a red and a teal, shift both blocks to the center while keeping their original vertical positions. All other cells remain black.\\\\n42. To produce the output from the input, we move the shape made up of red cells down to be over the shape made up of teal cells. All empty space is filled with black cells, and any cells outside of the output grid size are ignored.\\\\n43. To make the output, you have to move any shapes or lines that lie in the upper half of the input grid to the lower half - keeping their relative positions and orientation. The empty space created in the upper half by moving these shapes/lines should be filled with black (0).   In simpler terms, the transformation works like pulling down a blind or curtain from the top half to the bottom half of the grid. Shapes that are in the top side of the input will slide down to the lower side of the output, while the top part gets filled up by the black color.\\\\n44. To make the output, you have to shift the red blocks and teal blocks each time to match positions. The red and teal blocks move downward until they reach the same row, with the red section always being above the teal section if they were originally at two different positions.\\\\n45. The transformation rules involve the vertical relocation of the specific colored figure (represented by the repeated numerical entity). If the figure is present at the top, it is shifted down by two cells, whereas if the figure is located in the middle, it is shifted up by three cells. The rest of the grid remains black.\\\\n46. To make the output, move all non-zero blocks up until the first block aligns with the center row of the grid.\\\\n47. To obtain the output from the input, swap the red and teal shapes by moving the teal shapes to where the red shapes are in the input and vice versa. Maintain the relative positions of shapes within their own color group (don\\'t swap red shapes with each other or teal shapes with each other). All other cells remain black.\\\\n48. To make the output, you have to move all colored symbols or shapes (red and teal) to the central part of the grid while retaining their respective positions relative to each other.\\\\n49. In order to transform the input grid into the output grid, shift the red square and teal square (keeping their structure intact) upwards, such that the red square is above the teal square with a space of black cells in between. The rest of the grid remains black cells.\\\\n50. To make the output, you have to shift the patterns vertically towards the center of the grid. If the patterns are closer to the top of the grid, they need to be shifted downwards, and the patterns closer to the bottom need to be shifted upwards. All the remaining cells should be filled with zeros.\\\\n51. To make the output, you have to shift the position of the two symbols. If the red symbol is above the teal symbol, move the red symbol down by a few steps so that it is on the same level as the teal symbol or vice-versa.\\\\n52. To make the output, you have to move the colored shapes to the center of the grid while keeping their relative positions. All the other cells remain the same.\\\\n53. To make the output, you have to move the colored blobs directly down until they hit a border or another colored blob. The blobs don\\'t change their shape or color, and black squares from the top replace where the blobs were initially. If there\\'s nothing to move in a given column, leave it as is.\\\\n54. To transform the input into the output, you need to move each colored row at the closest center of the grid. If there are two center rows, take the bottom one. Do nothing with the black cells.\\\\n55. The transform from input to output grid involves translating the red quadrant to occur below the teal quadrant without altering any other aspects of the grid.\\\\n56. To make the output, you have to move the red and teal shapes to the center of the grid. They have to be placed in the same order as they were before vertically, but this time they will be in the middle of the grid. All other squares remain black.\\\\n57. To make the output, you have to move the geometric shape formed by the red colour to the region previously occupied by the teal colour while keeping the shape and structure intact. Similarly, move the geometric shape formed by the teal colour to the region previously occupied by the red colour. The shapes basically swap their positions. The rest of the grid remains black (empty).\\\\n58. The transformation involves shifting the colored cells downwards until they touch the second group of colored cells. If there is no second group of colored cells, shift them to the bottom of the grid. Black cells fill the space that was previously occupied by the first group of colors.\\\\n59. To make the output, adjust the position of the shapes to the middle rows of the grid, while maintaining the distance between them as in the input. The irregular shapes should maintain their original orientation and color. All other cells remain empty (black).\\\\n60. To make the output, you have to slide the red square block upwards until its top edge aligns with the top edge of the teal square block. The teal square block remains unchanged, and the rest of the grid remains black.\\\\n61. To make the output, you have to perform a vertical translation of the clusters. Shift each cluster downwards while keeping their relative distance from the bottom of the grid constant. The cells moved out from the bottom reappear at the top. Every cell that does not belong to a cluster remains as it is.\\\\n62. To transform the grid, the first step is to identify the vertical center of the entire grid. Now, you need to check if there are any smaller squares of colored pixels (either red or teal) located above this center line. If there are, you keep these squares at the same position relative to the center line, but move them (including their surrounding black pixels) to the bottom half of the grid. If there were any smaller squares initially located in the bottom half, they should now be moved to the equivalent position in the top half, maintaining their position relative to the center line. Essentially, you\\'re flipping the squares, if they exist, across the center line of the grid.\\\\n63. To create the output grid, shift the blue cells down until they are at the same row as the teal ones. The teal cells will move directly upwards until they reach an empty cell. The rest of the grid remains black.\\\\n64. To make the output, you need to move the whole shape (either red or teal) closer to the center of the grid by removing the redundant rows and columns from the top and the left side of the shape. The remaining empty spaces should be filled with black boxes.\\\\n\"}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "Category 1: Shifting colored shapes towards the center of the grid\nRule: To make the output, shift all colored shapes (red and teal) towards the center of the grid while maintaining their relative positions and orientations.

For each category, synthesize the rules into a single, specific rule that combines the ideas of all rules in that category, while clearly differentiating it from the other categories.\\\\nThe new rule should be as specific as possible, following the format of the given rules.\\\\nThe new rule should be applicable without any information from the original rules - i.e. it should be standalone.\\\\n\\\\nRules:\\\\n1. To make the output, you have to remove all the black blocks in the grid and shift all the colored blocks downward. This makes the output grid identical to the input but without any black blocks.\\\\n2. Any occurrence of zeros amid the repeated sequence is replaced with the sequences original numbers, hence, erase all zeros from grid.\\\\n3. To make the output, remove any black lines that split sections in two in the input, and fill in the removed lines with the color pattern before the black line.\\\\n4. To make the output, you have to replace the cells of value 0 with the appropriate values to restore the original pattern. The pattern itself can be discerned by examining the lines of cells uninterrupted by cells of value 0.\\\\n5. To make the output, you have to replace the black cells placed in the cross shape in the center with the same pattern of colors that\\\\\\'s repeated in the rest of input grid. So, if the black cells in the middle of the grid were replaced with the pattern it can look like a continuous repetition of a pattern without any interruption.\\\\n6. 1. The first operation for transforming is to locate every instance of a black cell (0). Black cells are only found in the sections where a block of the pattern is missing.  2. In the spot of the black cells, the previous pair is repeated. This is observed on row 3, column 4 to 7, where the pattern returns to (3, 2) after the block of black cells.  3. Then find the pair that follows the section of black cells and repeat it for 3 cells, and then return to the previous pattern. This is observed on row 4, column 8 to 10, where the pattern continues with (6, 5) after the block of black cells.   So in summary, to transform the input to the output, one must replace all instances of a cell block filled with zeros with the repeating patterns of number pairs that occur both before and after these blocks.\\\\n7. To make the output, you have to remove all black cells (0) from the input grid. The black cells are replaced by the cell number that was there before the black cell in the corresponding row.\\\\n8. The output grid is obtained by eliminating the blocks of color 0 and returning the grid to the initial recurring pattern of 5 colored bands (in colors 3, 2, 6, 5, and 1 respectively) that repeats 4 times horizontally. This results in an exact copy of the original pattern, with no gaps or shifts.\\\\n9. To make the output, you have to replace all the black cells in the input grid with the cell pattern that comes immediately after these cells in each row. If the black cells are at the end of the row, replace them with the pattern that comes before these cells in the same row.\\\\n10. The transformation fills any black block by copying the nearest number from the left. If there is no number to the left, then the nearest number from the right is copied.\\\\n11. The transformation involves removing the black spaces in the input grid. When encountering a row that starts with a 0 (black), you copy the previous row\\\\\\'s pattern and fill the black spaces with this pattern to output the grid. If the row starts with a number other than 0, you directly copy it to the output. This rule is applied from top to bottom.\\\\n12. To make the output, look at the position of the black cells in the input. Any column or row that contains black cells should be copied without any black cells in the output. The black cells are considered disruptions and the output should not have these disruptions. So, remove all the black cells (0s) and fill these gaps by copying the pattern from the upper row or left column if the black cell occurs in a repeated pattern depending on its position.\\\\n13. To transform the input grid, you need to fill the black cells with the respective color sequence that continues from the rows above and below where the black cells are placed. This will maintain the uninterrupted color sequence pattern throughout the grid, hence restoring the original color pattern sequence.\\\\n14. To make the output, you have to fill the stripes of black cells with the pattern of numbers seen in the rest of the row they are in. This pattern should continue as if the black cells had not interrupted it. The pattern is a sequence of numbers that repeats every certain number of cells, starting with the first cell of each row.\\\\n15. To make the output, you have to remove the black cells from the input grid. The pattern of 3-2-3-6, 2-1-2-5 should remain intact and repeated in the same manner.\\\\n16. The transformation involves replacement of the black cells (represented by zero) with the color-coded numbers which follow the pattern of the grid. Specifically, the empty cells seem to be filled with the color-coded numbers that would be there if the pattern were uninterrupted.\\\\n17. To transform the grid, identify the spots where the pattern is broken, i.e., where we have the black squares. Fill in these black spots with the recurring pattern of \"green, orange, blue, teel\" such that it\\\\\\'s aligned with the existing pattern around it. You can consider that the black spots are obscuring the recurring sequence, and you\\\\\\'re just revealing it.\\\\n18. Our transformation involves erasing any sequence of zeros that interrupts a recurring number pattern. That is to say, wherever a sequence of zeros interrupts a recurring pattern of number sequences, the zeros are replaced to continue the recurring pattern.\\\\n19. To get the output grid, you need to fill in the black cells from the input grid with the colour of the nearest non-black cell on the left side of these black cells.\\\\n20. To make the output, you have to remove the sequences of black from the input which would result in the continuous patterns without any interruptions. All areas of the grid converted to black in the input should be filled with the pattern of colors as if the black never existed.\\\\n21. To make the output, you have to replace the black squares with the same pattern that directly follows. If there is no such pattern after a black section, follow the pattern of colored squares prior to it. If both before and after the black squares are different, the black squares would be replaced with the sequence before.\\\\n22. To make the output, you have to observe the input grid closely and you will take note of an alternating pattern of 3 unique numbers repeating vertically in the rows. A strip of 0\\\\\\'s in between these unique number patterns was replaced with the numbers. Hence, replace all the \\\\\\'0\\\\\\'s with repeating pattern of 3 numbers.\\\\n23. To make the output from the input grid, one has to replace all groups of four consecutive cells filled with the number 0 with the patterns they originally broke, following the sequence present before and after the group of 0. If a zero is at the border and does not correspond to a four-cell group, it remains as zero.  For instance, if 3 2 0 0 0 0 6 is detected in an input pattern, it would be transformed into 3 2 3 2 3 2 6 in the output. If the pattern is 3 0 2 3 6 in a particular row or column of the grid, it remains the same in the output as there is no four-cell group of 0s. The transformation applies both column-wise and row-wise.\\\\n24. To create the output, go through each cell of the input grid and, if the cell is blank (black), replace it with the color (number) which would have been there if the pattern had continued without interruption. Basically, the transformation fills the blank spaces in the repeating patterns.\\\\n25. To make the output, you need to remove all of the black cells from the input grid and restore the regular repeating pattern where the black cells were.\\\\n26. To make the output, you should completely remove the black regions seen in the input and sustain the rest of the grid as it was in the input. This in effect extends the repeating number sequences (in their original order) that are adjacent to the black regions to cover the former black regions as well.\\\\n27. To make the output, you have to replace all the black blocks to the original pattern seen at the first of the input grid.  The pattern is a two wide vertical strip that alternates between two colors, starting with green and purple at the top left corner.\\\\n28. To make the output, you have to scan the sequence of numbers on each row and replace the foursome of 0\\\\\\'s with the numbers in the sequence immediately before the 0\\\\\\'s. If a foursome of 0\\\\\\'s is at the beginning of a row, replace it with the repeating sequence on that row.\\\\n29. To make the output, essentially you need to remove all the black cells present in the input grid and fill it with the previous pattern or sequence that is present right before the black cells in each row. So, the sequence of each pattern will consist of no gaps or interruptions by the black cells in the output grid.\\\\n30. To make the output, replace all black cells with the numbers from the uninterrupted pattern of the original input line. The sequences are simply copied over, as though the blocks of black cells didn\\\\\\'t exist.\\\\n31. The transformation can be described as filling in the black cells with the color that corresponds to the pattern of the diagonal the cell is on. To clarify, if a black cell is found, fill it in with the color of the diagonal stripes it would be a part of, were it not black.\\\\n32. To make the output, you have to replace all the black cells with the numbers that would have otherwise fit with the pattern if there were no black cells. In each row, there\\\\\\'s a repeating pattern that\\\\\\'s split exactly by the black cells - the same numbers that come before the black cells should replace the black cells. The pattern continues uninterrupted by the black cells, as such, the numbers replacing the black cells cannot be randomly placed, instead, they have to fit in with the pattern, as though the black cells were invisible.\\\\n33. To make the output, you need to replace the black cells with the colors (numbers) in the exact same pattern that was before these black regions, i.e., replace the black cells with the pattern of alternating colors (numbers) keeping the sequence.\\\\n34. To make the output, you have to fill the black cells with the number they would have had if the sequence wasn\\\\\\'t interrupted. You continue the sequence along the row, not considering the breakages.\\\\n35. To make the output, you have to remove the horizontal lines of empty cells (black) seen in the input, by replacing them with the same pattern of colors as the rest of the grid. The pattern to be repeated is identified by the first row.\\\\n36. To make the output, you need to replace any instances of 0 with the number that should have been in its place if the original pattern had continued uninterrupted.\\\\n37. To make the output grid from the input, you need to overlook the 0 values and continue the pattern of repeating numbers that existed before them. The pattern to repeat seems to be horizontal and involves groups of 1 or multiple numbers. The pattern repeats following the rule of the last number before the zeros.\\\\n38. To make the output, you have to replace the black cells with the number that fits the pattern based on their position in the sequence. For example, if a black cell is at a position where the number 3 should have been in the sequence, replace it with 3.\\\\n39. To make the output, you have to take each row of the input grid. If the row contains black squares, replace them with numbers from the repeating pattern they disrupted, maintaining the sequence of the pattern.\\\\n40. To make the output, you have to replace each black box with the color of the box at the same position in a grid sequence that repeats every fourth row or column starting from the first row/column. If there\\\\\\'s no black box, other colored boxes remain the same. In other words, if i and j are the row and column of a cell, respectively, replace any black cell(i,j) in the grid with the cell (i%4,j%4) of the pattern.\\\\n41. In the process of transformation, the blocks separated by zeroes in the input grid are retained. However, where there is a back block in the input, the output copy of the number sequence from the block right before it. Basically, the transformation replaces the block of zeroes with a copy of the immediately preceding block in the input grid.\\\\n42. To make the output, you have to remove all black color in the input grid. The black color can be either in a form of stripe or square. Replacing the black cells with the color of the stripe they are in.\\\\n43. To create the output, remove the black rows from the input, preserving the sequence of the remaining colored periods.\\\\n44. To obtain the output grid from the input, we replace each instance of zeros that appear within the stripes with the sequence of numbers that forms the stripe, resulting in continuous stripes without interruptions.\\\\n45. To make the output, you have to fill the zeroes in the grid with the continuing pattern of colors from the left to right. If the zero is followed by a number before the end of the pattern sequence, then continue the pattern from that number.\\\\n46. To get the output grid from the input grid, remove all lines that are filled solely with black boxes.\\\\n47. To transform the grid, one should observe the columns without spaces (black cells). The pattern seen in those \"non-disrupted\" columns should be replicated to replace the spaces in the corresponding positions in the other columns. Thus the transformation involves essentially \"filling in\" the spaces (black cells) with the pattern present in the \"non-disrupted\" columns.\\\\n48. To form the output from the input, you need to replace all the black cells (or zeroes) in the matrix or grid with the first symbol (number 1 to 6) that comes before the black area, considering the cells row-wise from left to right. If not such symbol exists, that black area remains black.\\\\n49. To transform the grid into the output, replace all black color sections that form the rectangular or square shapes with a replica of the existing unique pattern taken from above the black section. This involves copying color blocks down into the respective black/empty space. The process is same throughout the entire input, complete by painting the whole grid with only four colors mentioned earlier.\\\\n50. To transform the input to the output, we will simply remove the zero\\\\\\'s where they were added and replace the original number that was supposed to be there before the zero was added. To do this, we look at the pattern in the same row outside the cube of zeros and extend it into the cube, replacing the zeros.\\\\n51. To make the output, you have to replace each 4x4 black cell block with a repeating pattern of the last two color cells that are seen above or to the left (excluding the black cells) of the top-left corner of the 4x4 black cell block. Essentially, the black cells are replaced and the other cells are copied directly.\\\\n52. To get the output grid from the input, remove all black colors in the input grid and bring the sequences together, eliminating the \\\\\\'gap\\\\\\'. From the new arrangement, check the row pattern and restore it to the original sequence pattern, thereby filling the \\\\\\'gap\\\\\\' in the input grid.\\\\n53. In order to get the output grid from the input, we need to eliminate any black cells and fill them with the number that is supposed to be in that place according to the sequence of numbers in each row. Each row seems to be following a particular pattern of numbers which we need to maintain while filling out the black cells.\\\\n54. The transformation pattern seems to involve replacing any black cells with the number that would have appeared in that spot, if the sequence had continued uninterrupted.\\\\n55. To obtain the output grid from the input grid, all the instances of black boxes, regardless of where they are in the grid, should be replaced by the colors they originally replaced and follow their original color patterns.\\\\n56. To make the output, you have to fill every row and column that are filled with 0s (representing blanks) with the pattern they were supposed to follow. You should disregard the transformation of the patterns from rows to columns or vice versa.\\\\n57. To make the output, you have to fill back the black cells with the color sequence of top and bottom sections, continuing the pattern in sequence where blocked. In other words, restore the repeating pattern where it was overwritten by black cells. If there is a black space in the middle of the pattern, replace it with the correct sequence of colors.\\\\n58. Fill the colors back based on the repeating pattern of colors present. Whenever there is a square painted black, replace the color based on the surrounding color. Note that the pattern is repeating periodically and each pattern period has a length of 3 (indicated by a cycle of three colors). Therefore, calculate the period of the current cell and fill the color according to the color corresponding to the period\\\\\\'s position.\\\\n59. To make the output, you have to identify the blank (black) sections in the input grid and replace them with the four-color sequence that matches their row; use the sequence that appears directly to their left as guidance. For example, if a row contains the sequence [3,2,3,6], blank sections in that row would be filled in with the same [3,2,3,6] sequence.\\\\n60. To transform the input grid into the output grid, replace every 0 in the input grid with the number that appears most frequently in the same row. If there\\\\\\'s a tie in frequency, choose the smaller number.\\\\n61. To make the output, you need to replace the black cells. The cells should be replaced according to the parity of the row number: if it\\\\\\'s even, replace the black cells with 3 (green); if it\\\\\\'s odd, replace them with 6 (orange). Note, the uppermost and leftmost row and column are considered 0.\\\\n62. To get the output, you need to replace the black lines or blank spaces with the pattern of highlighted stripes that appear right above it. In simple terms, you are filling in the blank patterns following the stripe pattern seen immediately above them.\\\\n63. To form the output grid, any occurrence of the large single-colored squares in the input should be replaced back with the original stripes pattern. This means the pattern of vertical stripes continues consistently across the grid, uninterrupted by the large squares.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "After analyzing the rules, they can be categorized into eight distinct categories based on their similarities.

To make the output, you need to divide the length of the input into equal thirds and take the middle third section. The height remains the same, so the entirety of the striped pattern remains.\\\\n4. To make the output, you have to disregard all vertical strips that are not green. Retain the green strips and compress the grid horizontally and vertically by summing up every 5 cells vertically and horizontally into a single cell in the output grid.\\\\n5. The transformation involves compressing each 3x3 square grids (above and below yellow strip) into a one single cell, which retains the color of the majority pixels. If the majority pixels are green then the color of the cell in the compressed grid is green. Yellow strip is reduced to a single line with color yellow. The order is preserved during compression.\\\\n6. The transformation involves reducing the size of the grid by excluding the orange rows and the red cells from the blue rows, essentially transforming into a smaller grid completely filled with blue cells.\\\\n7. To make the output, you have to divide the input grid into group of squares which size is 5x5. In every group keep the most frequent color block. If it has multiple most frequent blocks, the cell should take the color block which appears first in the sequence (0:black; 1:blue; 2:red; 3:green; 4:yellow; 5:grey; 6:fuschia; 7:orange; 8:teal; 9:brown). Fill all the cells in the group of squares by the color block selected in the previous step. Repeat the process for all the group of squares, then you will get the output grid.\\\\n8. To make the output, you have to count the number of rectangles marked by the different color in the input. Then, you should make an output box of the same color as the rectangles for each rectangle present in the input. So, the size of your output grid would depend on the number of rectangles found, and will be arranged in a square or rectangle shape. For instance, if you had 6 rectangles, your output grid would be 2x3 or 3x2.\\\\n9. To make the output, you have to compress the grid size by 4, taking a 4x4 block of cells from the original grid and if at least one cell is a color (not black), fill the corresponding cell in the output with that color. This method needs to be repeated using each 4x4 block in the input to create the corresponding cell in the output.\\\\n10. To make the output, you have to represent the input design/grid in a simplified form where all the repeated patterns blend into a uniform color, and the distinguishable colored line(s) is/are also represented proportionately by reducing the overall vertical size and maintaining the uniform color of the repeated pattern.\\\\n11. To make the output, you have to resize the input by factor of four in the vertical direction and by a factor of six in the horizontal direction, but keeping the dominantly seen color. Imagine that the input is being scaled down while preserving the main color in each divided section.\\\\n12. To make the output grid, you need to take each 3x3 window from the input and evaluate it. If the central cell of the 3x3 window is intersection of the green and orange line, return a green cell in the output grid. If not, return a black cell in the output grid. You should use a sliding window for each 3x3 part of the grid to determine the value of the output grid at the corresponding position.\\\\n13. To transform the input into the output, we need to remove the colored lines that are completely filled with one color and keep only the lines where the colors alternate. The result is a downscaled version of the original grid, keeping only the rows with color alternation.\\\\n14. For the transformation, start by looking at each 5x5 sub-grid in the input grid. If the majority of cells in the sub-grid are orange, then the corresponding cell in the output grid will be orange. If the majority are brown, then the corresponding cell in the output grid will be brown. If there\\'s a tie, the output cell will be orange. The blue cells are ignored for this transformation process.\\\\n15. To make the output, you have to take the largest square of the non-stripe color and compress it into a smaller identical square with each row and column of color representing a block of the larger color square from the input. All stripe color blocks are ignored or removed during this compression.\\\\n16. To make the output, you need to compress the input down by counting a group of four identical cells in the input as a single cell in the output grid. However, when an orange cell is encountered within these groups, it \\'overrules\\' any green cells, and the output for that group becomes orange. Gray cells in the input do not affect the output in any way.\\\\n17. When seeing the strips of green separated by lines, count all individual strips such that each time you encounter a non-green line, you count the preceding strip of green as one unit. Each flat compressed unit will form a row in the output.  So for each full set of green and other colors, you need to calculate the number of a full set of green and other colors horizontally. A full set of one row of other colors and green above and below equals one full set. After calculating the total number, create rows in the output equal to the number with only the green color. The width of the output is calculated by dividing the total width of the input by the number of full sets of other colors in one strip.\\\\n18. The output grid is smaller than the input grid and is filled with the color with the most occurrence in the input grid. Its sides are number of the majority colors divided by the number of minority colors, rounded to the nearest integer. In simpler terms, you count number of tiles with the majority color in the input grid, divide it by the number of tiles with the minority color, and make this value the side length of the output grid (rounding if necessary). Then fill this new grid with the majority color.\\\\n19. To generate the output, you need to follow these steps: First, consider all the cells with color that is present in the middle line of the input grid. Then in the output grid, represent them with their original color while the rest of the cells become black (or empty). Furthermore, you should shrink this new grid up to its minimum size by removing the excess black lines/columns full of zeros from all the four sides.\\\\n20. To make the output, you have to count how many green tiles are in each row and column in the stripe region where orange tiles are present. If the number of green tiles is equal to or exceeds 3, keep them in the output grid. If a row or column contains less than 3 green tiles, remove it from the output grid.\\\\n21. To make the output, you have to compress the input grid vertically, in a way that each band of the same color become represented only by one row, maintaining its color.\\\\n22. To get the output, you need to group the blocks. For each 5x5 box of the same color in the input, place a corresponding colored box in the output grid. Disregard the single row of the other color that separates the 5x5 boxes. The size and color of the box in the output depends on the number of similar colored boxes grouped together in the input.\\\\n23. To translate the grid from input to output, you can follow these steps:  - Identify the number of orange vertical lines in the input grid. - The length of the output grid on one side will correspond to this number. - Fill the entire output grid with green boxes.\\\\n24. To transform the grid, focus on each 4x4 (or remaining part in case of rounding up) area. Each small square in the output corresponds this larger square in the input. If the majority color in this large square from the input is the same as the color of the alternating rows in the input, color the output square with that color. Otherwise, color it with the same as the line color in the input.\\\\n25. To make the output, remove all the rows and columns that contain orange or blue color. Only care for rows and columns that are completely filled with green color.\\\\n26. To transform the grid, count every third purely green line from the top in the input grid. The output grid should have as many green boxes in a line as the counted green lines.\\\\n27. To make the output, you have to identify the color strip that goes vertically through the input, then create a square grid that is the width of this colored band. The output should be filled entirely with the color of that band.\\\\n28. To create the output from the input, you need to compress each 5x5 grid section of the original input into a single cell in the output. The output cell color depends on the colors of the cells in the corresponding 5x5 section of the input: If there is at least one purple cell, the output cell will be green, otherwise the output cell will be black.\\\\n29. To make the output, the transformation rule scans the input grid until it finds a row that matches the color of the stripes in the input grid. Once it finds such a row, it skips the same number of rows as there are rows between stripes (including the stripe itself) in the input grid before scanning again. It repeats this process, creating an output grid where each cell represents a region of the input grid of the dimension size between the stripes. Ultimately, the transformation creates a grid that\\'s a reduced version of the input grid, ignoring the striped lines.\\\\n30. To make the output, you have to look at the bottom half of the input grid and find the continuous area having the colour that appears most frequently (not including the orange). Copy this area and its corresponding part from the middle orange stripe to the output.\\\\n31. To make the output, you have to compress the input grid into the number of columns equivalent to the number of blues present in input grid. Following the rules; ignore all the rows which are fully orange and maintain all the color parts except orange in the output grid. The vertical order of colours (green and blue) in the output grid needs to match their order in the respective columns of the input grid.\\\\n32. To make the output, eliminate all disparate colored lines through each row and column. This results in a grid that maintains the same dimensions and a singular color in every cell.\\\\n33. To make the output, you have to calculate the width and height of the output to be approximately the number of green (3) squares in the input between consecutive lines of orange (7) or blue (1) squares. Fill all the slots in the output grid with green (3).   Note: If the width or height is smaller than 2, increase them to be 2. This might happen if there is only 1 gap between consecutive orange or blue lines. The color of lines (orange or blue) doesn\\'t seem to affect the transformation.\\\\n34. To make the output, you have to remove the repeating vertical columns with the different cells, and maintain only the original color which is most frequently occurring. Also, remove all the space between the columns.\\\\n35. To make the output, you have to cut off the portions of the grid that contain orange cells. Only keep the portion of the grid between two consecutive blue vertical lines, traversing from top to bottom. Then, take this middle section and scale it down to fit the size of the output grid, maintaining the aspect ratio.\\\\n36. To make the output, you have to scale down the original grid. Perform this by dividing the input in equally spaced segments both vertically and horizontally. Then replace each segment with the color that appears the most in that specific segment to form the output grid. If the segment has equal count of two or more colors, then take the color that comes first when counted from the top left of the segment.\\\\n37. We systematically count and reduce the number of consecutive occurrences of the same color present on the input grid lines to only four of the color blocks and then copy this transformed line down to the output grid. And we repeat this process until we have filled the output grid. The red line being only one color block wide will disappear in the final output as we are reducing any block wider than four.\\\\n38. To make the output, you have to convert each orange row in the input grid into a row in the output, and each blue square into a green square in the output. Ignore any green squares in the input, they do not appear in the output.\\\\n39. The output grid is a compressed version of the input grid where each patch of 5x5 same colored pixels in the input grid corresponds to one pixel of the same color in the output grid. Hence, a transformation that would achieve this is by taking the color of the central pixel within every 5x5 block to generate the respective pixel in the output grid. This downscaling operation maintains the color pattern.\\\\n40. To make the output, you have to rescale down the input grid by a factor of 5 in both dimensions. In this downscaled grid, check every 5x5 block in the input grid. If more than half of the cells in the 5x5 block are of the same color as the cells in the first row of the input grid, then the corresponding cell in the output grid should be that color. Otherwise, it should be the other color. Thus, the output grid is a reduced version of the input grid where each cell is based on the majority color in a corresponding block of the original grid.\\\\n41. To make the output, you need to remove the columns that have different color than the rest of the grid until you are left with a grid solely with one color. The rows and columns of this grid are equal to the number of similar color sections in the original grid.\\\\n42. To make the output, you only need to preserve the areas filled with teal color. Everything else should be colored in black. Count the number of solid teal squares in the original grid. Repeat this count in a square pattern in the output, starting from the top left and moving right then down.\\\\n43. The output grid is basically a representation of the counts of uniquely colored rows (not including the blue rows) in the input grid, with all squares being the color of the first colored square that appears in the uniquely colored row.\\\\n44. To make the output, you have to fill the whole output grid with the color that is not a part of continuous line in the input grid.\\\\n45. To transform the input to the output, you can treat the orange and blue colors in the input as barriers and take the largest continuous area of green color. The number of rows and columns of cells in the output grid reflect the number of lines of green cells surrounded by the barriers in the input grid. In other words, the transformation shrinks the input grid by turning each contiguous block of green between external blue and internal orange into single green cells, discarding the orange and blue cells in the process.\\\\n46. To make the output, you should take the color corresponding to the majority of the colors in the square and use it to create a small 1x1 square in the output grid, corresponding to the greater squares position in the input grid.\\\\n47. To make the output, you have to shrink the input grid by averaging the values in a region of 4x4 to create a single cell in the output grid. However, you have to exclude the rows filled with different color number (e.g., yellow/7 or teal/8) from the averaging process, these are ignored during the shrinking process. In the output grid, these ignored rows will not appear, resulting in the output grid being made of the remaining averaged cells only.\\\\n48. To make the output, you have to count the number of single-colored rows that have another color appearing only once on every row. The output grid size will be proportional to the number of such rows in vertical direction, and the color on the output grid will be the color of the other cells in these rows. The horizontal direction will be filled with this color entirely.\\\\n49. To make the output, you have to scale down the pattern on the grid. The number of square blocks on the output pattern corresponds to the number of orange lines in the input pattern. Keep the color of the majority of the blocks within each scaled down section. If the majority of the blocks within the large section in the input grid are green, then the corresponding block in the output grid should be green and vice versa. If there is an equal number of green and red blocks within a large section in the input grid, then the corresponding block in the output grid should be green.\\\\n50. To form the output, first identify the periodic pattern that alternates in the input. A period contains rows with the same repeating sequence followed by a row filled with the same number. The output should contain only the repeating sequence found in each period, even if the sequence repeats more than once in the same period. Each row in the output corresponds to one period in the input.\\\\n51. To create the output, you need to reduce the size of the blue and red squares in the input. All the colors remain the same, but the size of the individual squares is reduced. The output is a compressed form of the input. But no matter how each block is compressed, it becomes blue. So this may viewed as taking each 3x3 block of the input and reducing it to a single cell in the output. If that block contains at least one blue cell, the output cell is blue, even if the block contains red (orange) cells.\\\\n52. To make the output, we compress all sections of one color running top to bottom into a single row of that color. For instance, a vertical column of green will become one green cell in the output, whether it\\'s one cell tall or twenty cells tall in the input grid. The same goes for the alternate color as well. The width of the grid should remain the same, preserving the alternating color pattern in each row.\\\\n53. To make the output, count the number of distinct colored lines. The output grid is a square grid of a color. The side of the square is equal to the number of colored lines, and the grid is filled with the color of the first line.\\\\n54. To create the output, you need to count how many vertical lines of orange/blue are in the input, minus one - this gives you the height of your output. For the width of the output, count the number of the repeated green/white squares in each orange/blue line, excluding the first one in each line. Fill the grid with green cells.\\\\n55. To make the output, you have to consider only the area of the blue squares within the input grid. The orange lines serve as the boundaries for these blue sections. Take each blue section sqaure by square and map it into the output grid. You form the output grid by reshaping these blue sections into squares of equal size.\\\\n56. To make the output, you have to remove the orange line and join the two green rectangles side by side forming one large green grid. Also, all the corner blue grid cells must be replaced by green grid cells. The output grid should only contain green grid cells.\\\\n57. To get the output from the input, first find the sections as described above. Then, for each section, check if the number of non-green cells is equal to or greater than half of the total number of cells in the section. If it is, make all cells in the corresponding section in the output grid green. If not, leave them black.\\\\n58. To yield the output, start counting every time the teal and orange cells form a vertical line from top to bottom and make a horizontal line in the output at the spot where a full orange line appears in the input. Strip away all orange cells, and you\\'ll be left with a grid made up entirely of teal cells. Continue this pattern till all the cells from the input have been considered.\\\\n59. To make the output, the pattern involves minimizing the input grid by removing teal lines and collapsing down the height of each section of green. The orange sections are completely removed. The remaining green areas are re-shaped into a 5-column width grid. The height of each one depends on the original ratio of green:teal in the corresponding section of the input grid.\\\\n60. To make the output, the transformation involves identifying the dominant color in the grid (except black) and creating a grid of reduced size filled with the green color, which is the dominant color for all the cases.\\\\n61. Count the number of orange cells in each blue column of the input grid. For each column, fill in the same number of cells from the top in the corresponding column of the output grid with blue. Leave the rest of the cells black in the output grid.\\\\n62. To make the output, count the number of lines consisting of a single color either green or pink and make that the number of rows in the output grid. Count the maximum length of continuous single color (either green or pink) in a line and make that the number of columns in the output grid. Fill the output grid with the number associated with green.\\\\n63. To create the output grid, shrink every 5 by 5 square in the input grid to a single cell in the output grid by taking the most frequent color in that square. If the most frequent color is blue, set it to black in the output grid.\\\\n64. To make the output grid, you have to remove all the rows (those with teal, blue, or green) that contain repetitive color across the cells. Then, consider only those rows having sporadic occurrence of colors (black or orange) within the blue or green background. Now, reduce these remaining rows by four times to get them to the size of the output.\\\\n\"}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "Category 1: Rules based on the most frequent color\n1.

The output cell color depends on the colors of the cells in the corresponding 5x5 section of the input: If there is at least one purple cell, the output cell will be green, otherwise the output cell will be black.\n36. To make the output, you have to scale down the original grid. Perform this by dividing the input in equally spaced segments both vertically and horizontally. Then replace each segment with the color that appears the most in that specific segment to form the output grid. If the segment has equal count of two or more colors, then take the color that comes first when counted from the top left of the segment.\n39. The output grid is a compressed version of the input grid where each patch of 5x5 same colored pixels in the input grid corresponds to one pixel of the same color in the output grid. Hence, a transformation that would achieve this is by taking the color of the central pixel within every 5x5 block to generate the respective pixel in the output grid. This downscaling operation maintains the color pattern.\n40. To make the output, you have to res", "('[{\\'role\\': \\'system\\', \\'content\\': \\'You are a genius solving language puzzles.\\'}, {\\'role\\': \\'user\\', \\'content\\': \\'Given a list of rules, categorize them into eight distinct categories based on their similarities. For each category, synthesize the rules into a single, specific rule that combines the ideas of all rules in that category, while clearly differentiating it from the other categories.\\\\nThe new rule should be as specific as possible, following the format of the given rules.\\\\nThe new rule should be applicable without any information from the original rules - i.e. it should be standalone.\\\\n\\\\nRules:\\\\n1. To make the output, you have to move all the numbers towards the bottom of the grid while maintaining their left-to-right and top-to-bottom order. The empty spaces left by the moved numbers are filled with black cells.\\\\n2. To make the output, you must shift all the colored cells downwards so the first encounter of a colored cell starts from the bottom row of the grid. The rest of the cells should stay black. The colored cells still maintain their left or right positioning, they simply shift downwards.\\\\n3. To make the output, you have to swap the bottom half of the grid with the top half, cutting across the center. The top half should descend and the bottom half should ascend, resulting in an inversion of the input grid. Any block at the bottom that moves up and encounters colored blocks will push them to the right until there are no colored blocks left in its path.\\\\n4. To make the output, you have to move all the colored lines, without altering their original order, to the bottom of the grid and fill the left-over space with the black color.\\\\n5. To make the output, perform a 90 degree counter-clockwise rotation of the non-black cells in the grid. Black cells will remain in fixed positions and rotation should only account for the colored cells. After rotation if a cell is overlapped by two or more different colored cells then take the color of the cell that was initially located on the top or left in the input grid; perform this operation in clockwise fashion taking top first then right then bottom and then left cell color.\\\\n6. To make the output, you have to rotate the whole grid 90 degrees to left. This will result in the colored numbers being at the bottom of the grid in the output, preserving their relative order from right to left.\\\\n7. To make the output, you have to move all isolated figures to the bottom of the grid, preserving their horizontal positions. This operation can be thought as letting the colored blocks fall straight down until they hit the bottom of the grid or another colored block.\\\\n8. To make the output, you have to slide the non-black cells downwards, inside their respective columns, making all non-black cells accumulate at the bottom of the grid. The rest of the grid remains black (0).\\\\n9. To transform the grid, take the colored elements of the grid and move them to the last row, maintaining their columns unchanged and keeping the order of appearance from top to bottom. The result will be a last row filled with the colored elements from the entire grid, while all the other cells become black cells.\\\\n10. To make the output, you have to look for the columns that are not black (0s) in the input grid both at top half and bottom half. Transfer the top half colored columns to the bottom half, directly below the corresponding column in the top half, keeping the color of the blocks the same. The top half of each colored columns should then be made black or empty. The color in the block should remain the same and only the position is changing.\\\\n11. To make the output, you have to shift down numbers vertically inside the grid, while the black squares take the vacated positions at top. Basically, it is as if all colored squares are falling down due to gravity while the black squares ascend.   Note: If on any column there are multiple colored squares, the bottom-most colored square of input would remain at the bottom in output as well, and similarly the upper colored squares maintain their sequence.\\\\n12. To make the output, you have to move numbers placed in the top half of the grid (excluding middle row), to the corresponding positions in the bottom half (including the middle row). Everything else should be replaced with zeros.\\\\n13. To make the output, begin by copying the bottom row (last row) of colored cells to the topmost row. Then, copy each subsequent row from the bottom one row higher, replacing the previously colored row. The existing colors in each row are replaced with the colors from the corresponding row starting from the bottom. All other cells remains black. This transformation could be viewed as mirroring the colored part of the grid with axis being the \\\\\\'middle row\\\\\\'.\\\\n14. To make the output, you have to take all the colored cells in the three leftmost columns of the grid and move them to the bottom. The moved cells keep their order from top to bottom. After this procedure, the rest of the grid cells from the top should be filled with black.\\\\n15. To make the output, you have to rotate the grid 90 degrees clockwise. The first column of the input becomes the last row of the output, retaining the order from top to bottom. The rest of the cells in the output are black.\\\\n16. To make the output, you have to reverse the order of all the rows in the grid. The first row becomes the last row, the second row becomes the second to the last row, so on and so forth. This is simply flipping the grid vertically.\\\\n17. To make the output, you have to shift non-black cells down until they hit an empty space blask cell or reach the bottom, keeping in column order. For instance, in the first column, there are non-black cells, so place them at the bottom of the column. Then, fill the rest of the column with black cells. Repeat this process for other columns.\\\\n18. To get the output, you have to move all colored cells to the bottom without changing their relative order horizontally and vertically, while black cells are moved to the upper part of the grid. In other words, the colors seem to \"settle\" to the bottom of the grid.\\\\n19. To make the output, you need to pick the color with the most frequency in each line and fill the entire line within the black flanks with this color. Take note that the topmost and bottommost black line should remain the same. For the leftmost column, copy the old grey line downwards to the bottom of the grid. Then, for the rightmost column, copy the uppermost color downwards, skipping the grey cells. Continue this process for every subsequent color until the rightmost column is filled out.\\\\n20. To make the output, transfer the colored cells to the lower half of the grid, and keep the order of the colored cells from left to right. The black cells in the upper half of the grid and the empty cells in the lower half remain black.\\\\n21. To make the output, you have to take any square from the top of the grid that is not a black square and move it to the bottom of the grid. Then, move up each subsequent non-black square in the column so that they occupy the space of the previous non-black square in the given column and are in the same order as they were originally. The top squares filled with black squares previously occupied by non-black squares are then refilled with black squares.\\\\n22. To make the output, all rows are shifted down such that the last row of colored cells moves to the first row, replacing it. The cells in the last row are replaced with the shifted cells from the row above. The black cells follow the shift in the transformation. The last non-black cell (color or numeral) of the last column from the first non-black row gets appended to the end of the last non-black row. If the last non-black cell is in the last non-black row itself, it stays in its position. The columns without any colored cells or numerals don\\\\\\'t get appended in the last filled row.\\\\n23. To make the output, you have to shift the colored numbers downwards until they meet a cell that isn\\\\\\'t black. In case the number is already at the bottom-most row, it doesn\\\\\\'t move. The numbers push the colors underneath them downwards as they move. The black cells that are left empty get filled with blacks. So, it\\\\\\'s like every colored number is falling to the bottom until it hits another color or the bottom of the grid.\\\\n24. To make the output, you have to shift colored cells in a certain row to the bottom row, maintaining their original order from left to right. The operation affects only the colored cells in rows where there is one or more colored cells and the rest are black. Turning them black and moving them to the bottom, except for the very first row where color shows up. It then copies the color pattern onto all the following black rows, until a new color pattern is encountered.\\\\n25. To make the output, you have to find the first color that appears in the grid, then fill it from top to bottom in each column (ignoring the black cells) until you meet the next color that appears as you scan through the grid from top to bottom and left to right. Repeat this process for all colors in the grid. Essentially you are sorting the colors in each column from the earliest to appear on the grid to the latest to appear, based on a top to bottom and left to right scan.\\\\n26. To make the output, you have to take the non-zero elements and shift them down the grid towards the bottom row, while maintaining the same column position. Empty spaces (0s) should fill the spaces once occupied by the numbers that have moved down.\\\\n27. To make the output, you have to move all colored cells down until they hit another color cell or the bottom of the grid, maintaining their horizontal position. The place of the cell in the grid that is moving down is filled with a black cell.\\\\n28. To make the output, you have to: 1. Ignore all the numbers in the top two rows of the grid.  2. Move the rest of the numbers (except the zero) upward until they reach the same level as their corresponding spot in the bottom two rows.  3. Any number that is above another will swap places and be placed directly below it in the grid.\\\\n29. To create the output grid, one needs to shift all non-black cells downward so that the non-black cells are in the bottom most rows of their respective columns. All the cells through which numbers are shifted become black. Black cells that are at the top remain black.\\\\n30. The transformation involves moving the colored boxes in the input grid to the bottom row of the output grid, while preserving their relative positions to each other (left-to-right). i.e. colored boxes are falling down to the lowest possible point remaining in their original column. The colored boxes are brought down to the bottom row, while the rest of the squares remain black. In case of multiple colored boxes in a column, they maintain their top to bottom order in the final row.\\\\n31. To make the output, you have to move all colored grids to the bottom of the grid, maintaining the order from the left to right for each color, and filling in from bottom to top on the grid. The remaining cells are black.\\\\n32. To make the output, you have to move all the cells that are not black from the leftmost column to the bottom row, in the same order. Then, move the cells from the rightmost column to the bottom row, but in reversed order. All the other cells should be colored black. If there are multiple colored cells in a column, the upper one moves first.\\\\n33. The whole transformation process can be described as a process of shifting the cells contents to the bottom while the empty space fills the top part. Specifically, the transformation entails shifting the colored cells in the vertical direction such that the top of the grid primarily consists of black cells (0s) and the bottom consists of whatever numbers were in the input, maintaining their original order from left to right. The rule can also be visualized as moving non-zero numbers to the bottom of their column, with the top of the column getting filled with zeroes.\\\\n34. To make the output, you need to take the unique sequence of numbers in the last row of colors and replicate it upwards for each colored line that you find above the black line. The topmost color line repeats the sequence of the line immediately below it. The second color line from the top repeats the sequence of the third color line, and so forth. The repetitions replace the existing color pattern in each line, but keep the same background color (black).\\\\n35. To form the output, you have to keep the first non-black row from the bottom as is on the bottom row and the rest of the rows are filled with the above ones. The remaining cells at the top are filled with black.\\\\n36. Transform the grid by rearranging non-zero values such that they are ordered bottom-up in each column, maintaining their original order. Assume 0 is empty space. All 0s (or empty cells) should be moved to the top of the grid. In other words, gravity is applied to the non-zero values in each column until they hit the bottom of the grid.\\\\n37. To make the output, you have to move the non-black numbers to the bottom part of the grid, while maintaining their original order and position. Imagine as though gravity is pulling the non-black numbers down.\\\\n38. To make the output, you need to take the colored squares from the first and second segments of the input grid and align them in reverse order. The first segment is everything until the row with the maximum number of colored squares, not counting black squares. The second segment consists of the row with the maximum number of colored cells and everything below it. In the output, colors from the first segment make up the bottom of the grid (but in the same left to right order they had in the input), and colors from the second segment make up the top of the grid (once again in the same left to right order). All unused squares get filled with black.\\\\n39. To make the output, you have to shift every row except the last one down by one row. The previous last row will come to the first row and all the cell values will be moved to their corresponding position in the next row.\\\\n40. To make the output, you have to shift all non-black cells one row down, wrapping them to the top if they are in the last row. Hence, the last non-black cell in each column moves to the first row in the same column. The other cells move down one row. All black cells remain in their original spots.\\\\n41. To make the output, you have to move all colored pixels in the input grid vertically from the position where they found in the input grid to the lowest free cell in the same column in the output grid.\\\\n42. To make the output, you have to rearrange the colored numbers into a diagonal order from bottom left to top right. The top right corner number in the input moves to the right side of last row in the output, the numbers from left edge of the input fill in the diagonal line from bottom left to top right position in the output,  and rest of the positions are filled with black.\\\\n43. To make the output, you need to shift all non-black colored boxes down the grid to fill any black spaces immediately beneath them, as if they had gravity pulling them down, until they reach the bottom or another coloured box below them is obstructing their path. Any boxes that are removed leave a black space in their previous place. Remember that the non-black boxes don\\\\\\'t combine or change color when they move. They simply slide into the black space below them.\\\\n44. To make the output, you have to rotate the entire grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise, while preserving the black (empty) cells. The black cells along the periphery remain in place, while the interacting colored cells rotate within them.\\\\n45. To transform the input into the output, the colored numbers in the grid move straight down until they hit the bottom of the grid or another colored cell. All empty cells made by this movement are filled with black cells. The colored cell in the bottom-right cell moves down as well, even if this cell is outside of the original grid.\\\\n46. To make the output, keep the colored column as is. For the remaining part of the grid, look at the colors in the horizontal row in other part of the grid. If a color is seen for the first time in the grid, use it to replace all zeros in the corresponding horizontal row from the colored column. Repeat this till the last row.\\\\n47. To make the output, you have to capture the list of non-black numbers from the topmost row, omitting the first (leftmost) one. Then, append the non-black numbers from the first column (top to bottom) to the previously captured list. In the resulting list, replace the corresponding cells in the grid starting from the cell in the bottom left corner, moving upwards, and then continuing from the bottom of the next column. An upward reverse-read column by column. All the other cells should be transformed to black.\\\\n48. To make the output, you need to slide the single-color cell (if available) from each column to be in the lowest row of the same column, replacing the cell that was originally there. If a column is entirely black except for the bottom row, take the color from the bottom row of the column directly to the right to fill in. If the last column is all black, keep it all black.\\\\n49. To make the output, you have to move all the numbers from the last row to the first and then move every other cell up one row, excluding black cells. In case of any empty cell left after moving, make it black. So, in essence, the transformation is that all cells move up by one row and the cells from the last row move to the top of the grid preserving its order. The cells remain in their original columns. Remaining cells are set to black.\\\\n50. To make the output, observe how the colored cells in the columns are pushed to the bottom of the grid, following the order they were in and filling the rest of the above cells with black.\\\\n51. To transform the input into the output, you have to move the colored numbers on the grid from top to bottom: every row with color cells transfers its colored cells to the row downwards. The bottom row transfers its colors to the first row from the top. At the same time, if a certain row has multiple colored numbers, the one on the right transfers to the cell on the same column as the leftmost colored number in the row above.\\\\n52. To make the output, you have to  shift all coloured cells in each column down to the lowest row within the column. Replace empty squares with black squares (0\\\\\\'s).\\\\n53. To make the output, you have to move all the coloured cells to the bottom. Imagine that gravity is pulling the coloured cells downwards while leaving the black cells (empty spaces) at their original position.   The order of the colored cells should be maintained in the process, and they should stack up from the bottom of their respective columns. If a column has more than one colored cell, the colored cell from the top moves down to the bottom first, followed by the next topmost colored cell and so on.\\\\n54. To make the output, you have to shift rows so that the black rows become the top rows and all the other rows move to a position corresponding to their original location, relative to each other.\\\\n55. To make the output, you have to rotate the whole grid to 180 degrees. The data, which is right side up in the upper row, is moved to the bottom and turned upside down, and the information in the other rows is stringed up in reverse order, moving towards the upper side.\\\\n56. To make the output, you have to shift the rectangles one row down whenever there is a black row above. The last row of rectangles gets the colors of the topmost non-black row.\\\\n57. To make the output, you have to move the colored pattern downwards. For every row in the grid, the current row takes the values of the row above it. The topmost row becomes completely black. The pattern shifts downwards by exactly one row.\\\\n58. To make the output, you have to rearrange the color cells in each column by shifting them downwards so that the colored cells are grouped together at the bottom of the grid, maintaining the order from top to bottom. Black cells should occupy the empty spaces in the top after the color cells are moved down.\\\\n59. To make the output, you have to shift all the non-black cells to the bottom while maintaining the column. Therefore, imagine the non-black cells falling to the bottom of the grid like in a gravity-based puzzle game. The rest of the cells in the grid remain black.\\\\n60. To make the output, you have to take the colored numbers from the top row of input and place them, in the same order as they appear from left to right, in the units of the bottommost row from left to right. The same process is applied for each subsequent row from bottom to top, filling in the colors in the same order from the top row. The black units in the output grid correspond to the black units in the input grid.\\\\n61. To make the output, you have to horizontally flip the grid and then replace all cells just above the first row of non-zero cells with zero.\\\\n62. To transform the input into the output, all the colored elements need to be moved to the bottom rows while maintaining their relative positions, with the top rows left empty (black).\\\\n63. To make the output, you need to move the colors from the top to the bottom. For each color, the final position in the lowermost row should be the same as its initial column position, if there\\\\\\'s already a color present in the same column; put it above that color. The colors are preserved in their original order from top to bottom in each column.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "After analyzing the rules, they can be categorized into eight distinct categories based on their similarities:\n\nCategory 1: Rules involving moving colored cells/numbers to the bottom of the grid while maintaining their order.\nCategory 2: Rules involving rotation of the grid.\nCategory 3: Rules involving swapping or reversing the order of the grid.\nCategory 4: Rules involving shifting of rows or columns.\nCategory 5: Rules involving specific column or row operations.\nCategory 6: Rules involving color filling or replacement.\nCategory 7: Rules involving gravity-like movement of colored cells/numbers.\nCategory 8: Rules involving complex or unique transformations.\n\nSynthesized rules for each category:\n\n1.

To make the output, you should mirror the blue vertical line on the grid. So there will be blue vertical lines before and after the rectangles and plus signs. Furthermore, fill the blue vertical line in horizontally to the right of any teal symbols.\\\\n2. To make the output, you have to replace the black squares in the input grid with teal squares in the output grid for cases where the corresponding square in the third space from the blue stripe (either left or right) contains a teal square. For all other squares, the colors remain the same.\\\\n3. To make the output, you have to use the middle teal line as the centerline and reflect the blue rectangles that are from the top section in the top half of the grid. Every blue pixel that is directly above the teal row should be reflected vertically across the teal row.  This reflection will create new teal pixels that overlap with the blue pixels in the bottom rectangle. If a pixel is already blue, it should remain blue, but if it\u2019s black, it will turn teal. The rest of the grid, including the background black pixels and the original teal pixels in the two teal rows, remains unchanged.\\\\n4. To make the output, you have to follow this pattern. Find the three columns after the blue line in the upper part of image, if the cell is black in the corresponding column in the lower part of image, turn it to blue (1). For other columns, left it as normal. This transformation is applied to the whole grid regardless of the color or position.\\\\n5. To make the output, you have to repeat the red pattern of the sequence of each row in the central square (between top and bottom boundary of blue lines) for all black squares in that row residing between two vertical blue stripes. Filling only the black squares between the two vertical blue lines, the first black box, should be filled taking value from red color in the same row on the most left side; the second box should be filled taking the second red on the same row, whereas the third black box should be filled taking the red color again from the most left (repeat from first red).  Fill the black boxes inside stripes from left to right following the red pattern in the stripes of their row.\\\\n6. To make the output, you have to mirror the leftmost and rightmost fuschia patterns symmetrically to fill the middle space. The symbols in the central column remain unchanged. Blue vertical lines are kept at the same position.\\\\n7. To make the output, you have to mirror all teal pixels that are present on the left side of every cyan line to its right side. So any teal pixel that is n-pixels left of the line, becomes a teal pixel n-pixels right of the line.\\\\n8. The transformation involves copying the blue vertical lines from the input grid to the output grid as is. For each segmented square partitioned by these blue lines in the input grid, fill in corresponding blue boxes at the same places where there are red boxes present in the input grid\\'s square section only if the number of red boxes in this section is more than 1. Ensure the black boxes remain black in the output grid.\\\\n9. To make the output, you need to reflect the cells of the red shape in the teal line adjacent to the shape. This means that each cell in the red shape is copied to an equivalent position in the adjacent cell grid delimited by the teal bars. The reflection is such that the original and the copied shapes face each other as in a mirror.\\\\n10. To make the output, you have to switch the place of any red and grey blocks in each 4x4 square surrounded by the blue lines, with exception to the most central column where the grey blocks are. If a red block is at the left half, move it to the same position at the right half and vice versa. If it is on the most central column, leave it there. Do this operation independently for each four 4x4 squares.\\\\n11. To make the output, you have to take each column has been reflected on the blue line. If there is a red cell on one side of the blue line, it also appears on the other side at the same distance. The process is done both for up and down part.\\\\n12. To make the output, you have to mirror the red shapes found in the upper region of the shape down to the lower region, while maintaining their mirrored positions. The red shapes from the center row should be duplicated proportionally to both the upper and lower sections as well. Essentially, the red shapes from every section should be mirrored to the opposite one, with the center row acting as the line of symmetry. The original alignment of the tile colors present on the squares inside the figure outline should remain unchanged, only the red shapes move.\\\\n13. To create the output grid, the pattern of green cells in each segment of the input must be mirrored along the central vertical axis of each segment. This transformation then displays the same pattern of green cells on the right side of the blue line in each segment, as per the pattern on the left side of each blue line in the input grid.\\\\n14. To make the output, you have to transform the input by replacing every black cell that is surrounded by non-black cells (either horizontally, vertically, or both), with a teal cell. This rule should be applied to the regions separated by the teal strips.\\\\n15. In the output, you have to rotate the red shapes  90 degrees clockwise about the center of the blue vertical lines.\\\\n16. To achieve the transformation from input to output, every square that is immediately adjacent and to the right of a blue or red square is changed to the same color (blue or red). However, ensure that this only occurs within the context of the blue and red bands and does not affect the black area in the middle or the white area outside the bands. If there are no coloured squares on the right then maintain the current colour.\\\\n17. To make the output, you should make the blue sections match the teal line in the middle of the input exactly by replacing the zeros with ones to align with the position of ones in the teal line.   For example, in the row above the teal line, if there is a one at the 8th position in the teal line from the left, there should be a one at the 8th position in the blue section above the teal line from the left. If there is a one at the 10th position from the left in the teal line, there should be a one at the 10th position in the blue section from the left. The same transformation applies for the blue section below the teal line.\\\\n18. To form the output, you need to mirror over the vertical center line (the line of teal stones in the middle of the input) the yellow stones found within these corridors. So, if a yellow stone exists in the left half of the corridor, it should be mirrored over to the right half of the corridor and vice versa. The position of the stone within the corridor should remain the same in the transformation.\\\\n19. To make the output, you have to take the half of the square that is closest to the light blue line and replicate it on the half of the square that is farthest from the light blue line. In each quadrant, if there is grey pixel in a particular position close to the blue line, copy that to the same relative position on the other half side. If there is no grey pixel in a position close to the blue line, then make sure the corresponding position on the other side is also black.\\\\n20. To make the output, you have to insert teal cells at the same row for each of the red cells between teal lines. Red cells on the edge of black cells will correspond to teal cells on the edge of matching black cells (mirror image). Red cells on the edge of teal cells will correspond to teal cells in the middle of the black cells.\\\\n21. To make the output, you have to maintain the blue lines and the yellow patterns in their original position, for the green patterns in the first and the third section fill the black squares between the green ones with blue squares. For the middle section fill the black squares between two green squares with blue squares, if there is only one green square in the column fill the three black squares below with blue squares.\\\\n22. The grid transformation is based on the X shape logic. The X shape is divided into four quadrants. When you see the first color to the left or the right quadrant, color the corresponding position in the opposing quadrant. While the input grid only have the X marked one side, the mirrored X needs to be marked in the output grid.\\\\n23. To make the output,  duplicate the green patterns that appear in the bottom half of the grid (rows below the bottom blue line) into the top half right above the top blue line, while leaving the original green pattern still there. Similarly, duplicate the green patterns that appear in the top half of the grid (rows above the top blue line) into the bottom half right below the bottom blue line, still leaving the original green pattern still there. Green blocks are placed symmetrical to the blue strips that crossing the grid.\\\\n24. To make the output, you have to reflect the image of the green circles vertically over the teal line it is closest to. The red circles will stay in the same position.\\\\n25. The transformation involves filling in the sections on either side of the central blue stripe with a reflection of the grey designs. The original grey pattern in each section is reflected horizontally about the blue stripe. The grid remains the same with the exception of the areas that are filled in.\\\\n26. The transformation rule is a mirror reflection of the entire grid. The resulting output grid is filled with the mirror reflection of every yellow dot across the teal line in its section, where the reflected dot replaces the spot in the grid corresponding to the color (red or black) with blue. All teal lines remain the same.\\\\n27. To transform the grid, mirror the patterns in the top and bottom group on the mid-vertical line through the middle of the horizontal teal lines. Maintain the horizontal teal lines in the same position. You should replace the black squares with teal squares if it lies in between the two horizontal teal lines.\\\\n28. To make the output, you have to copy/mirror the red diagonal stripes and replace it into the area between the blue stripes in the middle section. Make sure that the placement of the stripes are preserved. This transformation does not affect any other elements in the grid.\\\\n29. To make the output, you have to identify the green patches in the input and replace the black squares surrounding these green squares (horizontally and vertically but not diagonally) with blue while maintaining the remaining grid cells intact. The result is a propagation of blue around the original green patches.\\\\n30. To form the output, the pattern starts by turning the white spaces in between the red pixels inside each area into blue. In other words, to fill in with blue color the spaces between red blocks in each row where there are already red blocks.\\\\n31. To make the output, you have to replace every block in the middle column between the two teal lines with a teal block if the block above it or below it is not black. Otherwise, you keep the block. Carry out this process rectangle by rectangle between the two teal lines and repeat the process for the entire grid.\\\\n32. To make the output, copy the blue line from the input into the same position. Then, copy every figure from the input into the same position in the output, but refill these figures with the color blue.\\\\n33. To make the output, you have to keep the blue vertical line unchanged, and each green square in the input keeps its position but is mirrored to the opposite side of the blue line in the same quadrant it was placed in the input. The original green square and its mirrored counterpart will form a pair of squares symmetric to the blue line within the same quadrant.\\\\n34. To make the output, you have to look into the top yellow triangle and the bottom upside down triangle. Copy the triangle\\'s pattern and place it in between two blue intersections, but ignoring the intersection line itself.\\\\n35. To make the output, you need to duplicate the pattern of the colored shapes in the outer bands into the middle band on either side of the teal line, keeping everything else the same. All non-black colors are mapped to blue in the new grid.\\\\n36. To make the output, you have to mirror the configuration of colored cells in the middle of the grid, between the two horizontal colored lines, diagonally. The transformation process includes replacing the black cells along the main diagonal with colored cells, if the symmetric cell in the other quadrant of the grid is a colored cell.\\\\n37. For transforming the input grid into the output grid, an observation can be made that the blue line in the grid acts like a mirror. The pattern on the left side of the blue line is mirrored on the right side in the output grid. But in contrast to a perfect mirror, each colour has its specific mirror counterpart. The black color in the input mirrors as a blue in the output, the red color mirrors itself and white mirrors as a black.\\\\n38. To make the output, you have to mirror the green square and its neighboring black squares which are above or below the blue column. The mirrored squares are to be placed correspondingly in the black squares opposite to the blue column. No other elements are transformed or moved, including the red lines.\\\\n39. To create the output, you have to reflect the grid vertically and then find the midpoint from the blue stripe to the edge of the grid. Then fill all empty cells above the midpoint with the blue color, but do not change the cells in the blue stripe or the ones that were originally green.\\\\n40. To make the output, you have to perform the following steps on the input grid: 1. Identify the 5x5 grid in the middle of the input grid. This is symmetrical between the 5x5 grids at the corners. 2. Replace Black with Blue on every cell in the middle 5x5 grid where the equivalent cell in the corner 5x5 grid is Red. 3. For every Blue cell in the middle of the input grid that now has a Blue cell in the same position in the middle grid, change that Blue cell to be Red in the output grid. This applies to all rows in the grid, including the entirely Blue rows.\\\\n41. To make the output you should find the red clusters on the left side of the blue line and reflect them on the right side of the blue line. The blue lines remain in the same position. Note that for the reflection, the axis of symmetry is always the blue vertical line closest to the red shape.\\\\n42. To make the output, you have to place blue segments in the black cells surrounding the existing green lines in the top and middle sections. Then fill the black cells surrounding the green segment in the bottom section. The blue divider stays in the same place.\\\\n43. To make the output, you have to locate the red squares in each quadrant (top left, top right, bottom left, bottom right) and replace all the squares on the corresponding row and column with blue squares. However, this transformation should not cross the middle blue lines. Each quadrant should be considered independently.\\\\n44. To make the output, you have to find the four quadrants or zones generated by the blue stripes. Then you take every red box - when it appears in a quadrant - and you create a mirror-like replica of them on the opposite quadrant with blue stripes as the mirror axis. Note: in quadrants without red boxes initially, you have to remove any red boxes created due to replication from other quadrants.\\\\n45. To make the output, you have to replace the red squares with blue squares such that each red square in the top and bottom three rows and middle row of each set are replaced. However, avoid replacing the red squares lying on the blue line. The position of blue squares in the input does not change in the output.\\\\n46. To make the output, you have to replace every single instance of a black cell that is surrounded horizontally by a blue cell on each side with a blue cell. Retain all the other cells as they are in the input grid.\\\\n47. To make the output, you have to make copy of the green pattern in each quadrant to the blue line, that is, to replace the black cells in the blue line with the green cells. The green pattern is repeated in the same way for each row i.e., if there\\'s green positioned at second index in quadrant, it\\'s reflected on to the blue line at second index from rigid side.\\\\n48. To make the output, you have to take the shape of the teal cells and mirror it between the blue lines such that they follow a specific pattern which looks like it\\'s radiating from the blue lines. Also, ensure that every alternating black cell in between the blue lines is replaced with a blue cell as well.\\\\n49. To produce the output, you have to mirror the red triangles that appear in the top central area, below the first blue horizontal line, and in the bottom section, above the second blue horizontal line. If a triangle (3 consecutive red cells) was horizontally right from the first vertical teal line and horizontally left from the second vertical teal line in the input, then you mirror this shape around the center vertical line in the output in such a way that it stays in the same vertical position but changes the horizontal one. Repeat this for every triangle in the top and bottom sections.\\\\n50. To create the output, copy the blue stripe data from the mid region of the input grid and insert it into the same column of the red or green patterned area above or below, but only insert into the black cells. Leave the blue stripe and black cells as they are in these patterned areas.\\\\n51. To make the output, you have to mirror the 3 panes onto the blue strip. In other words, any teal (3) square immediately adjacent to a blue (1) strip is copied onto the blue (1) strip. These new blue squares does not replace the teal squares that was there before, if any.  Other features or concepts: It is important to note that the order of copying is from outside to the center of the grid.\\\\n52. To make the output, you have to replace all black squares in the vertical middle of each quadrant (not including the teal lines) with teal squares, keeping all other elements the same.\\\\n53. The transformation involves replacing the black boxes around the red figures with teal boxes, but only on the right-hand side of each red figure. This creates a mirror image of the red figure outlined by teal boxes on its right side. The rest of the grid remains unchanged.\\\\n54. To make the output, you have to push each elementary figure until occupying a sodium chloride (salt crystal) lattice structure in which the 0 and the 3 are substituting themselves in an alternating pattern, starting with 0 for the upper most and left most square of the lattice. The process shall be repeated until all the quadrants are filled with this lattice like structure. The blue cross stays the same.\\\\n55. To produce the output grid, first, retain the blue lines and the green symbols as they are from the input grid. Then, for each quadrant, copy the green symbol of the quadrant and mirror it along the central vertical line of that quadrant.\\\\n56. To create the desired output from the input grid, the transformation requires reflecting the red squares across the closest blue line. In particular, copy the red squares to the opposite sides of the blue line on which they were originally placed. Leave black or blue squares unaltered and preserve the \\'empty\\' or black cells within the implied grid defined by red and blue cells also as black cells in the output.\\\\n57. To make the output, you need to mirror each image within its respective quadrant diagonally (from top left to bottom right of the quadrant). The symmetry is achieved by substituting the cells in the lower half of each quadrant with the mirror image of the cells in the top half of the same quadrant. The blue lines remain unchanged.\\\\n58. To make the output, you have to mirror the contents from each half of the grid across the blue line. After mirroring, all green entities that moved from the left side to the right side of the blue line, and from the right to the left, become yellow. In other words, the yellow entities on the right hand side are replaced with a mirror image of the green entities on the left hand side and vice versa, with green becoming yellow upon crossing the blue line.\\\\n59. To make the output, replace every black square in the regions between the teal stripes with a blue square, while leaving all other colors unchanged. Note that the blue conversion should take place only if there is a red square somewhere between the teal stripes in the same row of the quadrant.\\\\n60. To make the output, you have to maintain the structure of the input, but mirror the figures in the blue column i.e. copy to its next cell towards right and left horizontally. This mirror pattern is also copied to the cells in between two purple lines wherever there is empty space.\\\\n61. To make the output, you have to replace the red cells (colour code: 3) at the exactly midway point along each line perpendicular to the purplish-grey bar, in the area bounded by the bar and the previous red cells from the border. If two red cells appear on this line, consider the one closer to the bar, and if there is a tie, consider the one on the right side of the bar.\\\\n62. To form the output grid, the yellow cells between the two patterns of 4x4 in both parts in the input have to be replaced with blue colour. That means, the yellow figures are moved from below and above the middle lines to the side. So effectively, the yellow patterns become part of the blue line separating the two figures in black. This transformation rule creates a mirror effect: what is on one side of the blue line (above or below) is mirrored on the other side. The cells outside these figures remain the same.\\\\n63. To make the output, replace every red square that borders a blue square with a blue square. A red square is considered to be neighboring a blue square if it is directly above, under, to the left, or to the right of a blue square.\\\\n64. To form the output from the input, all the changes occur on the black squares that are immediately located to the right of the central blue squares (vertically symmetrical to the blue line). The rules are as follows:  1. If the cell to the left of the cell (same row) is blue and the cell at the bottom of the current cell (same column) is black, then the current cell should be painted blue. 2. If the cell to the left of the cell (same row) is black and the cell at the bottom of the current cell (same column) is blue, then the current cell should be painted blue. 3. All other cells remain the same.\\\\n\"}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "Category 1: Mirroring along a vertical line\n1.

To create the output, each color within the smaller square representations will be replaced as follows:  - Red is replaced with dark blue. - Dark blue is replaced with black. - Dark green is replaced with dark green. - Any black will be replaced with dark blue only if it\u2019s focal within the smaller square(central cell when you take 3x3 square inside large one), otherwise it stays black.\\\\n5. To make the output, first, you count blue spots on the left, right, up, and bottom sides, and also in the overall grid. Draw this count in a 5x3 grid in the order top-left, top-right, middle (total count), bottom-left, bottom-right. Spot counts should be represented as green dots (represented by 3) in the output. The cells in which no spots are counted should be kept as black.\\\\n6. To make the output, you have to condense the input grid. Each segment of 6x10 in the input grid corresponds to one cell in the output. You have to count the number of blue, red, and green squares in each segment. The color with the highest count determines the color of the corresponding cell in the output. If blue squares are most frequent, the corresponding cell in the output should be black (0). If red squares are most frequent, the corresponding cell should be colored teal (4). If green squares are most frequent or if there is a tie between the number of squares of different colors, the corresponding cell in the output should be colored black by default.\\\\n7. To create the output, try to focus on the positions of the red dots in the initial grid. Every red dot corresponds to a green square in the output. The sequence of the blue dots depicts the grey shapes\\\\\\' location in the output. The blue squares\\\\\\' center in the input grid relates to the output grid\\\\\\'s green square\\\\\\'s center.\\\\n8. To create the output, split the grid into 9 equal squares. If a square contains green squares, then, regardless of the pattern or arrangement, replace all numbers in that square in the output grid with the number 3 (turquoise). If there are no green squares in a section, replace all numbers in that square in the output grid with the number 0 (black).\\\\n9. The output grid can be derived from the input in the following way:    - Count the total number of colored cells in the 10 row blocks of the input.     - Build an output row for each 10-row block in the input. The output row should consist of three cells.    - If the count of colored cells in a 10-row block is more than or exactly 10, the corresponding cell color will be dark green in the output.    - If the count of colored cells in a 10-row block is less than 10 but positive, the corresponding cell color will be teal in the output.    - When there are no colored cells in the block, the corresponding cell in the output row will be colored black. So the transformation pattern here can be said as The input grid is divided into 10x30 sections and then mapped to individual cell in the output grid after color aggregation following the stated rules.\\\\n10. To make the output, you have to take the central 5x5 grid from the input. Then, for every cell in this 5x5 grid, if the cell was part of the colored line in the input, it should be colored brown. If the cell was not part of the colored line in the input, it should be colored black. The result should be a 5x5 grid part of it being a brown line.\\\\n11. The output grid comprises of 3 colours, black (0), green (3) and purple (4). The transformation pattern appears to be based on a reduction and simplification of the input grid. Specifically, the red colour (2) is replaced with green (3) in the output while the blue (1) is removed. The purple (4) blocks are maintained and some black (0) blocks are also replaced with purple. The grid is also reduced down to a smaller size in the process.\\\\n12. The colored lines in the input grid are transformed in the output grid in a compressed form following these rules:   - The color features are reduced to their minimal form where straight lines become a single cell in the output. - When a straight colored line intersects with another line of the same color these intersections points are also reduced into a single cell. - If there are any black cells that intersect with a colored line or intersection point, these black cells remain as black cells in the output. - The same transformation rule applies to all color lines in the input. For example, the red cells in the input become 4 yellow cells in the output. The 4 yellow cells still follow the same straight line/intersection point rule.\\\\n13. To make the output, you have to condense the input into a 5x3 grid. Both red and blue pixels are represented by the number 4 in the condensed output. Blue pixels are directly translated to the output grid. Red pixels are only represented if there is no blue pixel present in that condensed area\\\\n14. To create the output, you need to understand the pattern created by the colored dots. The blue dots (1) outline the shape of the object, the green dots (2) fill in the object, and the red dots (5) draw a line through the middle of the object. This creates an image of a fish.   The final transformation is made by replacing the blue outline (1) with black (0), the green fill (2) with blue (1) , the red line (5) with green (2), and the rest of the grid remains black (0). When the image of the fish is turned sideways and these color transformations are made, you get a simplified fish icon.\\\\n15. To make the output, you have to assign a color for each unique pattern, and shrink them to fit in the output grid. Red + symbol translates to the purple, blue + symbol translates to black and green square translates to white.\\\\n16. To make the output, you have to count the number of colored squares within each 10x10 section of the input grid. If the count of blue is greater than the count of orange or green, color the corresponding square in the output grid as blue; if the count of red is greater than the count of blue, color the corresponding square in the output grid as red; if the count of green is greater than the count of blue or red, color the corresponding square in the output grid as green.\\\\n17. To make the output, you have to collapse each 10x10 subgrid of the input grid into a single pixel of the output grid. The color of the pixel in the output grid is determined by the highest numbered color present in the corresponding sub grid. If a sub grid contains both blue and green, the color of that pixel of the output grid will be green, as green is a higher number than blue. If a sub grid only contains blue, the pixel will be blue. If a sub grid only contains black, the pixel will also be black.\\\\n18. To make the output, you have to count the number of red squares in the top left 10x10 square, middle 10x10 square and bottom right 10x10 square. Replace the red with gray if the count is less than 15 and replace with blue if the count is more than 15. Keep the black squares as it is.\\\\n19. To make the output, you have to remove all elements which are around the letters, change all the red color in the input into the black color in the output, map blue dots on black background and the intersections of blue and green dots on the red background, convert the green dots not intersecting with the blue ones into the red color, all the yellow dots convert into the blue color.\\\\n20. The transformation seems to be based on the count of each color in the input lining up remarkably with the color in the output. For example, an output of blue can indicate the presence of a blue figure in the input. The output of a grey square indicates the presence of a grey line, horizontal or vertical in the input. The positions in the output grid don\\\\\\'t correspond to specific positions in the input. For instance, the output grid seems to be immune to rotations or mirror reflections of the input.\\\\n21. The input grid is scanned and if it encounters a blue or a green point, it plots a point of color green on the output grid. If it encounters a red point, it plots a point of color red. All other points are considered as black.   After initial plotting, the entire grid is divided into 5 horizontal sections and 3 vertical sections, creating a 5x3 grid. Each section represents a point in the output grid. The color of output point is determined by the color with the most points in that section. If there is a tie between red and green, green takes precedence. If there are no red or green points, the output point is black.\\\\n22. To make the output, you have to identify the color that is clone of the other one in the first half and replace it with yellow. Then combine the grids into one. If a cell is black and the cell in the other grid is not black, then replace it. If the cell is yellow, then change it to green.\\\\n23. To make the output, you should check the center of each 10x10 square (It\\\\\\'s the 5x5 center of the 10x10 mini-grid). If there are more red (2) squares than any other colors, make the corresponding grid square in the output green (3). If there are more grey (4) squares than any other colors, make the corresponding grid square in the output yellow (4). If there are equally most frequent colors or all squares are black, make the corresponding grid square in the output black (0).\\\\n24. The transformation involves dividing the input grid into partitions of equal size (10x10) and mapping each partition onto a single cell in the output grid. If a partition has more \"1\" cells, map it to a \"4\" cell in the output. If a partition has more \"2\" cells, map it to \"0\". If neither \"1\" nor \"2\" cells are present, still map it to \"0\". Hence, greater concentration of blue cells causes the corresponding output cell to be yellow, and greater concentration of red cells causes the output cell to be black.\\\\n25. To make the output, you have to first identify the quadrant with the red circle in the input grid. Then, you have to change its color to green in the output. You then fill the first column and row of cells corresponding to the quadrant in the output with green as well and leave the rest black.\\\\n26. Create the output grid by following these steps: 1. The top and bottom rows of the output should be mirrors of each other. If there are blue points in the upper half of the input, place a green point in the corresponding position in the top row of the output, and likewise for the bottom row. 2. The middle row of the output should have a green point for each blue point in the middle row of the input, and nothing for each grey point or black square in the middle row of the input. 3. For each column of the output that doesn\\\\\\'t have a green point yet, if there are any grey points in the corresponding column of the input, place a purple point. 4. All remaining points in the output should be black.\\\\n27. To create the output, form a region including the middle rows from one blue spot to another in a column. Analyze the regions for their dominant color. The output grid should represent these regions:  - If a region is mostly black with some blue spots, map it as black in the output grid. - If a region is mostly red with some blue spots, map it as blue in the output grid. - If a region has green pixels, map it as green in the output grid. Count the green spots in a region as being more dominant than black or red spots.  Look from the top to the bottom and map the regions to the output grid in the same order.\\\\n28. To make the output, you have to divide the input grid into 3 equally sized sections vertically. First section forms the top of the optional output and the remaining two sections form the 2 bottom sections. For each section, if there are more red cells than blue cells, then the corresponding section in the output would be green. If there are more blue cells than red cells, then the corresponding section in the output would be black.\\\\n29. To make the output, you have to determine the most common color that appears in the corners of the input grid (blue, red, yellow, or gray), excluding black. This color will replace the black squares in the output grid. The remaining color that is least common will replace the corners of the output grid. The center square of the output grid is determined by the 4 squares in the middle of the input grid. If yellow (4 value) is the most common color, the center square will be replaced by green. If not, then it will be replaced by red.\\\\n30. To make the output, the majority color in each quadrant and the center square of the input are taken and then placed in the corresponding location in the output. The top left quadrant color goes to the top left of the output (and so on for each quadrant), and the center square color goes to the center of the output. Majority color is determined by color that has the most number of squares within a specific area. In the event of a tie, priority is yellow then red, then blue.\\\\n31. To generate the output, you need to look at the groups of colored cells in the input. These groups are generally formed by vertical or horizontal lines, some of which intersect. You then map these lines to the output in a 5x3 space. If the line is blue, it transforms to green in the output. If the line is red or gray, it transforms to black in the output. Ignore any other color or empty cells in the input whereas, rest of the output cells should be filled in with black.\\\\n32. To make the output, you have to identify the largest shape created by magenta dots in the input and replace the pixels with brown pixels in the output. If there\\\\\\'s no magenta pixel, replace the output pixel with a black one. Gray pixels in the input should become white in the output and blue pixels in the input should become black in the output.\\\\n33. The transformation from the input to the output is to create a 5x3 grid where each cell corresponds to one of the 5 parts of the input. Color the cell orange if there is at least one blue cell in the corresponding part of the input, color the cell green if there is a green cell in the corresponding part of the input, and color the cell black if there are no colored cells in the corresponding part of the input.\\\\n34. To create the output, count the instances of blue, dark green, and green in each sector (top, middle, bottom). If all three cells are blue, fill the corresponding sector in the output with blue. If all three cells are green, fill the corresponding sector in the output with green. If two cells are blue and one is green or all three cells are different colors, fill the corresponding sector with dark green. If all three cells are dark green, leave the corresponding sector empty (black).\\\\n35. To make the output, you have to shrink the input cell by counting the number of non-zero cells in each 6x10 block of the input and represent them as a single cell in the output with the following mapping: if there are more blue cells, the output cell will be brown, if there are more green cells, the output cell will be purple, and if there are more grey cells, the output cell will be black.\\\\n36. To make the output, you have to shrink the input to a 3x3 grid by dividing it into 9 equal sections. If there are any blue cells in a section, make the corresponding output cell blue. If there are no blue cells, make the output cell black. If there are any red cells, make the corresponding output cell red, unless there is a blue cell in which case leave it as blue.\\\\n37. To make the output, you have to focus on the green squares and count the number of green squares surrounded by exactly three blue squares. This process should be applied on the entire 4x4 windows of the grid and should slide the window in the right direction until you reach the end of the row, then move the window down and continue from the left. For each of these 4x4 windows, if the count equals 4, then the center square of the current window in the output grid should be 4 else it should be 0.\\\\n38. To make the output, you have to  reduce the size by dividing the squares in 10x10 sections and mapping them into a single cell in the output. Black grid is mapped to a black cell. If a section includes a turquoise square, then map to white. If a section includes grey and blue squares , then map to red. If a section includes grey, blue, and white squares, then map to green.\\\\n39. To make the output, first, divide the input grid into 10 equal parts with 10x10 dimension. Each part represents a cell in the output grid. Then, assign a value to each part using these rules: - If a part contains more green (value 3) dots than other colors, set the corresponding cell on the output grid to green (value 3) - If a part contains more blue (value 1) dots than other colors, set the corresponding cell on the output grid to blue (value 1) - If a part contains more grey (value 2) dots than other colors, set the corresponding cell on the output grid to grey (value 2) - If a part does not contain any dots, set the corresponding cell on the output grid to black (value 0).\\\\n40. To make the output, you have to translate the colors proportional to the original grid into the output grid by following these steps: map each grey pixel to a black pixel, map each red pixel to a green pixel, and map the green pixel to a red pixel. Then, scale down the transformation to fit into a 5x3 grid by only taking the larger structure into account and averaging the pixel values.\\\\n41. The rules to transform the grid are simple. Each part of the output grid corresponds to a certain region of the input grid. If there are more green points than other colors in that region, the corresponding part in output grid will be green, if more red, it will be red, and if more blue, it will be blue. Finally, if none of the colors dominates that region, it will be black.\\\\n42. The transformation follows a general rule: If the pixel is colored on two of the three parts of the input grid (top, middle, bottom), then the corresponding pixel on the output grid is colored with the color 4. In the case when the pixel is colored only in one of the three parts, then the corresponding pixel on the output grid is not colored/black(0).   The position of the colored pixels in the output grid is identical to the position of the colored pixels in each of the three parts of the input grid. This transformation can be achieved by overlaying the top, middle and bottom part of the input grid and then applying the coloring rule stated above for each pixel.\\\\n43. To transform the input grid into the output grid: 1. Draw the smallest possible rectangle around the blue cells, while including them, on the input matrix.  2. Convert all inside cells of this rectangle to red except for cells already having blue color. 3. Similarly, for each distinct connectivity component of yellow cells, draw smallest possible rectangle while including all the yellow cells of that connectivity component. Convert these inside cells of the rectangle to red, preserving the yellow cells. 4. Shrink this modified input matrix with the same ratio to make it of size 3x3. If during this shrinking process, a majority of cells in a new cell is red, then that new cell will be red, if a majority is blue, new cell will be blue, and similarly for yellow. If it\\\\\\'s a tie between red and any other color, color the new cell red; If it\\\\\\'s a tie between blue and yellow, color the new cell blue. 5. The resulting grid after performing the actions listed above will be your output grid.\\\\n44. The middle section of the input is studied, and wherever a red cell appears, transform it into a green cell in the output grid. If a cell equivalent to a red cell in the middle section appears in both the top and the bottom sections, also transform it into a green cell. All other cells should remain as black cells.\\\\n45. To make the output, it involves multiple transformations. First, compress the top and bottom halves of the input grid into one, so that every matching position from top and bottom become a stack of two colors, with the color from the upper-half on top.  If the position only contains black squares, it remains black.   If the top color is blue and the bottom color is black, make the output square black. If the top color is black and the bottom color is red, make the output square yellow. If the top color is blue and the bottom color is red, make the output square green.  If the top color and bottom color are both red or blue, make the output square yellow.\\\\n46. The transformation involves identifying specific colourful patterns in the input grid and mapping them to respective numbers in the output grid.  Firstly, isolate the coordinates of each non-black cell in the input grid within the specific pattern it forms. The patterns are,  - A diagonal bisecting the grid from top left to bottom right, represented by red (2s) and blue (1s) alternatively. This diagonal forms the left and top edge of a square whose remaining edges are formed by yellow (4s). - 3 squares of 2x2 size in the main diagonal besides the right edge formed by yellow (4s), and red (2s) forming a vertical line besides the left edge. - 4 red (2s) squares of 3x3 size.  To make output, the following transformations are needed,  - The yellow (4s) diagonal and squares are represented as 4s in the output. - The remaining cells get their value by count of the red (2s) squares of size 3x3 in the corresponding quadrant of the input grid. - The output grid cells corresponding to the quadrant\\\\n47. Draw a boundary box around each colored pattern - blue and green, separately. For all cells that are within each boundary box, transform the cells in this way: - All the black cells should be painted as black - All the colored cells other than the central color (orange for blue pattern, green for green pattern) should be changed to brown - The central color cell (orange for blue pattern, green for green pattern) should be changed to green.\\\\n48. The transformation pattern is as follows. For each row, the most frequent non-black color is determined. The blue (1), yellow (4), and red (2) dots are replaced by maroon (3). If there are no colored dots in the row, it is filled with black. If two or more non-black colors are equally frequent, priority is given to blue, then yellow, then red. So, for instance, if blue and yellow are both most frequent, blue is chosen.\\\\n49. To make the output, you should count the total number of blocks for each color (blue=1, red=2, yellow=4) in the input grid, then divide each value by 4 (rounding to the nearest whole number). The output grid should fill from top row to the bottom row with references based on the order of colors specified (blue, red, yellow). The middle row should be filled first from left to right, followed by the top row and the bottom row. Fill the grid with the corresponding cells until no more cells left or grid filled. Empty cells should be left black (zero value).\\\\n50. The grid transformation involves counting the amount of blue (1), red (2), and grey (5) dots in each quadrant of the input grid. If the count of reds is higher than the count of blues and greys, the corresponding quadrant of the output transforms to a purple square (4). If not, the quadrant remains black (0). The bottom left quadrant of the output is always purple, regardless of the counts in the corresponding quadrant of the input.\\\\n51. To make the output, you have to take the lighter blue square in the middle of the dark blue crosses and make an output pixel green for each lighter blue square. If there is a dark blue cross without the lighter blue square in the middle, simply make the output pixel black.    A simple way to envisage this transformation is by dividing the input grid into 5 horizontal bands of 6x30 each. In each of the bands, convert the location of the lighter blue squares into green pixels on the output grid, starting from the top band. If there is a lower blue square without a lighter blue square in its center in the same band, place a black pixel on the column of that band in the output grid.\\\\n52. The transformation pattern involves counting the number of dots of the same type and mapping them to a 5x3 grid (representation of a die/dice layout). In the transformation, 1 (blue) to 3 (orange), 2 (red) to 4 (green), and 5 (grey) for unoccupied (black) spaces are mapped. Please note the mapping could variate, the main pattern, however, is represented by the number of dots in the clusters and the color of these dots changes to a new color in the output grid.\\\\n53. To transform the input grid to the output grid, the three types of colored dots are divided into three sections regardless of their placement in the input grid. Blue dots are transformed to a larger blue dot in the middle of the output grid. The green dots are transformed to a larger green line in the middle of the output grid with the red line below it. The red dots are transformed to two larger red lines that are above and below the green line on the output grid. Lastly, all black cells remain black cells in the output grid.\\\\n54. To make the output, you have to draw a 5x3 grid that encloses the center of the input. Then, you should replace the existing colors in this 5x3 grid as follows: green becomes black, blue becomes green, and red becomes brown. The remaining black squares stay the same.\\\\n55. To make the output, you have to count the occurrence of each color (excluding the black) that exists in the corresponding areas of the input grid. If red has the highest count in an area, the output cell should be yellow. If blue and gray have equal counts and are higher than red\\\\\\'s count, the output cell should be green. If black cells are the only ones present in an area, the output cell should be black. The entire grid is divided into 5x3 areas to do this operation.\\\\n56. To make the output, the rule revolves around the three spaces filled by a 2 (Blue color) among the closest 8 surrounding the 4 (Yellow color) and the space filled by 4 is part of the output.           So, for each 4 in the input,the corresponding cell in the output grid will be:  Filled with 3 (Green color), if exactly three out of the eight neighboring cells in the input grid are filled with 2;   Filled with 4 , if exactly four out of eight neighboring cells  are filled with 2;  Filled with 0 (Black color) otherwise.  The output could be seen as the 3x3 center of all the 9x9 grid, in which there\\\\\\'s the 4x4 Yellow (4) Square.\\\\n57. To make the output, take note of the five patches of red in the input around the middle of the grid. Map these five patches to the five cells in the output grid where there should be colour. If the red patch is surrounded by black cells, i.e. not touching any grey or white spots, it should transform into white. If the red patch is adjacent to one or more white or grey spots, it should transform into green. The rest of the cells in the output should be black.\\\\n58. In the output grid, the size of each square is directly propotional to the size of corresponding square in the input grid. 3 represents the largest square in the input and is represented by number 3 in the output, 2 represents the second largest square in the input and is represented by number 4 in the output, 1 represents the third largest square in the input and is represented by number 1 in the output and finally 0 represents the smallest square in the input and is represented by number 0 in the output.\\\\n59. To make the output, you have to compare the count of blue, red, and yellow cells in the input grid. If the blue \"1\" appears more often than the red \"2\" and yellow \"4\", fill in the corresponding cell in the 5x3 output grid with blue. If the red \"2\" appears more often than blue \"1\" and yellow \"4\", fill in the corresponding cell with red. If the yellow \"4\" appears more often than the blue \"1\" and red \"2\", fill in the corresponding cell with yellow. If there is no colored cell at all, leave the corresponding cell in the output grid as black.\\\\n60. For transforming the grid, find the largest square in the input grid which includes blue pixels, and replace it with yellow pixels in the output grid. Then, find the largest rectangle including red pixels below the aforementioned square in the input, again replace it with yellow pixels in the output grid, making the boundary of the square and rectangle coincide with the top and bottom boundaries of the output grid. All other pixels in the output grid should be black.\\\\n61. To make the output, you have to count the number of red squares within the large green square in the input. If there are 4 or more red squares in the green square, fill the corresponding cell in the output with green, represented by digit 4. If there are less than 4 red squares, fill the corresponding cell with black (digit 0), with the exception of the two cells in the bottom row which should be filled with green regardless of the red square count.\\\\n62. To make the output, the transformation from the input grid to the output grid has a rule:  Firstly, we divide the input grid into 6x6 chunks.  Then for each chunk, we count the number of ones(blue color) and the number of twos(red color).  If the number of ones is strictly more than the number of twos, fill the corresponding cell in the output grid with 4(yellow color).  If the number of twos is strictly more than the number of ones or if they are equal(i.e. the number of ones is less than or equal to the number of twos), fill the corresponding cell in the output grid with 0(black color).  The process is repeated for each chunk to form the output grid.  Exception: If the total number of ones and twos is less than 10% of the total cells in chunk, consider that chunk as not having any ones or twos. So, for these chunks, always fill the corresponding cell in the output grid with 0.\\\\n63. To make the output, you have to divide the input grid into non-overlapping 6x10 sections and replace each section with a green cell in the 5x3 grid if the section contains more green cells than any other color, or with a red cell if the section contains more red cells than any other color. If neither condition is met, the cell should be black in the 5x3 output grid.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "Based on the similarities in the rules, they can be categorized into eight distinct categories as follows:\n\nCategory 1: Rules involving color transformation and scaling down\n1.

For each category, synthesize the rules into a single, specific rule that combines the ideas of all rules in that category, while clearly differentiating it from the other categories.\\\\nThe new rule should be as specific as possible, following the format of the given rules.\\\\nThe new rule should be applicable without any information from the original rules - i.e. it should be standalone.\\\\n\\\\nRules:\\\\n1. To create the output, you need to scan the 1st, 3rd quarters of the grid (from top to bottom) as well as the 2nd, 4th quarters of the grid (from top to bottom). If the color (excluding black) and the pattern (irrespective of rotation or reflection) within the 3x3 grid are the same in two quarters, the corresponding cell in the output should be blue. If the color and patterns within the 3x3 grid are different in any quarter, the corresponding output cell should be black.\\\\n2. To make the output, you have to examine the segments in the input. If blue squares outnumber red ones in both segments, populate the output with 4 blue squares succeeded by 1 black square. If red and blue squares are equal in number in both segments, populate the output with 2 blue squares succeeded by 3 black squares. If red squares outnumber blue ones in either of the segments, populate the output with 4 red squares succeeded by 1 black square.\\\\n3. To make the output, you have to count the number of quadrants that have the same 2x2 square and output a 1 in each position for each quadrant that matches. If none of the quadrants match, output a 0. Quadrants are matching if they have the same sequence of colors in the same positions.\\\\n4. To obtain the output, first, you need to check the top-left 2x2 grid without considering surrounding empty spaces in each subsection. If the 2x2 grid consists of red cells, then place a \\\\\\'1\\\\\\' in the corresponding location of the output grid, else place a \\\\\\'0\\\\\\' (when the 2x2 grid is blue). Assign these based on the subsection order from top-left to bottom-right (The top-left subdivision gives the first output cell, the top-right gives the second, the bottom-left gives the third, and the bottom-right gives the fourth). The 5th cell is always \\\\\\'0\\\\\\'. Finally, the output will be a 1x5 grid with blue cells representing \\\\\\'1\\\\\\' and black cells representing \\\\\\'0\\\\\\'.\\\\n5. To make the output, first divide the input grid into four quadrants. Then count the number of blue (1) and red (2) squares in each quadrant. For each quadrant, check if the number of blue squares is more than the number of red squares. If more blue squares are present, output a blue square in the corresponding position on the 1x5 grid. At the end, if all quadrants contained more blue squares, the output will be a line of blue squares, otherwise, the last square (rightmost) on the line will be black (0).\\\\n6. To get the output grid, you have to use the digit in the right bottom corner of the input grid. Draw a diagonal line (oriented from the bottom left to the top right) of this digit\\\\\\'s color through the middle. Then count the number of times this digit\\\\\\'s color appears on either side of the diagonal. In your output grid, place the resultant number in blue. If the two numbers are equal and the number on the diagonal is red, add a red square at the end of your blue ones. If the number on the diagonal is blue or black, don\\\\\\'t place a red square. Fill any remaining squares in the 1x5 grid with black squares.\\\\n7. To make the output, you have to start from the cell in the center of the grid and then go to the right, top, left, and bottom cell in that order; for each cell compare its color to the initial center cell\\\\\\'s color. If the color matches, put a blue cell in the output grid, otherwise put a black cell. This operation results in an output string of five cells where the center cell is always black as it represents the comparison of the center cell with itself.\\\\n8. The transformation involves counting the number of blue \\\\\\'1\\\\\\'s in each of the 4 quadrants. For each quadrant, if the quantity of blue \\\\\\'1\\\\\\'s is more than 2, the corresponding cell in the output turns blue, else it remains black. The output is a line where each cell represents a quadrant from the top left clockwise.\\\\n9. To make the output, you first have to divide the large grid into three smaller 3x3 grids. Then, compare the three small grids: if the two outer grids are the same and the middle one is different, place a \"1\" in the output; otherwise, place a \"0\". Repeat this process from left to right to fill the output grid.\\\\n10. To make the output, count the number of blue boxes in each of the four 3x3 squares. If the number of blue boxes is greater than red boxes for each 3x3 square then place a blue box in the output grid otherwise place a red box in the output grid. This process should be applied for each of the four 3x3 squares going from top-left, top-right, bottom-left to bottom-right. The last box in the output grid should be black.\\\\n11. Each of the four 3x3 squares in the corners of the grid can be assigned a value based on whether it contains more blue or red cells.  - Blue 3x3 squares are considered as 1. - Red 3x3 squares are considered as 0.  If a 3x3 square has equal numbers of blue and red cells, give it the value of the 3x3 square diagonally opposite to it in the entire 9x9 grid.  The output grid will then take the forms of these values from the corners in a clockwise sequence, starting from the top-left corner. The center cell in the output grid takes the value of the center 3x3 square of the input grid. If it contains equal numbers of blue and red cells, the middle cell of output grid will 0(black).\\\\n12. To make the output, you have to count the number of blue (1) and red (2) cells in each quadrant. The first and second number in the output grid would represent the count of blue cells in the first and second quadrant respectively. Similarly, the third and fourth number in the output grid would represent the count of red cells in the third and fourth quadrant respectively. The last number in the output grid is always black (0).\\\\n13. On examining the input, notice that there are 4 quadrants separated by black squares. Look at the squares in the top left and bottom right quadrant. If they are the same colour, give a score of 1. If they are different colours or both black, give a score of 0. Do the same for the squares in the top right and bottom left quadrant. Add the scores together for each corresponding spot in the quadrant and if the score is 2 then the corresponding square in the output is blue, if the score is less than 2 then the corresponding square in the output is black. The squares in the output map to the squares in the quadrant from top left to bottom right.\\\\n14. To make the output, you have to check each 3x3 square in the input grid from top left to bottom right in a clockwise manner. For each 3x3 square that contains at least one red box, output a blue box. If a 3x3 square does not contain any red boxes, output a black box.\\\\n15. To make the output, you should count the number of red and blue cells in the input grid and determine which one is more. Assign the bigger count of cells as 1, and the other as 0. These numbers are then placed in a single row, with the rightmost cell determined by the color (blue or red) of the center cell of the input grid. If the center cell of the input grid is blue or red, then this is represented by a 1 in the output grid, and if it is black, it is represented by a 0. If there is the same number of red and blue cells, assign 5 blue cells (1) to the output row.\\\\n16. To make the output, you have to count the number of 3x3 squares that contain more blue cells than red. This count is represented with blue cells in the output, from left to right. The remaining cells in the output are black.\\\\n17. To transform the grid you should first count the number of blue blocks from each individual 3x3 square from left to right and top to bottom. For each 3x3 square that has 3 or more blue blocks, make the corresponding output square blue. If there are less than 3 blue blocks, make the corresponding output square black. The output grid is a horizontal line that maps the results.\\\\n18. To make the output, you have to count the dots formed by blue and red blocks. If the color of the dots, from left to right, are in the order: Blue, Blue, Red, Blue, Blue, then the output grid should be [1,1,0,0,0]. If the order is: Blue, Blue, Blue, Blue, Red, then the output grid should be [1,1,1,1,0].\\\\n19. To make the output, you have to check the color sequences in the corners of the grid. The output is created based on the following rules:   1) If there is a majority of blue in the top left and bottom right corners, output a blue box (denoted by \\\\\\'1\\\\\\') in the first cell of output.  2) If there is a majority of blue in the top right and bottom left corners, output a blue box (denoted by \\\\\\'1\\\\\\') in the second cell of output.  3) If there is a majority of red in the top left and bottom right corners, output a blue box (denoted by \\\\\\'1\\\\\\') in the third cell of output.  4) If there is a majority of red in the top right and bottom left corners, output a blue box (denoted by \\\\\\'1\\\\\\') in the fourth cell of output.  5) If all four corners of the grid have an equal amount of blue and red, output a black box (denoted by \\\\\\'0\\\\\\') for the last cell of output. If\\\\n20. To make the output, you have to analyze the boxes in the input grid. For each quadrant, if the box in the quadrant is blue, put a \\\\\\'1\\\\\\' in the respective index in the output. If the box in the quadrant is red, put a \\\\\\'0\\\\\\' in the respective index in the output. Repeat this process for each quadrant starting from the top left, moving clockwise. If there isn\\\\\\'t a box in any of the quadrants, place a \\\\\\'0\\\\\\' in the respective index in the output.\\\\n21. To get the output, identify if the colored squares are in their initial positions. If so, output a blue square (1) in the corresponding position of the 1x5 grid (meaning position 1 corresponds to top left square, position 2 to top right, etc.). If the colored square switched positions with another square, output a black square (0).\\\\n22. The grid transformation process involves comparing the quantity of 1\\\\\\'s in all 9 sections (including the singular midsections at corners). For each section, if the number of 1\\\\\\'s is greater than the number of 2\\\\\\'s, then the corresponding cell in the output grid becomes 1(blue). But if the total number of 2\\\\\\'s (red) is greater than or equal to the total number of 1\\\\\\'s (blue), then the corresponding cell in the output grid becomes 0 (black).\\\\n23. To make the output, you need to compare the four 3x3 squares outlined on the corners. Pay attention to the color that appears in the center cell of each 3x3 square. Starting from the top left corner and moving clockwise, make the output cell blue if the center color in a 3x3 square appears in both neighboring squares, otherwise make it black. The fifth output cell is always black.\\\\n24. You have to count the number of non-zero blue and red squares in each quadrant defined by the large yellow square. Then, convert the count into binary. The numbers zero to four correspond to the binary digits 0000 to 0100, and are translated into the output grid. The blue squares count equates to two binary digits and the red squares count equates to the remaining two digits. If the squares count equates to 0, no color is displayed. If it equates to 1, green is displayed. The top left quadrant accounts for the first binary digit, the top right the second, the bottom right the third, and the bottom left the fourth.\\\\n25. To make the output, you have to count the squares of each color in the two 3x3 squares in the middle of the original grid. Then, for each color, from left to right, create a sequence of filled squares in the output row equal to the sum of the number of that color\\\\\\'s squares in the two central 3x3 squares. If there are no blue or red squares in these squares, then no squares of that color are drawn in the output row. After drawing the blue and red squares, fill in the remaining squares in the output row with black squares until you reach 5 columns.\\\\n26. To make the output, you have to compare the blues squares with the red squares. For each row in the grid, put 1 if there\\\\\\'s a majority of blue squares or 0 if there\\\\\\'s a majority of red squares. If equal, put 0.\\\\n27. Look at the border of the input grid. If there are four blue cells in the corners of the border, output four blue cells followed by one black cell. If there is at least one red cell in the corners of the border, output all blue cells in the output grid.\\\\n28. For each of the four outer black empty squares in the input grid, if they all contain a 2x2 red square that\\\\\\'s fully inside them, mark an \"on\" (representing with #1) in the correspondent position of the output grid. Otherwise mark \"off\" (representing with #0). The sequence is read clockwise from the top left square.\\\\n29. To make the output, you need to compare the quadrants by pairs (top left with bottom right, top right with bottom left). For each quadrant pair, if the pattern of blue and red squares in one matches the pattern in the other, place a blue square in the corresponding position in the output, and a black square in case it doesn\\\\\\'t.   The first output square compares the top left and bottom right quadrants, the second output square compares the second column\\\\\\'s of the top left and bottom right quadrants, the third output square compares the third column\\\\\\'s of the top left and bottom right quadrants, the fourth output square compares the third column\\\\\\'s of the top right and bottom left quadrants and the fifth output square compares the fourth column\\\\\\'s of the top right and bottom left quadrants.\\\\n30. Count the total number of each color present in the input grid. The output grid follows a rule \"2 1 2 1 0\" which represents the sequence of blue and red counts. If the sequence is satisfied in the input, fill the corresponding output cell with a \\\\\\'1\\\\\\'. If not, the output cell should be a \\\\\\'0\\\\\\'. For example in the last case, the sequence goes: blue, blue, red, red, blue, blue, red, red. Mapping it to the rule, we get 11210. As this is not the 21210 rule, the last cell in the output is a \\\\\\'0\\\\\\'.\\\\n31. To make the output, you need to create a line connecting the center of all red squares, and count the number of blue squares that this line passes through. For each blue square that the line passes through, place a blue square in the output from the left. The rest spaces are to be filled with black.\\\\n32. To make the output, you have to take the 9x9 grid and group them into 3x3 squares. Count the number of red (2) squares in each 3x3 grid. If the count of red squares is equal to or greater than 4, mark a red (2) square; otherwise, mark a blue (1) square. Do this for all 3x3 grids from top left to bottom right. Then, if any group has no red (2) blocks, replace it with a blue one. Thus, the output will be a single row with red or blue squares reflecting the count of red squares in each 3x3 grid.\\\\n33. To make the output, you need to check the pattern in the middle of each 3x3 input square. If there is a square of blue cells, place blue cell in the output. If there is a square of red cells, place red cell in the output. If no squares of same color are found, place black cell in output. The pattern checking order is from top left to bottom right, row by row.\\\\n34. To make the output, you have to count the number of 2x2 squares within each 4x4 square that are filled with more of the color of the respective 2x2 square in the middle of the entire grid. Each count corresponds to a box in the output. If the count matches the color in the center (blue boxes = 1, red boxes = 2), the box in the output is filled with blue, if it does not match it is filled with black.\\\\n35. To create the output, you need to count the number of times each of the two lines (one of 1\\\\\\'s and one of 2\\\\\\'s) intersect with each other. You should then map the count of intersections to the output grid. If there is an intersection, mark it with blue (1), if there is no intersection or they overlap entirely, mark it as black (0).\\\\n36. To make the output, you have to count the number of blue (1) and red (2) squares in each quadrant. Each quadrant corresponds to a position in the output grid in clockwise manner starting from top-left quadrant. If a quadrant contains more or equal number of blue squares than red ones, fill the corresponding output grid position with blue, else fill it with black (0). The central square of the input grid corresponds to the last position of the output grid, fill it with blue if it is blue, else fill it with black.\\\\n37. Count the number of times each color (blue and red) occurs throughout the entire input grid. If the count of that color is greater than 24, then put a representation \"1\" for that color in the output grid from left to right, blue comes first and then red. Then fill the rest of the blocks in the output grid with \"0\" until you have a 1x5 grid.\\\\n38. The output is created by analyzing each set of three rows in the input. Translating each set into a binary value where an overlap in blue and red gives a 1 and lack of overlap gives a 0. With each set of three rows resulting in a single binary digit in the output.\\\\n39. To make the output, disregard the middle row and square of the input grid. If, by disregarding the mentioned rows and columns, more than half of the remaining cells are red, output a grid of four blue cells and one black cell from left to right. Otherwise, output a grid of two blue cells and one black cell from left to right.\\\\n40. To make the output, you need to investigate the positions of the red and blue squares. If the red square is both above and to the left of the blue square, output four blue squares and one black square. If they do not meet this criteria, output four red squares and one black square.\\\\n41. To make the output, you have to verify if the squares at the corners and the middle of the grid match in terms of the color or no color(black). If all of the five squares (top left corner, top right corner, middle, botton left corner, and bottom right corner) have the same color (blue or red) replace them with the color blue in the output. If any one of the square is different among these , its color is represented in the output. The remaining places of the output are filled with black.\\\\n42. To make the output, identify the squares, each of 2x2 cells, in the input grid. Then,  record the upper left corner of each of such squares. After that, create a binary sequence (0s and 1s) where a binary number corresponds to each outlined square - the red squares are recorded as ones, and the blue squares as zeros. In cases where no square is outlined, record it as black (0).\\\\n43. To make the output, you have to count how many corners of the red squares are on a blue square and how many corners of the blue squares are on a red square in the input. Each counts towards the total number of green squares in the output. The rest of the boxes in the output grid should be filled with blue.\\\\n44. To make the output, count the number of 3x3 squares formed by each colored tiles from each corner. The color blue is denoted by 1, and the color red is denoted by 0. The count of blue squares in top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right corners forms the first four elements in the output row respectively. If there\\\\\\'s a 3x3 black square in the center of the input grid, the last element of the output row is 0, if not it is 1.\\\\n45. To create the output grid, start from the top left corner of the input grid. Keep moving right and then down, counting the squares of size 1x1, 1x2, 2x1 and 2x2. Only count those squares if they contain either all blues or reds, but not a mix of both. The first 4 squares of the 1x5 output grid will contain 1 (blue) or 0 if a square was encountered, the last square will contain 0. In simpler terms, if you find either a blue or a red 1x1, 1x2, 2x1 and 2x2 square count it as blue but stop counting after four and the fifth cell is always 0 or black.\\\\n46. To make the output, you have to count the number of blue (1) and red (2) individual square cells in the grid. The output will be a row with 5 cells. Fill the first number of cells equal to the number of blue squares with blue, and the rest with black (0).\\\\n47. To make the output, you should count the number of blue and red numbers in each quarter of the 4x4 square (top left, top right, bottom left, bottom right). If you see the same color in more than two quarters, then that means the color is dominant. Convert the dominant color into 1\\\\\\'s and the single blue or red number in the middle into 0\\\\\\'s in the 1x5 output grid. So, the output is a line where majority of the grid is of the dominant color of the input. The non-dominant color is represented at the 5th position in the output grid.\\\\n48. To make the output, you have to count red and blue squares in each of the four 3x3 areas, but take into account only the triangular areas - from top-left to bottom-right for the left top square, from top-right to the bottom-left for the right top square, from the bottom-left to top-right for the left bottom square and from bottom-right to top-left for the right bottom one. After each area has been processed, place the count of red squares in the output grid. If no red squares were found, place a blue square in the current spot in the output.\\\\n49. To make the output grid, count the quantity of large squares (2x2) of each color in the grid, start by looking at the top left quadrant, from top to bottom and then from left to right. For every Blue square,  indicate by 1 (One) and for each Red square indicate by 0(Zero). So the output is a 5 cells representing the count of Blue and Red squares.\\\\n50. To make the output, check the center square of each quadrant in clockwise order, starting from the top left quadrant. If the center square is colored, output a blue square, otherwise, output a black square.\\\\n51. To produce the output, you have to count the blue blocks in the top half, count the red blocks in the bottom half and compare them. If the number of blue blocks is more, the corresponding output cell should be blue (number 1). If the red blocks is more, then the corresponding output cell should be red (number 2). If they are equal, the cell should be black (number 0). Repeat this for each column.\\\\n52. To make the output, you have to count the number of red cells in each 3x3 square from left to right. In the output grid, each cell represents a separate 3x3 square. Color the cell red, if there are more red cells in the 3x3 square. Color the cell blue, if there are more blue cells in the 3x3 square. If there are the same number of red and blue cells, or if the square contains only black cells, color the cell black.\\\\n53. The transformation is determined by the color that appears in the diagonal of both of the two top 3x3 squares and both of the two bottom 3x3 squares in the input grid. Count the number of 3x3 squares (out of all four) where this color exists in top left and bottom right corner. Then, for the output grid, fill the number of top cells equivalent to that count with blue, and the rest of the cells with black.\\\\n54. To make the output, you have to match the pattern in the top left, top right, bottom left, and bottom right 3x3 squares. If all four squares match, assign a blue cell in the output grid, and if don\\\\\\'t match, assign a black cell. The output grid is filled from left to right following the sequence top-right square, top-left square, bottom-left square, bottom-right square of the input grid. The last cell in the output is always black.\\\\n55. To make the output, we have to count the number of small squares in the input which have the top left and bottom right corners filled with the same colors. It does matter if the color is black or some other color, as long as they are the same, we count it. After counting, fill the output row with blue squares equivalent to the count and leave the rest as black.\\\\n56. To transform the input grid to the corresponding output, first examine the three diagonal color squares, starting from the top left and moving to the bottom right of the grid. If the diagonal is predominantly red, output two blue squares. If the diagonal is predominantly blue, output two red squares. If the diagonal is predominantly black (or there are no color squares), output a black square.\\\\n57. To make the output, first count the number of blue cells in each of the four 4x4 squares (moving from top left clockwise). This forms a set of four numbers. For each pair of adjacent numbers in the set (including the last and first number as a pair), if both numbers are equal, place a blue cell in the output; otherwise, place a blue cell if the right number is greater, and a black cell if the left number is greater. Move from left to right for the output cells. Thus, the output grid is a sorted, color-coded representation of the numbers of blue cells in the four sectors of the input grid.\\\\n58. To make the output, count the number of high concentration of blue (number 1) square and low concentration (close to half) of red (number 2) square among the four squares, label this count as X. Then the first X cells of the output are blue and the rest are black.\\\\n59. To make the output, you have to count the number of units in the 9x9 grid that consist only of blue (1) cells. Put a \\\\\\'1\\\\\\' in the output for each of these. Then count the number of mixed blue and red units, and put a \\\\\\'0\\\\\\' in the output for each of these. Ignore the units that consist only of red cells or empty cells.\\\\n60. To make the output, you have to count the number of mirrored blue cells in the corresponding squares of the first and third row (or column), starting from the top left and moving to the right, mapping these counts from 1 to 4. Then, in the last cell of the output, put \\\\\\'0\\\\\\' if the center cell of the center 3x3 square is black, else put \\\\\\'2\\\\\\'.\\\\n61. To make the output, count the number of colored squares in each quadrant: if the top left quadrant has equal or more colored squares than the top right quadrant, and the bottom left quadrant has fewer colored squares than the bottom right quadrant, then it equals [1,1,1,1,0], otherwise it equals [1,1,0,0,0].\\\\n62. To make the output, count the amount of 2x2 squares in the input that are fully filled with the same color (either all blue or all red), and represent them as blue cells in the output. The fifth cell in the output should always be black.\\\\n63. In order to get the output, we need to totally examine the diagonal: from top-left to bottom-right corner. For each consecutive pair of cells along this diagonal, the cell to the left in the pair is counted as an 1 and the cell to right in the pair as a 0. Then, construct the output grid from the accumulated values starting from the top-left corner in a row-by-row way until the right-bottom corner of the output grid.\\\\n64. To make the output, find the colored boxes in 3X3 grid and compare the numbers of red boxes with boxes of blue. If red boxes are more than blue boxes, fill the output grid (1x5) with 1\\\\\\'s (blue color). If blue boxes are more than red boxes, fill the output grid (1x5) with 2\\\\\\'s (red color). If count of both colors boxes are equal, then fill the output grid (1x5) with 1\\\\\\'s (blue color) four times and fill the last cell with black cell.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "After analyzing the rules, they can be categorized into eight distinct categories based on their similarities:\n\n1.

For each category, synthesize the rules into a single, specific rule that combines the ideas of all rules in that category, while clearly differentiating it from the other categories.\\\\nThe new rule should be as specific as possible, following the format of the given rules.\\\\nThe new rule should be applicable without any information from the original rules - i.e. it should be standalone.\\\\n\\\\nRules:\\\\n1. To make the output, you have to take a green cell and move it in a counter clockwise direction until it hits the edge of the grid. Once a green cell reaches the edge, replace that cell with a teal cell on the edge and keep the original green cell in its original spot. This results in a grid that has few original green cells and some new teal cells on the edges of the grid along the path that the green cells would have taken if they moved in a counter clockwise direction.\\\\n2. To make the output, you have to replace some black blocks with teal ones. The position of the teal blocks is determined by drawing lines to connect the green blocks (when there are two green blocks present), or by its relative position to the green block (when there is only one green block present). If there is no green block, keep the original grid.\\\\n3. To make the output, you have to look at the locations of the green cells in the input. You then have to place a teal cell on the grid in the corresponding mirrored location along the main diagonal (from top left to bottom right). You should leave all other cells untouched. The green cells in the input should remain unchanged in the output.\\\\n4. To get from input to output, identify the green shape from the input. Then place a teal square (marked number 8) in the cell diagonally adjacent to each green square, there can be multiple teal squares for each green square. The diagonal direction is from upper right to lower left. If there\\\\\\'s a green square in the border and its diagonal cell lies out of grid, place teal square in the mirrored position. Leave all other cells black.\\\\n5. To arrive at the output grid, identify the green cells in the input grid. These cells denote the shape you need to work with. The pattern involves plotting a teal cell along the middle row and middle column for each green cell in the input grid.   However, follow a rule while placing the teal cells. If a green cell exists in the top-left quadrant of the grid, place a teal cell in the same row as the green on the center column (5th column from the left). Likewise, if a green cell exists in the bottom-right quadrant of the grid, place a teal cell in the same column as the green, but on the center row (5th row from the top).\\\\n6. To make the output, you need to draw a teal line from each green pixel in the input to the center. The line should have the length reaching half of the distance to the center. The direction of the line is determined by the quadrant in which the green pixel is located. If the green pixel is in the top-left quadrant, the line should go towards the bottom-right direction. If it\\\\\\'s in the top-right quadrant, the line should go towards bottom-left. If it\\\\\\'s in the bottom-right quadrant, the line should go towards top-left, and if it\\\\\\'s in the bottom-left quadrant, the line should go towards the top-right direction.\\\\n7. To make the output, you have to focus on the green points (number 3) on the input grid. Each green point will have a teal point (number 8) placed directly to its right in the output.\\\\n8. To make the output, you have to add teal cells on the locations that are mirrored horizontally and vertically with the green cell\\\\\\'s location, relative to the center of the grid. In cases where there are two mirrored green cells, only reflect the whole group.\\\\n9. To make the output, you trace a teal color path drawn from the top left to the bottom right of the grid. This includes three main steps:  1. Place a teal box in a row before the pattern of green boxes start. 2. Place a teal box in the column before where green box pattern appears. 3. Place a teal colour box in any row after the pattern of green boxes ends.  Remember to follow the specifics of each case and keep the original pattern of green boxes intact.\\\\n10. To make the output, you have to first locate the green dot in the input and then put a teal dot (represented by a number 8) in the row above, below and on the left side of the green dot, but not beyond the grid boundaries.\\\\n11. To make the output, you have to aim for the approach where the teal dots (number 8) are placed in diagonals on the black cells along the largest cross section of the grid, whose length is equivalent to the presence of green dots (number 3) in diagonals of the same cross section in the input grid. All other cells in the output grid remained black (number 0).\\\\n12. To make the output, you have to place the teal color cells to the left, right, top, and bottom of the center cell which is located in the same position in input and output grid. The center cell is mid-length to the left of any green cells or mid-height above any green cells in the grid.\\\\n13. To obtain the output from the input, a teal dot is placed in the center of the imaginary diagonal line that starts from the green dot to the right edge of the grid and the bottom edge of the grid. All other colored elements remain in place and the rest of the grid is filled with black spaces.\\\\n14. To make the output, you first draw the \"3\" box in the same place as the input. Afterward, put 8 at the corner of the 3 shape, on the 5th column. This means that the location of the 8 can be above, below, left, or right depending on the position of the 3 shape.\\\\n15. To make the output grid, you have to place teal (8) colored cells in the four symmetric locations connected to the original green cells through the grid diagonal (from bottom-left to top-right). For instance, if there is a green cell in the (4,4) position (count from 0), count 4 up from the bottom and 4 from the left and place the teal cell there.\\\\n16. To make the output, you have to rotate the positions of all the green cells in the input grid 180 degrees around the centre of the grid. After rotation, the green cells become teal in color. Do note that the center of the grid is not fixed at a particular cell but is at the intersection of the middle four cells in the input grid.\\\\n17. To make the output, you have to alter the outside of the green square. The outer perimeter that would create a 3x3 square around the green cells is what changes. The top left, middle and bottom right cells on this perimeter should turn teal.\\\\n18. To make the output, you have to draw a diagonal line of teal color starting from the corner green cell and extending towards the center of the grid.  To clarify the steps: 1. Find the green square which is closest to a corner but not on the edge. 2. From that square, draw a diagonal line with teal squares that heads towards the center of the image. 3. Ensure that the line ends one cell before the center.  4. Do not change any other squares.  5. Repeat this for all the green squares in the corners of the image. If there are multiple green squares in a corner, only take the one which is closest to the center of the image. This should create a pattern of teal lines heading towards the center from near the corners.\\\\n19. To transform from the input to the output grid, follow this pattern: - If a green cell is surrounded by 4 sides by black cells, then on the output grid, place a teal cell diagonally on the top right to the green cell. - If a green cell is surrounded by black cells on 3 sides (left, right, and top), replace the bottom cell with a teal cell. - If a green cell is surrounded by black cells on 3 sides (left, right, and bottom), replace the top cell with a teal cell. - The rest of the grid remains the same as the input.\\\\n20. To make the output, replace the top and bottom black square that is horizontally aligned with each green square with a teal square. Replace the black square to the left of each green square with a teal square. Do not make any other changes.\\\\n21. To create the output grid from the input, you need to focus on the locations of the green squares in the input. For every green square, place a teal square at the corresponding location in the output, rotated 90 degrees clockwise about the center of the grid. All other squares should remain black.\\\\n22. To make the output, add teal cells diagonally in line with the location(s) of the green cell(s) in the input grid. A teal cell is placed at the border for each green cell, aligned along the diagonal from the top left to the bottom right. If there is more than one green cell, the pattern is repeated for each cell.\\\\n23. To make the output, shift the green blocks to the left one square and replace the block where they used to be with a teal block. If the block is already on the edge, shift it down to the next row on the far right box and replace the block where it used to be with a teal block.\\\\n24. To make the output grid, you have to follow a rule based on the grid\\\\\\'s center point (X). If there are green cells in the input grid, add teal cells in the output grid at the symmetric positions relative to the center point.\\\\n25. To obtain the output, you maintain the position of the green cells, and add teal cells at three positions: the cell above the centre cell, the cell to the left of the centre cell, and the cell diagonally top right from the centre. If a green cell already exists in these positions, the teal cell is not added.\\\\n26. To make the output, you need to mark the cells that are on the intersecting line of the two green cells\\\\\\' rows and columns with teal. In other words, mark with teal, the cell(s) that would be in line with both the green cells if straight lines were drawn horizontally and vertically through them.\\\\n27. To make the output, you have to place a teal block in the middle of the green blocks. If there are an even number of spaces, the teal block should be placed closer to the top for vertical arrangements and closer to the left for horizontal arrangements. If there\\\\\\'s a single green block, the teal block should be placed below it.\\\\n28. To make the output, you have to keep the green diamond as it is and add teal corners. Each corner consists of a 2x2 square. The corners are located on the top left, top right, and bottom right sides of the diamonds.\\\\n29. To make the output, you have to create an axis mirroring the green markers. You should project a teal square beside each green square, perpendicular to the axis drawn by the rest of the green markers. The teal square should land on the black squares outside the green markers. If there is a green square in the way, the teal square does not appear.\\\\n30. To make the output, you have to place a teal cell in the midpoint of the space between any two green cells. The teal cell is always placed along the diagonal line connecting the two green cells. If there is only one green cell, place a teal cell halfway through the grid on the same diagonal line.\\\\n31. To make the output, you have to reflect the green cells on the positions (3,3),(4,4) to the position (2,5),(5,2) with teal cells (number 8). In other words, reflect the green spot within the pattern over the line connecting (2,5) and (5,2) (middle of grid), and color the reflect spot as teal (number 8).\\\\n32. To make the output, you have to surround the green shapes with teal squares. Place a teal square on the left of a vertically orientated green line and on the right of a horizontally orientated green line. Place a teal square above a vertically orientated green line and below a horizontally orientated green line.\\\\n33. To make the output, you have to look for the green cells in the input grid. If a green cell is located at any position, insert a teal cell at the symmetrical position along the vertical centerline. Leave all other cells black which are not part of the symmetry transformation.\\\\n34. To make the output, you have to find the green cells in the input. In the output, add a teal cell at the position that is diagonally to the left of each green cell. The original green cell still remain in the output. Move up from the first teal cell and add another teal cell if you encounter an edge before any other cell or if you encounter a black cell. Do the same but moving down from the second teal cell. The rest of the cells in the output should be the same as in the input.\\\\n35. To make the output, draw teal lines diagonally starting from the corners of the green cluster to the center of the grid. Form two sides of an invisible square and fill in the squares at these corners with teal. If there is no green cluster in the quad, the quad remains black.\\\\n36. To generate the output, you have to locate the green dot(s) in the input grid and place a teal dot with an offset of 2 cells up and 2 cells left. If the green dots are on the border and offset cannot be applied, drop the offset for that axis to -3.\\\\n37. To make the output, you have to find the green spots. Teal spots will be added in the output grid as diagonally mirrored over the center of the grid relative to the green spots in the input.\\\\n38. To make the output, look at the green cells in the input grid, then for each green cell, look at the cells to its top left, bottom left, and bottom right. If these cells were all black in the input, change the color of these cells to teal in the output. Leave the other cells the same as the input.\\\\n39. Find the center of the grid, referred to as point (c, r) where c is the column index and r is the row index. Identify the green squares in the grid and for each green square at (x, y), paint a new square at (2c - x, 2r - y) in teal. Leave all other squares as they are.\\\\n40. To make the output, you have to place a teal cell on the mid-point of the line formed by every two adjacent green cells in the input grid, in their row or column. If there\\\\\\'s only one green cell in a row or column, place a teal cell two spaces to the left of the green cell if possible, otherwise place a teal cell two spaces above it.\\\\n41. To make the output, you have to find the green cells (3) and draw straight lines of teal color (8) into cages creating around the middle point of the whole grid, until they hit a border or a different cell. The direction of the lines depends on the position of the green cells relative to the center. If the green cell is above the center, the line goes upwards. If it is below the center, the line goes downwards. And if it is on the left or right of the center, the line goes to the left or right respectively. Replace the black cells along those lines with teal cells (8), and leave other cells untouched.\\\\n42. To make the output, you have to look for each green spot in the input, and fill teal spots in each cell that lies midway between it and the center of the grid. The center of the grid is the position at the row and column index 5. Only fill the teal spot if the cell is currently black, do not overwrite a green spot.\\\\n43. To make the output, you have to draw lines connecting each green point on the edges of the horizontal bar of \\\\\\'A\\\\\\' with the tip of \\\\\\'A\\\\\\', and the connections should be made using teal color. Note that the original green points should remain unchanged.\\\\n44. To create the output, place a teal block above and below every horizontal pair of green blocks in the input. For any singular green blocks, place a teal block to the right. If a green block is on the right edge, instead place the teal block to its left. Do not change the position of any green blocks. All remaining blocks should be black.\\\\n45. To create the output, observe the position of the green cells, find the corresponding cell in the input located diagonally to the left, and mark that cell as 8 (corresponding to teal) in the output. If green cells are adjacent to each other in the input, apply the rule to each separately. If the cell position specified by the rule is outside the visible grid, ignore it. The rest of the cells should be filled with black (empty).\\\\n46. To make the output, you need to draw teal squares diagonally from each green square starting from the top left hand corner and moving towards the bottom right hand corner. Stop drawing teal squares once you reach a black cell. Then start another line of teal squares from the next green square you come across. This process is repeated until all green squares have been linked to teal squares. You should leave empty black cells where there are no green cells in the input and where no new teal cells are drawn in the output.\\\\n47. To make the output, you have to transform all black cells that are next to a green cell with two free spaces between them into teal cells. The direction can be to the left, right, up, or down.\\\\n48. To convert the input into output, identify the green cells in the input. For each green cell at position (i,j), place a teal cell in the output at the position (j,i), essentially transposing the positions of green cells. The other cells remain black.\\\\n49. To make the output, you have to find the green cells within the input grid, keep them in their places in the output grid along with their surrounding black cells. New teal cells will be added based on the following rules: If the green cell is on an odd numbered row then a teal cell will appear to its right. If the green cell is on an even numbered row then a teal cell will appear to its left. The rest of the grid will be black.\\\\n50. To make the output, you have to identify the midpoint of the green dots. If there is only one dot, it is the midpoint. If there are two dots, the midpoint is exactly between the two dots. If there are three dots, the midpoint is the location that maximizes the minimum distance to the dots. If there are four dots, the midpoint is the geometric center of the four dots. Then place a teal dot in the four corners of the square whose diagonal is from the midpoint to the corner of the grid.\\\\n51. To make the output, you have to place a teal dot in each empty spot corresponding to the center of the \\\\\\'cross\\\\\\' shape formed by the green dots if it exists. This cross shape is such that a green dot is in center and other green dots are exactly one cell below, above, left and right to it.\\\\n52. To make the output, you have to make a teal dot at the location that is centered on the green shape and touching the perimeter of the shape. For example, if the green shape is a single square, place a dot in the square right next to it. If the shape is a line of green squares, place the teal dot at the midpoint of it touching the side of the line. This is done by looking for the cell in the middle of the green shape, then placing the dot on its side closest to the center of the entire grid.\\\\n53. To make the output, you have to translate the green cells according to the following rules:  1) If a green cell is on the main diagonal (from the top left to the bottom right), place a teal cell two spaces above it (if it is not on the border of the grid). If there are empty cells above it on the main diagonal, put teal cells on those spaces. 2) If a green cell is on the counterdiagonal (from the top right to the bottom left), place a teal cell two spaces below it (if it is not on the border of the grid). If there are empty cells below it on the counterdiagonal, put teal cells on those spaces.  3) If the green cell is off the diagonals, place a teal cell two spaces to its left, if the space exist and it is a black cell. 4) If the cell is on the intersections of the diagonals, proceed with rules 1 and 2. If a teal cell was placed in a previous step,\\\\n54. To make the output, you have to find the green squares in the input. Then draw an imaginary cross (vertical and horizontal lines) across the entire grid passing through the green square. Replace the black squares at points where the imaginary cross intersects the boundary of the grid with a teal square. Note, if there are multiple green squares, each one will have its own imaginary cross and the points of intersection for all crosses should be considered.\\\\n55. To make the output, you have to position teal squares diagonally from top left to bottom right through the green squares from the input grid. If there is only one green square in the row or column, position the teal square on the middle row or column of the entire grid. The remainder grid remains black.\\\\n56. To make the output, you have to draw teal points surrounding each green point position in the shape of a chess knight move: two squares in any straight-line direction then one square in a perpendicular direction. If the output position was on the grid in the input, keep it the same. Any position outside of the original grid remains black.\\\\n57. To make the output, you have to identify the central green points and place four teal points on their diagonals (upper-left, upper-right, lower-left, lower-right). If there are two green points adjacent to each other in either a row or a column, place the two corresponding teal points adjacent to them in the same row or column, but skip the cell in between.\\\\n58. To make the output, you should add teal points in the grid in a diagonal direction relative to each green point. The teal point is added one cell to the right and two cells down from the green point. However, do not place a teal point if it would be located outside the grid.\\\\n59. To make the output, you have to locate the green points in the input grid and then place teal points in the output grid in the following manner: for each green point in the input grid - place a teal point one step above (if there\\\\\\'s a grid position above), one step to the left (if there\\\\\\'s a grid position to the left) and one step below diagonally to the right (if there\\\\\\'s a grid position below and to the right). If the green point exists and is present at the edge of the grid, place only the teal points that fall within the grid positions. Keep all the other points in the grid black.\\\\n60. To make the output, you should turn the black square into a teal square, located in the same row as a green square but in the column that\\\\\\'s symmetric to the green square\\\\\\'s column with respect to the center of the grid. In other words, reflect the position of each green square over the vertical center line of the grid, and place a teal square in the reflected position.\\\\n61. To make the output, you have to find the center, a point below the top green box where you would want to place the teal box. Find the distance from this center point to each green box. For each green box, place a teal box at the same distance but in the opposite direction from the center. If the center is in between two boxes, calculate the distance to both boxes and place the teal boxes accordingly. If there are multiple green boxes surrounding the center, place teal boxes around the center at the same distances but in the opposite directions.\\\\n62. The transformation works by reflecting the arrangement of the green cells along two axes, one vertical line through the middle column and one horizontal line through the middle row. These reflections are superimposed on the original grid, but colored as teal points instead of green. If no green cells are on the center horizontal or center vertical line, teal cells are added to these lines at positions reflecting the green cells relative to these axes.  For instance, if there is a green cell three rows above the center, one would place a teal cell three rows below the center; if a green cell is two columns left of the center, one would place a teal cell two columns right of the center.\\\\n63. To transform the input grid into the output, identify the green cells\\\\\\' pattern in the input. Then, place teal cells in the grid such that they span the \"width\" or \"length\" of the pattern, perpendicular to the direction of the pattern (if any). For diagonal pattern, teal cells are placed on row that is halfway between where the green pattern ends. If the green pattern is a block, teal cells surround the block on the upper and lower sides. You are essentially forming a \"mirror image\" of the green cells in the pattern, using the teal cells.\\\\n64. To make the output, you have to draw teal dots in any spot that is surrounded (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) by at least two green dots.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "Category 1: Rules involving movement or shifting of green cells\n- Rule 1\n- Rule 23\n- Rule 36\n- Rule 41\n- Rule 56\nCombined Rule: To make the output, identify the green cells in the input.

For each category, synthesize the rules into a single, specific rule that combines the ideas of all rules in that category, while clearly differentiating it from the other categories.\\\\nThe new rule should be as specific as possible, following the format of the given rules.\\\\nThe new rule should be applicable without any information from the original rules - i.e. it should be standalone.\\\\n\\\\nRules:\\\\n1. To form the output, remove the outermost horizontal lines of the input grid. Then, transfer any colored squares, excluding black and grey squares, from the removed line to the nearest remaining horizontal bar. Color the squares based on the color of the removed squares. Replace the first two grey squares from the left with the color of the first two colored squares in the vertical line, if they exist.\\\\n2. To make the output, you have to keep the frame of the pink squares and move the green square to the position of the colored square from the second line. You should also note that the newly placed green square replaces the pink square in that position.\\\\n3. To make the output, you have to take the three lines in the input, compress them by removing the black gaps, and line them up side by side to make the output.\\\\n4. To make the output, you have to transform the input grid in the following way: Start from the left-most column in the input grid and perform the following actions until you reach the right-most column:  - If the column is completely black (0), skip it and move to the next one. - If the column contains a streak color (colors that span from top to bottom), count how many streaks of the same color there are in the column and note down the color. - If the column contains a disk color (a single colored square in the middle of the column that doesn\\\\\\'t span from top to bottom), note down the color and move to the next streak color. - Move to the next column and repeat the previous steps.  This process will create a sequence of colored squares (1-9) for each row. Create an output grid based on these rows. If a streak color is followed by a disk color, replace the streak color with the disk color. In other words, the central disk color changes the color of its streak.\\\\n5. To make the output, you have to start by symbolizing black area/row in the input grid as the starting and ending point. After that, look into the middle row in the input and find where there is a color change. Mark these areas as the new beginning and end of your grid, then remove everything that falls outside. Keep the colors as they are.\\\\n6. To transform the grid, consider the colored cells at the very middle row in the middle section of the input. Perform the operation of removing the cells at the same columns where the colored cells appear in the middle section except for the blue cells on the far left and far right. The remaining colored cells in the middle row of the middle section in the input become blue cells in the bottom row of the output. The cells that were above these (now removed) colored cells in the input become the middle row of the output. The topmost row of the output is the same as the topmost row of the input, only it should have its width decreased to the output\\\\\\'s width.\\\\n7. Upon observation, you will get the output grid by eliminating the cells where the color is the same in the upper and the lower cell with respect to the middle cell in the input grid. Despite the operations, the center horizontal line, both upwards and downwards, remains unchanged. Also, within the middle row, replace the colored cells, which have the same colored cell either in the cell immediately above or below with a black cell. Otherwise, retain the cell color from the input grid.\\\\n8. To make the output, you have to remove the first and the last block of each row. Then replace middle gray block in the first row with the color of the block in the second row that is in the same column as the gray block. And replace the gray block in the second row with the color of the block in the first row that is in the same column. If there are blocks in the middle of either row that does not have a pair in the same column on the other side, replace them with black blocks.\\\\n9. To make the output, you have to keep only the squares from the top and bottom bands that are colored (not black) from the input. These colored squares retain their original color. You then make a new middle band based on the original bands. Compare the corresponding squares in the top and bottom bands. If both are black, the middle band square should be black;  if any one has a color, the middle band square should be colored with the color from the side where the color came from. If each band has different colors, the side with the last color square has precedence.\\\\n10. To make the output, you have to remove all the columns that only contain black or grey cells. The remaining grid becomes the output.\\\\n11. To make the output, begin by removing the first and the last columns from the input grid. Then, compare the corresponding squares from the top and bottom lines. If they both are grey, leave the corresponding square in the middle line as it is. If they are both black, change the corresponding square in the middle line to black. If one is grey and the other black, change the corresponding square in the middle line to red for an input blue (or vice versa), yellow for grey, and remove the squares corresponding to black.\\\\n12. Create the output by:  Step 1: Remove the first and last column of the grid.  Step 2: Starting from the top, each row in the grid should be filled from left to right as follows:  - If the cell was black (0), keep it black.    - If the cell was blue (1) and there were red cells (2) to the right or to the left, change it to red.    - If the cell was blue (1) and there were no red cells to the right or to the left, keep it blue.    - If the cell was any color other than blue or black, change it to that color.  This transformation includes the concepts of neighboring cell influence and color conversion.\\\\n13. To make the output, you have to iterate over the middle strip (gray strip) in the input grid from the second to second last columns. If the middle element is gray, copy the color of the element above it, if it exists, otherwise copy the color of the element below it. For non-gray elements, just copy them as they are.\\\\n14. To make the output, remove the first and last columns and the black squares surrounding the grey square in the input. Replace each row\\\\\\'s grey square in the output with the color that occurs the most in the original row (grey, blue, or orange). If there is a tie for the most frequent color, choose the color of the squares closest to the grey square in the input.\\\\n15. To make the output, you have to compare the position of colored cells (non-black or grey) in the middle row of the input grid. Then you copy the first and last line of the input grid in the output but only the positions that didn\\\\\\'t contain those cells in the middle row. Finally, copy the same sequence of the middle row without those cells sections as well.\\\\n16. The transformation pattern for the grid follows several rules. After cutting out the columns, the numbers 5 from the top and bottom rows of the input are turned into 2 in the output. The numbers in the middle row of the input grid are maintained in the output if they are not on the cut-off ends. If there is a number 5 in the middle row of the input and there are other values in the column other than 5, the number 5 is changed to the number found on the same row from the right side of middle row. If the number 5 inside the middle row is surrounded by zeros only, it keeps its own value in the output grid. The number 2 at both ends of the middle row in the input remain unchanged in the output.\\\\n17. To make the output, you have to eliminate all the columns of all black squares in the input grid. The colored squares remain the same as in the input.\\\\n18. To make the output, first identify the largest sequence of colored squares in Top-Down order which exists in the bottom and middle row of the input. Then, create a new middle row preserving the initial sequence of colored squares found in the input middle row. To create the bottom and top rows, locate the colored squares from the input\\\\\\'s top and bottom rows that were aligned with the initial sequence in the input middle row and use these to form the new top and bottom rows in the output. Fill any remaining spaces with black squares.\\\\n19. To get the output grid, firstly remove the row of gray cells. Then, in the remaining rows, remove the columns that contain a black cell.\\\\n20. To make the output, first ignore the first and last row and column of the input. Then for each cell in the input, if it\\\\\\'s a number 5, replace it with the number on the top row in the same column. If it\\\\\\'s not a number 5, keep it as it is. This rule transforms the highly variable multi-column input pattern into simpler output pattern.\\\\n21. The output grid is derived by removing all the \"5\" colored boxes and moving the corresponding boxes from row below up, in other words, pulling up the bottom row upwards while maintaining the order and sequence of the elements of the second row. Furthermore the \"0\" colored boxes that do not have a non-\"0\" colored box below them in the second row gets eliminated as well. The top row essentially becomes the new bottom row in the output grid while the middle row becomes the new top row with columns less by the number of \"5\" colored boxes.\\\\n22. To make the output, you need to remove the columns that contain the top and bottom colored lines from the original grid. The remaining columns are then shifted towards the center. Every row below the top colored line that is a repetition of an earlier box color gets replaced with that color. The rest of the row values remain unchanged.\\\\n23. To make the output, you have to first delete the middle row in the input grid, which removes the yellow line. Then, you shift the top and bottom pieces towards the centre of the grid. This results in the top row of colors overlapping with the bottom row of colors. The color in the overlapping squares should be the color of the upper square in the input.\\\\n24. To make the output, start by eliminating the empty row in the middle of the input grid. Next, remove the empty spaces on the edges of the remaining rows, compacting the numbers on each side of the top and bottom rows towards the center. Then, ignore the numbers 5 or obscure it with other numbers in the compacted top and bottom rows. In the end, your new grid should only include the affected numbers from the top and bottom rows, with all empty spaces removed.\\\\n25. To make the output, you have to condense the middle line of blue squares into a single column and add a column for each unique square color from the outer lines (ignoring blue squares) to the right of it. The order of these columns is from top to bottom in the input grid. Fill these columns with the respective colors. The black squares on the left and right of the grid should match the number of colored squares on the outer lines in the input grid.\\\\n26. To create the output, the 1st, 5th and 9th columns and rows of the input are removed. The resulting grid is the output.\\\\n27. To make the output, you have to remove all the black cells that are not within the triangle that has the gray cell corners. Then you need to remove all the black cells inside this triangle that are surrounded by the color cells of the top and bottom rows. The cells in between these colored cells will be filled with colors from top and bottom rows, if there is the same color cell in the top and bottom line, fill the cell with blue, if there is a different color, fill the cell with the color presenting on the bottom row.\\\\n28. To make the output, you need to take the colored cells from the middle row of the input grid and place them into the corresponding columns of the output grid. The first and third rows of the output should be the same as the first and third rows of the input after removing the zero columns.\\\\n29. To build the output grid, eliminate the entire middle row of the input along with any leading and trailing zeros in the remaining rows. For the sections of 5, replace it with a duplicate of the number that appears below or above them, respectively in the same column.\\\\n30. To perform the transformation, you should perform a row by row comparison starting and ending at the first and last appearance of blue respectively. The center part (with indices of the first blue to the last blue inclusive) is then copied to the corresponding output row. In this copied part, replace other colored cells by the corresponding cells in its middle row if it contains that color otherwise keep the cell as is.\\\\n31. To make the output, you have to follow these steps: 1. For the first and last row of the output, take the non-black elements of the middle row from the input and place them in the corresponding positions. 2. For the middle row of the output, take the first and last color from the first and last row of the input and make that the beginning and end of the middle row in the output, and fill the rest with the color that appears more times in the first and last row of the input. 3. Any black square from the input\\\\\\'s middle row will remain black in the output. 4. Eliminate black cells that are not between two non-black cells in the output\\\\\\'s middle row. 5. Rotate the entire output grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise.\\\\n32. To make the output, you have to remove the fourth and eight columns from the input. All grey squares in the first row are replaced with blue. Grey squares in the second row are replaced with the color in the seventh column of the respective input. Grey squares in the third row are replaced with black squares.\\\\n33. The grid transforms according to the presence of colors in each row. For grey lines, the entire row in the output retains the same color (red). For light blue lines, the color of each cell in the output depends on the equivalent cell in the input and its neighboring cells from the previous and next column. If the cell in the input grid is light blue, the cell in the output will be the color from the neighboring column on the left. If the cell in the input grid is red, the cell in output will have the color from the neighbouring cell on the right. Then, remove the first and last column in the grid.\\\\n34. To make the output, you have to use the color that appears twice in the input grid middle line and replace the grey color squares in the output grid with that color, keeping the pattern of the middle line. Make sure to exclude the black outer columns in the output\\\\\\'s top and bottom rows.\\\\n35. To make the output, you have to remove the black squares that are not part of the horizontal lines. Then, clearly split the grid in half vertically down the centre (ignoring the yellow squares from the split). After this, remove the right half of the grid and eliminate all yellow squares from the grid.\\\\n36. To make the output, you have to remove the rows containing the outermost 5\\\\\\'s in the middle row from each row. Then delete the first and last columns.\\\\n37. To create the output, a horizontal stripe is removed from the top and the bottom of the input grid. Additionally, the vertical stripes on the leftmost and rightmost sides of the grid are also removed. The colors in the center of the grid are preserved, and the border of the grid is marked with the color of the lower side line on the input grid. All cells in the output grid that share the color of the removed stripes in the input grid take the color of the bottom stripe. The rest of the output grid becomes black.\\\\n38. To make the output: - Copy the colors in the top and bottom stripes to their respective positions in the output. - For the middle stripe in the output, copy the color of the middle stripe in the input if there is no color in the corresponding position in the top and bottom stripe. If there are one or more colors in the top and bottom stripe, copy the rightmost color among these colors to the corresponding position in the middle stripe of the output.\\\\n39. To create the output grid, remove the black border from the input grid. Then, for the remaining part of the grid, observe each column from the input grid. If the center cell of the column in the input grid is black, ignore that column. If it is a non-black (non-zero) cell, convert it to a column in the output grid, staying the same colors. Hence, the output grid is formed by the numbers in the non-black columns of the input grid.\\\\n40. To make the output, you have to compare the squares in the corresponding positions in the top and bottom row. If they match (both black or both color), copy the color from the middle row. If they do not match, copy the color from the square in the top row.\\\\n41. To make the output, you have to copy the top and bottom rows from the input exactly, removing blue boxes; there should be a gap where these were. For the middle row, remove the first and last red boxes and keep the middle section. Keep the pattern of red boxes, some colored boxes (grey, teal, yellow), and black boxes. The output grid should continue this pattern. Colors appearing in small groups in the middle of the output grid are the colors located to the right of the blue boxes in the input, missing out the first and last occurrences.\\\\n42. To make the output, Start by removing the leftmost and rightmost columns from the input. Then replace all the grey spaces in the input with black. In the middle row, if the color (i.e., non-grey) square in the input grid is blue, light green, or pink, replace it with red. If the non-grey color is orange, replace it with orange. For the non-grey color if it\\\\\\'s yellow or light blue, replace it with purple.\\\\n43. To make the output, you have to do several steps.   1) Remove the fifth column. 2) In the top line, replace the third and fourth cell color with the color of the second cell from the start and end of the middle line respectively. 3) In the middle line, change the color of the third and fourth cell with the color of the second cell from the start and end of the top line in the input grid. 4) Made all the cells in the bottom line black.\\\\n44. To create the output, the action should be to remove the border columns of black boxes and replace the colored boxes (apart from black) in the second row by the color that appears most frequently on their column, if there is a tie the color in the upper row is preferred.\\\\n45. To make the output, you have to remove the outside vertical edges with singleton colors from the middle row and match the width of the top row. If there is a color in the middle of the top row, this color takes the place of the color that was removed in the middle row.  If a color exists in both the top and the middle row, then replace the color in the middle row with the color from the top row. The bottom row is made all black cells.\\\\n46. To make the output, you have to first remove the first and last columns of the input grid. After this, you need to slide the cells in the middle row by two steps towards right. The corrresponding cells on color bars above and below the middle row remain in their position. A cell is moved from its position by one step towards left even if it results in an overlap unless there is an overlap from the middle row in the same cell. If there is an overlap, that cell is moved by one further step towards left. If two colors overlap, the color from the middle bar takes precedence. The cells on the positions from where numbers are moved are filled with black color.\\\\n47. To derive the output, you must first eliminate the outermost columns on the left and rightmost side of the input grid. The bottom row of the output grid will be all black boxes, and the top and middle rows will reflect the corresponding rows found in the input grid, but with the colored boxes in the center replaced by those on the far right of the input, maintaining the same colored line on the outskirts.\\\\n48. Divide every row of the grid into three sections; Initial color squares (color 1), middle white squares (color 0) and final color squares (color 2). If a section is absent, treat it as being filled with 0s. Remove the middle white squares sections of each row. Replace the remaining color 5 squares in the first and third sections with color 1 and 2 squares respectively. Then, Attach first and third section together by filling the void created in place of the middle white squares with color 2 squares. Clip any exceeded part on the left and right to make the output grid symmetrical in each row. The length of the each row in the output is equal to the length of longest row in the input grid after removal of middle white squares. Also, if there is just one color in the row, let the middle white squares be replaced by that color only.\\\\n49. To make the output, you have to look at each column of the grid and compare the colors of the squares. If the top square and the middle square are different colors then the output square should be the color of the middle square. If the middle square and the bottom square are different, then make the bottom output square the color of the middle square. If the top and the middle, or the middle and the bottom, have the same color, then keep that color in the output. Leave the black cells as black in the output as well. Additionally, remove the first and last column to get the output grid from the input grid.\\\\n50. In order to transform the grid, the fourth and eighth columns are removed. Other than that, the colors of the squares are retained.\\\\n51. To make the output, you have to 1. Remove the columns in the input grid that are entirely filled with empty/black cells. Essentially you retain only those columns that have at least one non-empty cell. We do not change the order of the remaining columns.  2. If a blue cell is found above a red cell in the same column, then change the blue cell to grey in the output grid. The rest of the cells remain the same in the output as in the input.\\\\n52. To make the output, you have to reconstruct the grid by removing the columns which have a blue cell. Remaining non-blue cells keep their original position.\\\\n53. To make the output, you have to look at three corresponding slots in the top, middle, and bottom rows in the input. If the top and bottom slots are the same color, copy that color to the middle slot of the output grid. If they are different colors, copy the color in the middle row of the input to the middle slot of the output grid. Only use the columns of the input if the middle slot has a non-zero value, and ignore the first, last and the slot with the color from the first and third rows in that column.\\\\n54. The transformation rule is as follows: Rows above and below the central line in the input grid contribute a colour to the analogous positions in the middle row in the output grid only if their colour matches the colour of the respective position on the central line on the input grid. If there\\\\\\'s no match, the position in the output grid would be black. The outer rows in the output grid should match the colour of the equivalent positions in the red and blue rows in the input grid.\\\\n55. To make the output, one needs to remove the first row and last column from the input grid. The next step is to follow the row-wise color rule where each row in the output corresponds to the respective row in the input.   In each row:  - If the cell in the input is grey, then the corresponding cell in the output becomes grey as well.  - If the cell in the input has a number other than grey or blue, it is considered as that number.  - If a blue cell is followed by another cell that is not grey or blue, the output cell under consideration should be the number that follows the blue cell in the input. If the number after the blue cell is another blue then the output should contain the number which appears after the consecutive blue numbers.   This process should be repeated for each individual row by ignoring grey cells at both ends.\\\\n56. To form the output, the cells in the first grid where there is a grey object, the corresponding cell in the second grid is colored black (0). If a cell in the second grid has a color not present in the corresponding cell of the first grid, it is assumed to be black in the first grid and thus the color in the second grid is copied to the output grid at the respective position. Additionally, for any color in the second grid that is also present in the first grid (aside from black and grey), that color\\\\\\'s value is kept in the output. It can also be said the transformation process involves overlaying the two colored grids on top of each other and applying a color-to-color mapping with priority for non-black and non-grey colors except when the color in the first grid is grey.\\\\n57. For each number in the middle row of the output grid, if the same location in the input grid\u2019s top and bottom row both contain a 5, the number stays the same. If the top row contains a 5 and the bottom row does not, replace the number with a 2. If the bottom row contains a 5 and the top does not, replace the number with an 8. If neither the top nor bottom rows contain a 5, replace the number with 0.\\\\n58. To make the output, remove the third column from left (index 2) and third from last (index -3) from the input grid to form the output grid.\\\\n59. To make the output, you have to remove the outside black cells and leave only the three middle lines. Then, for the pair of colored squares with the same vertical position (one from the top row and the other from the bottom row), if one is green (5) and the other is not, replace the green square with the color of the other square. If both are colored squares but none is green, replace both squares with black. Also, eliminate all black cells that are not dividing the horizontal lines of colored squares. Basically, it\\\\\\'s as if the colored squares on the two lines are mirroring themselves on the condition that there\\\\\\'s no green square. If there is a green square, it copies the color of its \"mirror\". If there\\\\\\'s no green square and they are not the same color, both become black.\\\\n60. To make the output, you have to perform some steps according to the following rules: Make a comparison between the colored cells of the top and bottom row. When in both rows, at the same position, there are colored cells, the output is green (number 3). When the colored cell appears only in the top row, the output is the color of that cell. When the colored cell appears only in the bottom row, the output is the color of the cells on the same column of the middle row. Keep the middle row as it is, except for the grey cells on both ends.\\\\n61. To make the output, you have to rotate the colored dot and its two surrounding red boxes 90 degrees clockwise. Then, remove the grey columns that do not have any colored dots. The column before and after the red box containing the colored dot remains the same. The color of the dot turns to either blue, yellow or fuchsia depending on the original color of the dot (blue for grey, yellow for lime, fuchsia for white).\\\\n62. For transformation, we first remove the outermost columns from either side. Next, we examine the grids. If the colored square from the top row matches with the bottom row at the same grid position, we color the corresponding grid in the middle row with its color, else we leave it black. The output grid is then the transformed middle row.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "After analyzing the rules, they can be categorized into eight distinct categories based on their similarities:\n\n1.

To make the output, you have to draw vertical lines to the top and bottom of the grid from the two colored cells (teal and orange). Then, draw a horizontal line between the two vertical lines. The part of this horizontal line that is within the two vertical lines should be colored red. The intersection points between the horizontal and vertical lines should be colored according to the color of the vertical line at the intersection point.\\\\n2. To make the output, you have to first create a vertical line from top to bottom where the teal cell is in the input and a horizontal line from left to right where the orange cell is in the input, using the corresponding colors. Then, where these lines intersect in the grid, draw a red cell. The rest of the cells should remain black.\\\\n3. To make the output, you have to turn the column with the teal cell into all teal, and the column with the orange cell into all orange. Then, replace the row that had the teal cell with teal except for the intersection with the orange column, which should be turned red. Do the same for the row that had the orange cell, but with orange and red. The rest of the grid remains black.\\\\n4. To make the output, you have to draw vertical lines through the grid from the position of the non-black colors in the input grid towards the opposite sides of the grid (top to bottom or bottom to top). These vertical lines should share the color of the non-black cells in the input grid. The intersection point of these vertical lines in the output grid should be filled in with a new color.\\\\n5. To transform the input into output, locate the rows where the color cells were in the input grid. The teal (8) cell will stretch across its whole row, creating a horizon, while the orange (7) cell will do the same creating another horizon. The teal cell will also occupy the column it sits on, creating a vertical stretch, similarly, the orange cell will do the same. Lastly, at the intersection point of the stretched orange and teal line, place a new cell represented by 2 (red).\\\\n6. To make the output, perform the following steps: 1. Draw a vertical line from the teal square through the entire grid, replacing the black squares with teal squares. 2. Draw a horizontal line from the orange square through the entire grid, replacing the black squares with orange squares. 3. Replace the intersection of the teal and orange lines with a red square. 4. Leave the rest of the squares as black.\\\\n7. You should generate teal and orange \\\\\\'rays\\\\\\' which originate from the positions of the teal and orange squares in the input and extend vertically and horizontally across the grid. These rays should intersect at a red square, if the teal and orange squares are not aligned either horizontally or vertically. If they are aligned, the rays would overlap and result in a line entirely of that color. The rest of the grid remains black.\\\\n8. To make the output, you would first draw two diagonal lines from the top left to bottom right and top right to bottom left through the position of the teal square. Repeat the same for orange block. Any squares which these lines cross, make it the specific color (teal or orange). The intersection square between the lines should be painted red. Keep other squares as they were.\\\\n9. To transform the input into output, you need to draw a vertical line through the teal dot and a horizontal line through the orange dot. The lines should cover the whole grid length in their respective directions. But where these lines intersect, change the color to red. The lines should be teal where they pass through the previous position of the teal element, and orange where they pass through the previous position of the orange element. The rest of the grid remains black.\\\\n10. To transform the input grid into the output, do the following:  1. Draw a vertical and a horizontal line through the teal cell, and another vertical and horizontal line through the orange cell. All cells that these lines pass through should be colored teal and orange respectively (but not the cell where the lines intersect). 2. The cell where the two lines intersect should be colored red 3. The color of the remaining cells does not change.\\\\n11. To make the output, you have to draw a teal line on the X axis and an orange line on the Y axis intersecting on the point where the teal dot was in the original input grid. Then, place a red dot where the lines intersect. If the orange and teal dots were vertically or horizontally aligned in the input grid, in the output the red dot should replace the orange or teal dots.\\\\n12. For transforming from input to output, find the index of the cells that aren\\\\\\'t black in the input grid. Draw vertical red lines straight through these two cells from top to bottom, and replace the cells on the two locations where the colored cells were in the input with green (number 3) on all lines. Vertically halfway in the grid, between the red columns, insert a horizontal fuschia line. The grid should now resemble a cross marking out the specific spots where colored cells were found in the input grid, with the cross intersect at the middle point.\\\\n13. To make the output, you have to create a vertical line of teal at the column where the teal cell is located in the input, and a vertical line of orange at the column where the orange cell is located in the input. You keep these lines uninterrupted, except at the row where the teal cell is located in the input, where you paint a horizontal line of teal. Do the same for the orange row. All other cells should be kept black. The intersection points of orange and teal lines should be changed to red.\\\\n14. To make the output, you have to draw a horizontal and vertical line through the colored points and fill in these lines with the color of the point. When the lines intersect, color the square as red.\\\\n15. To make the output, do the following steps:  1. Find the orange (7) and teal (8) squares in the input grid. 2. In the output grid, draw a vertical line from the top to the bottom through the column that contains the teal square. The squares on the line should be coloured teal (8), except for the one which intersects with the horizontal line that contains the orange square, which should be coloured red (2). 3. Repeat the same process, forming a horizontal line in the output grid through the row that contains the orange square. The squares on the line should be coloured orange (7), except for the one which intersects with the above-mentioned vertical line, which should be already coloured red (2). 4. The remaining squares in the output grid should be black (0).\\\\n16. To form the output grid, create vertical lines passing through the teal and orange cells. The column containing the teal cell should be filled with teal, except for the middle cell which should be red. Similarly, the column containing the orange cell is filled with orange, only the middle cell in this column should be red. The rest of the grid remains black.\\\\n17. To get the output from the input, you need to draw two colored lines going from the top to the bottom of the grid. The lines are drawn in the column of the existing colored pixels in the input (teal and orange) and the pixels before and after them are also colored with the same color in each line. An exception represents the column of the second colored pixel, where the pixels in the line are colored red (2) halfway down the grid instead of the original color.\\\\n18. To make the output, you have to draw vertical lines of teal and orange color from the initial position of these colors. The teal line is drawn with a pattern of four cells before an red one (placed in the 5th position), while the orange line has an red cell placed in the 4th position in the line. All other cells are filled with black color.\\\\n19. To make the output, you have to create two vertical lines where the colored squares in the input are located, running through the entire grid. The teal line runs top to bottom except the middle of the grid is red, and the orange line runs bottom to top, again with a red middle. Keep the rest of the grid black.\\\\n20. To make the output, you have to draw a line of the same color from the top to the bottom square. The line passes through the center of the grid from top square to the bottom square, and a line from the right to the left square. The line\\\\\\'s color should correspond to the color of square it originates from. The intersection of these lines should be red.\\\\n21. The transformation takes the position for both the colored points and extends them vertically to fill the grid. The vertical line formed by the teal color intersects with the one by the orange color which forms a red cell in the grid and the rest grid is black.\\\\n22. A line is drawn in the output going from the position of the teal cell to the orange cell, replacing the black cells on this path with teal ones. At the same time, a horizontal line of teal cells is drawn through the initial teal cell position, and a horizontal line of orange cells through the initial orange cell position in the output. Where these lines intersect, the existing cell color is replaced with a red cell.\\\\n23. To make the output,   1) Draw straight vertical lines downward from the teal and upward from the orange points until they hit each other or the edge of the frame.   2) In the completed line, change colors as if a mirror was present: the upper part for teal and the lower part for orange.  3) The intersection of the two lines should be colored red.  4) Copy the line pattern to the corresponding rows. For example, if the teal spot was in the third row from the top in the input, in the output, the third row from the top would contain the same pattern as the completed line. The same is true for the orange spot.\\\\n24. The transformation involves two steps. First, all the columns that have a teal square at the top, and the rows with an orange square at the end, are colored in teal and orange respectively, such that the colored columns and rows cross over at the original point of the teal square. Second, the point where the colored column and row intersect is colored red.\\\\n25. To transform the grid, identify the two non-black cells. Draw a vertical line through them, colored with the color of the cell that the line passes through. Then draw a horizontal line through them, with the color of the intersecting cell being left up to the colour that these vertical lines would intersect at (The colour will interchanged at the position of those two coloured points). This will form a cross. If the lines intersect inside the grid, color the intersecting cell red. If they intersect outside the grid, do not change the color of the intersecting cell.\\\\n26. To create the output from the input, first identify the rows with teal and orange spots. Then, fill the entire row with teal or orange, where the teal or orange spot was located. The row that contains teal would be replicated to the row just above. Similarly, the row that contains orange would be replicated to the row just below. In the middle of the teal and orange filled rows, draw a single horizontal line in red following the column position of the teal spot from top and orange spot from bottom. Similarly, draw a single vertical line in red following the row position of the orange spot from right and teal spot from left. This would form a cross of red spots at the intersection of teal and orange filled rows.\\\\n27. To make the output, you have to draw lines from top to bottom and from left to right that intersect at the orange point. These lines should be the color of the top point (teal). Similarly, draw lines from top to bottom and from left to right that intersect at the teal point. These lines should be the color of the bottom point (orange). The intersection of the orange and teal lines should be red.\\\\n28. To make the output, you have to draw a vertical line of teal boxes from the initial teal box until it meets the orange box. Similarly, draw a vertical line of orange boxes from the initial orange box until it meets the teal line. If the teal and orange line intersect, fill the intersecting box with red. The remaining boxes should be black.\\\\n29. Draw vertical lines down the grid in both colors i.e. teal and orange from the colored square to the top and bottom of the grid. In between those lines on the row with the square, replace the other colored squares with red squares. The teal line should go down from the teal square to the row with the orange square and also go up from the teal square to the top of the grid. The orange line should go up from the orange square to the row with the teal square and also go down from orange square to the bottom of the grid.\\\\n30. To make the output, perform the following steps -   1. Find the row of teal and orange dots and connect them drawing a vertical line with the color of the row where they are located. 2. Replace the row of the teal dot with teal color across the row and do the same for the orange dot with orange color. 3. At the intersection of teal and orange line place a red dot. 4. The remaining cells of the grid stays black.\\\\n31. To make the output, firstly, intersect a line from both colored points and fill the line with both colors where they intersect the line with red. Next, draw two other lines perpendicular to the first line from each colored point until they intersect any line and fill the lines with the corresponding color as the starting point. Fill the intersection of this line with the first line with a red color.\\\\n32. The transformation involves drawing vertical lines through the location of the teal and the orange pixel. The line that follows teal is a teal line, and the line that follows the orange pixel is orange. The line where both colors cross over should become red (2). Black areas remain the same.\\\\n33. To make the output, you have to find the rows with non-black cells and replace all black cells in that row with the color of the non-black cell. Then, for the column of the teal cell, replace all black with teal and similarly, replace all black with orange in the column of the orange cell. For the row and column intersection of the two colored non-black cells, place a red cell.\\\\n34. To make the output: 1. Draw a vertical line (value: teal) that is an extension of the teal cell from the top edge of the grid to the bottom edge. 2. Draw a horizontal line (value: orange) that is an extension of the orange cell from the left edge of the grid to the right edge. 3. The meeting point of two lines should be red. 4. If cells neither lie on the teal vertical line nor on the orange horizontal line, they remain black.\\\\n35. To make the output, the following steps are followed: The input grid is divided into three sections horizontally, based on the positions of the teal and orange squares. The colored squares extend vertically to fill the sections they are in. The sections bordered by the extended colored squares are filled with the corresponding colors, with a horizontal red line intersecting each section in the middle.\\\\n36. To transform the input grid into the output grid, you need to draw vertical lines through the teal and orange points in their respective colours. Next, find the midpoint of these two lines vertically. Draw a horizontal line in red colour through this midpoint. The remainder of the grid should be black.\\\\n37. To make the output, you have to follow the following steps: 1. Draw vertical lines pass through the teal and orange square.  2. Create a horizontal stripe in the middle of the grid that passes through the midway point of the vertical orange line. The stripe should be teal, with red at the midway point. 3. Create a vertical stripe at the far edges of the grid that passes through the midway point of the horizontal teal line. The stripe should be orange, with red at the midway point. 4. The intersecting points of the vertical lines and the horizontal teal line should be red. 5. The intersecting points of the horizontal line and the vertical orange line should be red. 6. The spots where the red intersect the orange or teal also should be tripled.\\\\n38. To make the output, you have to perform following steps: - Draw a vertical line along the column where the teal pixel is, and make it teal. - Draw another vertical line along the column where the orange pixel is, make it orange. - Draw a horizontal line along the row where the teal pixel is making all teal columns yellow. - Draw another horizontal line along the row where the orange pixel is again making all orange columns yellow. - Make the intersecting cell of orange and teal lines red.\\\\n39. To make the output, first find the rows where the teal and orange pixels were found in the input. Divide entire grid into two parts on these two rows.However, now the teal (8) and orange (7) pixels will fill the entire row but leave spaces if it exists where originally the other one was present and instead replace it with a resilient pixel whose color is red (number 2). And the rest of the grid remains black as in the input grid. This strategy appears to be \"expanding the colored pixel across its entire row, with the other color acting as a barrier where they intersect\".\\\\n40. To make the output, create horizontal lines from the coordinates of the teal and orange dots stretching from both ends of the grid. Then, place a red dot on the intersection of the teal and orange lines. Everything else remains black.\\\\n41. To make the output, start by finding the locations of the colored squares (teal and orange) in the input grid. These squares form a vertical line where the squares act as endpoints. Fill in the rest of the cells in the vertical axis with the color of the respective endpoint. If there is teal on top and orange at the bottom fill the middle line with red. If orange is both at top and bottom, fill the middle line with orange repeated. If teal is both top and bottom, fill the middle line with teal repeated. Fill in adjacent cells to the new vertical lines with teal if top row of the vertical line is teal and orange if the top row of the vertical line is orange. The resulting grid will have colored vertical lines where the endpoints of each line is the same color as the original colored squares in the input grid, surrounded by a grid of the repeated same color, with the middle line of a different color if the endpoints are different.\\\\n42. To make the output, you have to draw a vertical line from each colored dot (both the top green and the bottom orange), to fill the whole column where that dot is located. After that, draw a horizontal line that splits the whole grid into two halves. The upper part is drawn from the green dot and the bottom part is drawn from the orange dot. At the intersection of those lines, mark that cell as red.\\\\n43. To make the output, you have to draw a vertical line over the position where the teal cell is located and another vertical line where the orange cell is located. Then, draw a horizontal line across the grid where the teal cell is located. Similarly, draw another horizontal line where the orange cell is located. Fill the intersecting cell of the teal line and orange line with red. All other cells that are not on any line remain black.\\\\n44. To generate the output, follow the next steps: First, extend each of the colored cells vertically up to the boundary of grid so that a solid line forms. Then, draw a red box at the intersection of teal and orange lines. Templates for the formation of teal and orange vertical lines can be seen in both the 8th row and the 2nd column wherein the teal line forms on the left 4 columns of row 8 and orange line forms on the right 5 columns of row 8. The red box (or intersection) forms only within the 8th row and 2nd column.\\\\n45. Here are the steps to transform input grid into output grid: 1. Draw a horizontal line in teal through the row of the grid where the teal dot is located. 2. Draw a vertical line in yellow through the column of the grid where the yellow dot is located. 3. Where these lines intersect (excluding the intersection with their respective original dots), change the color to green. 4. Keep the rest of the grid as black. This creates a cross with the teal and yellow lines intersecting, with the intersection points marked in green.\\\\n46. To make the output, you have to create vertical lines in the color of the existing dots (teal and orange) throughout the grid. Those lines should pass through the original dot locations. The line with lower value takes the space if any of the lines cross another. Then, draw a horizontal red line passing through where the color lines intersect.\\\\n47. To make the output, you have to draw vertical lines passing through the colored squares, color these lines based on the color of the squares (The line passing through the teal square is teal and the line passing through the orange square is orange). Where the teal and orange line intersect change the color to red.\\\\n48. The transformation can be described as follows. All the cells along the same horizontal line as the teal pixel in the input become teal, and all cells along the same horizontal line as the orange pixel in the input become orange. A line of red pixels is then placed on the row directly halfway between the teal and orange rows, with the red pixels extending horizontally to the furthest point inhabited by either teal or red.\\\\n49. To transform the input grid to the output grid, you have to mark the rows containing teal and orange cells in corresponding colors. The two cells marking the intersection of these rows should be dyed red. Also, the rest of the cells should remain black.\\\\n50. To transform the grid, first find the rows which contain the teal and the orange cell. Then, fill those rows with their respective colors completely. Next, trace a path from the teal cell through the center of the grid to the orange cell. If the distance is even, this path is filled with red cells. If the distance is odd, swap the color for red and teal cell. The path should go horizontally first and then vertically. Other cells remain black.\\\\n51. To fill the output grid start by drawing a straight vertical line using the color of the top colored pixel (teal) and a line using the color of the bottom colored pixel (orange). Draw the teal line starting from the position of the teal pixel to the position of the orange pixel and do the same with an orange line in reverse. Then, using the last color you draw (either teal or orange), paint the entire horizontal row where the color ends. For the remaining spaces in the grid, copy the lines with the same color as in the row above. Finally, wherever the two colors intersect, change that point to red.\\\\n52. To make the output, you have to draw vertical lines from the colored spots until they reach the edge of the grid, using the color of the original spot. If the spots are on the same Y coordinate, connect them with a yellow line, if they are on the same X coordinate, connect them with a red line. In other cases, they stay as separate lines.\\\\n53. To make the output, draw a teal line in all vertical and horizontal directions from the teal pixel until it hits the border or the orange pixel. Any pixel where the teal and orange lines intersect, or any pixel that contains the orange pixel, should become red. All other pixels of the orange line should turn in to orange. Stay with black color if no color is reached with the teal color or orange color.\\\\n54. To make the output, you have to draw a vertical line through each of the colored squares, replacing the black squares with the color of the original square in the specific column. For the middle column, if two colors overlap, you need to use the color red (for overlapping teal and orange). The rest of the grid remains black.\\\\n55. To transform the input grid to the output grid, the pattern takes the input grid and draws a vertical line through the column of the teal cell and another vertical line through the column of the orange cell. It then fills the rows containing the teal and orange cells with the corresponding color, except for where the lines intersect, in which case the cells are red.\\\\n56. To make the output, you have to expand both the teal and orange squares until they meet. On meeting, they merge to form a vertical line. If the teal square is above the orange square, color the line yellow, otherwise, color the line brown. Replace all other cells that came in contact with the expanding squares with their respective colors (teal or orange). All other cells should remain black.\\\\n57. To make the output, you have to project two lines, one in teal color and one in orange color. The line in teal color stretches horizontally from the point where the teal dot is located and the line in orange color stretches vertically from the point where the orange dot is located. The intersection of teal and orange lines should be represented by a red dot. Other squares remain black.\\\\n58. To make the output, you have to draw a line of the same colour connecting the teal and orange dots. You then create a horizontal line of teal and a vertical line of orange that intersect at the teal dot if teal is on top of or to the left of orange; or at the orange dot if orange is on top of or to the left of teal. The intersection cell should colour brown.\\\\n59. Draw vertical lines from the blue cell down to the red cell, and from the red cell up to the blue cell, by replacing the black cells in their columns with the color of the respective cell. For the row that intersects the two lines, replace the whole row with blue cells, and only keep the intersecting points the original color. For the intersecting points, switch their positions. So, a blue cell on the intersection should become the bottom one and a red cell - the top one.\\\\n60. To make the output, you have to draw a vertical line passing through the teal point and a horizontal line passing through the orange point. The color of the line is same as the color of the point, and lines are 1 cell thick. The intersection point of two lines (if exists) should be made red. Rest of the grid remains black.\\\\n61. To make the output grid, follow the following steps. Draw two horizontal lines of teal and orange boxes in rows that reached the top and bottom orange box respectively. Then draw two vertical lines of teal and orange boxes in the farthest right and left non-black boxes of the input grid. Create a plus symbol using red boxes that intersect the teal and orange lines in the center of the grid. Fill the remainder of the grid with black boxes.\\\\n62. To make the output, you have to draw a vertical line in teal from the teal dot to the orange dot. Similarly, draw a horizontal line in orange from the orange dot to the teal dot. For the cells where these two lines intersect, color them red. All other cells remain black.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "After analyzing the rules, they can be categorized into eight distinct categories based on their similarities.

To create the output, observe the middle cell of the input grid. The color of the cell in the output grid matches the color of the middle cell in the input grid. If the middle cell is black in the input, then the cell in the output grid will be black too. The same applies for red (2) and orange (8).\\\\n2. To make the output, you have to find the color of the square at the intersection of the diagonal lines in the input (i.e., the center of the crossed lines) and fill the output square with that color.\\\\n3. To transform the grid, examine the band of squares running from the top left corner to the bottom right corner. If this diagonal band contains more teal squares than red, the output is a single teal square. If the diagonal contains more red squares than teal, the output is a single red square. If the numbers of teal and red squares are equal in the diagonal band, the output is a single black square.\\\\n4. To make the output, you need to identify the color of the square that is at the center of the grid. The output will be a 1x1 grid colored with the same color as the center square of the input grid.\\\\n5. To make the output, observe the pattern around the border of the grid. If red is the most common color, color the output square red. If teal is the most common color, color the output square teal. If the colors are equally represented, color the square black.\\\\n6. To form the output, you have to identify the color (either red or teal) that is diagonally oriented in the input grid starting from the top-left corner. The dominant diagonal color becomes the color of the output 1x1 grid. If red and teal are equally distributed diagonally, the output grid is black.\\\\n7. To make the output, you have to count the cells in the diagonal from top left to bottom right. If the majority of cells in the diagonal are teal, the output will be teal. If the majority of cells in the diagonal are red, the output will be red. If the majority of cells in the diagonal are black, the output will be black.\\\\n8. To make the output, you have to look at the diagonals from the top left to bottom right and from top right to bottom left. If they are same color, the output is that color. If they are different, the output is black.\\\\n9. To derive the output, you need to look at the center cell of the input grid. If it is a teal cell, the output will be a teal cell. If it is a black cell, the output will be a black cell. If it is a red cell, the output will depend on the cells around it. If there are more teal than red cells in the cells that are directly adjacent (not diagonal), the output will be a teal cell. If there are more red than teal cells, the output will be a red cell. If the number of red and teal cells around are equal, the output will be a black cell.\\\\n10. To make the output, you have to identify the color in middle of the grid . The color of middle box in the grid is the color of the output.\\\\n11. To make the output, you have to identify the color present in the diagonal from the top left to the bottom right of the input grid and fill the only cell of output grid with this color. The diagonal should be traced by considering the first cell, the cells symmetrically positioned from center and the last cell. If the diagonal takes more than one color, the black color should be ignored and the non-black color should be considered. If there\\'s no color on the diagonal other than black, the output should be black.\\\\n12. To make the output, you have to assess the content of the main diagonals (from top left to bottom right and from top right to bottom left) of the input. If the main diagonals contain equal amounts of red and teal, the output color is black. If teal outweighs red, the output color is teal. If red outweighs teal, the output color is red.\\\\n13. To make the output, you need to check the cells at the four corners of the input grid. The colored cell that is in all the corners is the cell that will be in the output grid. If the corners are not all the same color (ignoring black), the output is black.\\\\n14. To make the output, check for the color in the middle of the input grid. If the color at the center of the input grid is black, then the output is black, but if the color is red, then the output is teal, and vice versa.\\\\n15. To make the output, you have to check the north and south poles of the diamond structure. If the same color cell is present at the north and south poles of the diamond, then the output is that color; otherwise, the output is black. In this case, \\'north\\' and \\'south\\' are defined as the cells directly above and below the central cell, respectively.\\\\n16. To make the output, we need to carefully examine the figure made by the colored cells in the input grid. If the figure is symmetric with respect to the main diagonal, the output grid has a teal cell. If the figure is symmetric with respect to the anti-diagonal, the output grid has a black cell.\\\\n17. The transformation pattern seems to be determined by the color in the center cell of the input grid. The output is the same color as the center cell in the input. If the input grid has an even-numbered width and height, the center cell is the top-left of the four centermost cells.\\\\n18. To make the output, you have to identify the color of the diamond shape. The inner diamond color matches the output grid color. If there is no diamond shape of a color, then make the output black.\\\\n19. To make the output, look diagonally from the top left to bottom right of the grid. If more of these diagonal sequence boxes are filled with blue color then the output is a single blue box; instead, if more of these diagonal sequence filled with teal color then the output is a single teal box. If neither color dominates, the output box is black.\\\\n20. To make the output, you have to find the color of a cell that touches all other cells either by border or by corner. Black doesn\\'t count. The output will be the color of this cell. For instance, if this cell is teal, the output will be [[8]]. If this cell is red, the output will be [[2]].\\\\n21. To make the output, look at the L-shaped corners of the input grid; top left, top right, bottom left, and bottom right. If there are more red squares compare to teal squares in the corners, the output is red. If there are more teal squares compare to red squares, the output is teal. And if the number of red and teal squares are equal, the output is black.\\\\n22. To make the output, you have to consider the color of the cells in the corners. If the same color appears more than once, the output should be that color. If there are different colors in the corners, the output should be black.\\\\n23. To make the output, you have to count the number of teal and red squares in the input. If the number of teal squares is greater than the number of red squares, the output should be teal. If the number of red squares is greater, the output should be red. If the count is equal, the output should be black.\\\\n24. To make the output, count the number of teal blocks and the number of red blocks. The color of the output block depends on which of these colors is in the minority in the input. If there is a tie, make the output block black.\\\\n25. To make the output, you should identify the color of the block that appears at the center of the grid. This color would correspond to 0 (black), 2 (red), or 8 (teal).\\\\n26. To transform the grid, look at the corners of the grid. Specifically, focus on the color of the corner cells. If more than half of the corners are red, then turn the single cell in the output grid teal. If half or less than half of the corners are red, then turn the single cell in the output grid black.\\\\n27. To make the output, you have to check if the red(2) and teal(8) squares are mirroring each other over the central square, and if they are, make the output square teal(8). If they do not mirror each other, make the output square black(0). When checking for a mirror image, you should only consider the squares that are the same color (eg., only check red squares against red squares).\\\\n28. You need to identify the color of box that has the maximum representation on diagonals from the upper-left corner to lower-left corner and from the lower-right corner to upper-right corner. Then this color can be used to fill the output grid. For instance, if you find out there are 5 teal and 3 green boxes on both diagonals of the input grid, the output grid cell will be filled with teal - represented by 8 in the input-output transformation.\\\\n29. Every vertical and horizontal stripe starts from blue color and ends in red. If these segments are identical, then replace them with teal color block. If not, replace them with a black block. Take the output from one of these decisions and make it the single cell in the output grid.\\\\n30. To make the output, you have to find diagonal lines from the top left to the bottom right If the color is consistent on diagonal lines from the top left to the bottom right, the output will be that color. If not, the output will be black.\\\\n31. To create the output, you have to look at the diagonal cells from the top left to the bottom right in the input grid. If the majority of these diagonal cells are red (number 2), then the output should be black; otherwise, if the majority of these diagonal cells are teal (number 8), the output should be teal.\\\\n32. The output consists of the color present at the center cell of the input grid. The center cell is defined by finding the median index of both the rows and columns.\\\\n33. To make the output, you have to locate the central square in the input grid. If the central square in the middle is fuchsia, make the output fuchsia. If the central square in the middle is teal, make the output teal. The other squares don\\'t matter for the transformation.\\\\n34. To make the output, you have to examine the diagonals from the top left to the bottom right and top right to the bottom left. If both of these diagonals contain the same color, the output will be that color. If the diagonals do not match, the output will be black.\\\\n35. To make the output, you have to look at the distinct color in the middlemost square of the grid. If the grid is odd, look at the exact middle. If the grid is even, look at the cell in the lower right of the middle four cells. This middle color becomes the single cell in the output.\\\\n36. To make the output, you have to examine the input pattern. If the pattern of teal and red squares is horizontally symmetrical, the output will be teal (8). If the pattern is not symmetrical, the output will be black (0). This symmetry is not about the entire grid, but includes the colored squares only, black cells are ignored in calculating symmetry.\\\\n37. The transformation pattern involves focusing on the center square of the input grid. The output will be the color of the center square in the input grid.\\\\n38. To make the output, you have to check for the color of the center cell of the input grid. The center cell\\'s color is the output. If the input dimension is even and does not have a center cell, then you check the color of the cell on the top-left corner of the second half of the input grid. Its color is the output.\\\\n39. To make the output, identify the color of the tile that is located on the center of the grid in the input. If the input grid is not odd-sized, consider the bottom line and the right column as limits. Output the same color as the center tile from the input grid.\\\\n40. To make the output, you have to identify the color of the cell in the center of the grid. Then make the output grid a single cell of this color.\\\\n41. To make the output, you need to find the color that appears the third time in the first three squares of middle row in the input grid, and fill the output grid with this color. If there is no color appearing exactly three times, fill the output grid with black.\\\\n42. To create the output, you have to find the most frequent color in the diagonals from the top left to the bottom right corners and from the top right to the bottom left. The most common color in these diagonals is used to fill the single cell in the output. If the colors are equally common, black is used.\\\\n43. The output is determined by the colour (teal or red) that appears in the top left corner for the greater number of times. If the number of times teal and red appear in the top left corner is equal, the output will be black.\\\\n44. To get the output, first, identify the four corners of the input grid. In each corner, you will have a 2x2 area. Look at each of these four 2x2 areas and for each, count the number of teal and red cells. If the number of teal cells is greater than the red cells, mark that corner as teal, otherwise, mark as red. If at least 3 corners are of the same color in this new 2x2 color-coded grid, the output should be that color. If less than 3 corners match, the output should be black.\\\\n45. To make the output, you have to look for all the 2x2 squares formed by different colors in the input. If a colour, teal or red, makes two small squares that are diagonally opposite each other in a larger 2x2 square, color the output cell that color. If each color only forms one small square in a larger 2x2 square, leave the output cell as black.\\\\n46. To make the output, you have to evaluate the diagonal of the input grid from top left to bottom right. If majority of the cells on the diagonal are red, output single red cell. If majority of the cells on the diagonal are blue, output single blue cell. If both same, output teal cell.\\\\n47. To generate the output, examine the diagonal from the top left to the bottom right of the input grid. If the diagonal is filled with consecutive teal or red spots, then the output square\\'s value should be the color of the diagonal spots. However, if any other color interrupts the diagonal, such as black, then the output square is filled with black.\\\\n48. To obtain the output, you need to count the number of times aqua (number 2) and maroon (number 8) appear in the grid. If aqua appears more times, the output is aqua. If maroon appears more times, the output is maroon. If there is a tie, the output will be black.\\\\n49. To make the output, you need to find the colour (red or teal) that forms a cross pattern centred in the grid. The output should be the colour that forms this cross pattern.\\\\n50. To make the output, you have to look at the positions of number 8 in the input grid. If a diagonal from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner or from the top-right corner to the bottom-left corner passes strictly through the number 8 cells (meaning no black or number 2 cell is found on the diagonal), output 8. If not, check if in similar conditions the diagonal passes through number 2 cells, if yes output 2. If neither the diagonals pass strictly through number 8 or number 2 cells, output 0.\\\\n51. To get the output, you have to look at the geometric center of the input grid. The value of the cell in the output grid will be the same number as the cell in the center of the input grid.\\\\n52. To transform the grid, you have to check the central area of the input grid for the number that occurs the most. That number should be the only output for the grid. If there are multiple numbers that have the maximum occurrence, then check for the number that appears first when reading from the top-left corner, left-to-right, and top-to-bottom. That should be the output for the grid.\\\\n53. To make the output, you have to find the color at the intersection of positive diagonal from top left to the bottom right and negative diagonal from top right to the bottom left of the grid. The result will be black if the colors on the crossing point are different, or will correspond to the color on the crossing point if they match.\\\\n54. To get the output, you have to look at the largest connected component of the same color. This should be done without considering diagonals. Report the color of this component. If there are two or more components that share the largest size, use the color of the first component that appears in this reading order: from top to bottom and from left to right.  To translate it to numerical values, return fuchsia if the largest component is fuchsia (represented by 2), teal if the largest component is teal (represented by 8), and black if the largest component is black (represented by 0).\\\\n55. To make the output, identify the central 3x3 square within the input. Determine if the color majority within that central square is black (represented by 0), teal (represented by 2) or red (represented by 8). Then, fill the output square with the color that occurs most frequently within the central square of the input. If there is a tie between two or more colors, use the color with the highest numeric value.\\\\n56. To make the output, you have to look at the exact middle of the grid - if it is black, then the output is black, if it is teal, the output is teal.\\\\n57. To transform the input into the output, you should locate the center of the grid. If the center is black, the output will be black. If the center is red, the output will be red. If the center is teal, the output will be teal.\\\\n58. To make the output, you have to first split the input grid into four quadrants. Then, for each quadrant if the majority color is teal, assign it the value \\'0\\'. If the majority color is red, assign it the value \\'8\\'. If two or more quadrants share the same color, the output will be the color of these quadrants. If there are no more than one quadrant of each color, then the output color will be black.\\\\n59. The transformation pattern is a bit unique for this one. Start from the middle, follow a spiral pattern towards the edges. If, while moving in the spiral pattern, the next square of the same color, directionwise, is a continuation from the previous square in that direction or not interfered by black squares, choose that same color (green or teal) for the output. If both or neither the colors green and teal adhere to this rule, the output will be black, otherwise the color, either green or teal, which adheres to this rule will be the output.\\\\n60. To make the output, you have to check each diagonal line from top-right to bottom-left. If a diagonal contains two colors (red & teal), the output should be a black cell. If a diagonal contains only red cells, the output should be a red cell. If a diagonal contains only teal cells, the output should be a teal cell.\\\\n61. To make the output, you need to check the color of cells crossing diagonally from top left to the bottom right. If all colors match or all cells are the same color, then assign that color to the output. If they do not match, the output cell will be black.\\\\n62. To make the output, you have to evaluate the formations made by lines of color on the input and decide on which color wins according to the following rules:     1. If the form is a straight line, then blue wins.     2. If the form is a diagonal line, then teal wins.     3. If the form is both straight and diagonal, then red wins. If there is no form then the output is black. Please note that every other color apart from the winning color or black is considered an obstruction. Forms cannot be traced through obstructions and obstructions in a form result in an invalid form. For example, if there is any rectangle or square form including black, it will be considered invalid. Copy the winning form\\'s color to the cell of the output grid.\\\\n63. To make the output, you have to identify the color that appears in the middle cell of the grid. After identifying the color, make the output cell that color.\\\\n\"}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "After analyzing the rules, they can be categorized into eight distinct categories as follows:\n\nCategory 1: Rules based on the color of the center cell.\nCategory 2: Rules based on the color of the diagonal cells.\nCategory 3: Rules based on the color of the corner cells.\nCategory 4: Rules based on the color majority in the grid.\nCategory 5: Rules based on the color of specific patterns or shapes.\nCategory 6: Rules based on the color of cells in specific positions.\nCategory 7: Rules based on the symmetry of colors in the grid.\nCategory 8: Rules based on the color of cells in specific sequences or arrangements.\n\nSynthesized rules for each category:\n\n1.

The output grid will be the same as the smallest enclosed shape, not including the surrounding black line.\\\\n3. To make the output, you have to find the colored square(s) closest to the bottom right corner within a geometrical shape in the input. The color of this(these) square(s) will entirely fill the output grid. For example, in case 0, you find an 8 nearest the bottom right corner, so the output grid is filled with 8s.

The color of this nested square pattern directly becomes the grid color in the output, fully filling the output grid. The size of the output grid should be matched to the number of squares occupied by the identified nested square.

For instance, in Case 0, the smallest rectangles are teal, and the whole output grid is made up of teal cells.  So, the transformation is finding the color of the smallest rectangle that intersects the larger rectangles, which becomes the fill color for the output grid.\\\\n9. To make the output, you have to extract the color of the smallest rectangle from the center of the shape sequence seen in the input grid. Then create a new grid with that color in dimensions that match the smallest rectangle. The background would stay as black.\\\\n10.

Identify the centermost colored region that is not touched by the black border. Output this region as the transformed grid. If the centermost region is square, the output grid size should be 3x3, otherwise it should be 2x2.\\\\n24. To make the output, you have to find the smaller rectangle that is in the center of a larger rectangle, and duplicate it. The color of the output grid will be the same as the center rectangle in the input grid.\\\\n25.

To make the output, you must identify the color of the inner square from the input grid, and fill the entire 2x2 output grid with that color.\\\\n27. To transform the grid, you have to find the smallest square which located inside all other squares. The color of this smallest square forms the output grid. Thus, all cells in the output grid will be of the same color.\\\\n28. To make the output, find the smallest colored (non-black) square grid inside the larger colored grids. Then, write its color (represented as a number) into a grid of the same size in the output.\\\\n29. To make the output, you should isolate and dispense each large square of color enclosing another color until you reach the smallest colored square enclosed. This smallest inner square becomes the resulting output. Its shape and pattern define the output grid.\\\\n30. To make the output, you have to identify the colored rectangle that is furthest to the right in the input grid. Then you scale down this rectangle to fit in the output grid, maintaining the color and proportions of the original rectangle.\\\\n31. To make the output, you have to find the smaller square inside the larger ones. The color of this inner square becomes the color of the entire resulting square in the output. The color numbers in the examples are 8, 1, 7, 6, and 4, transformed into teal,  blue, orchid grey and yellow squares respectively in the output.\\\\n32.

Copying the exact color and arrangement of the smaller squares from the colored square from the input to the output. If the squares have different colors in the input, all are captured in the output grid.\\\\n33. To make the output, you need to identify the center-most color block in the large rectangular region, and replicate that as a color square in the output. If the center block is 2x2 to maintain symmetry, replicate the 2x2 block as it is in the output.\\\\n34. To make the output, you have to extract the colors of the smallest squares inside the larger squares and replicate them in a matrix according to their distribution in the original grid.\\\\n35. To make the output, you have to locate a rectangle that has another rectangle inside it in the input. The color of that internal rectangle is used to create square in the output with the same color.\\\\n36. To make the output, you need to identify the smallest non-black color square in the input grid. The output is the captured smallest square, scaled down to a square of size 1.\\\\n37. To make the output, you have to identify the innermost colored square that is completely surrounded by other colored squares or rows of black cells. The color of all cells in this square forms the output grid. Thus, the output grid color is the same as the color of the innermost completely surrounded square in the input grid.\\\\n38. To make the output, you have to find the smallest rectangle that exists within one of the larger rectangles, but not touching the edge. The color of this smallest rectangle will be the color of the output grid. The output grid\\\\\\'s size is determined by the smallest rectangle\\\\\\'s dimensions. If there is no smaller rectangle inside a larger one, the output should be a black grid.\\\\n39. Select the smallest non-black square located in the input grid and mirror it as the output grid. If more than one non-black square of the same smallest size is present, select the square with the highest values.\\\\n40. The transformation involves identifying and extracting the smallest non-black coloured square enclosed within the larger square in the input grid. This smaller colored square is then magnified to fit the output grid size.\\\\n41. The transformation is happening by taking the middle-most blocks of the last colored section and representing them in the output. If the last section in the input is represented with a 2x2 color block, then the output grid will be a 2x2 grid with those same colored blocks. If the last section is represented with a 3x3 color block, then the output will be a 3x3 grid of the same color block.\\\\n42. To make the output, first find the grid with the smallest dimensions that fully encompasses the inner differently colored shape. The color number for the output grid cells is the same as the color number of the inner shape entirely contained in the input grid.\\\\n43. To make the output, you have to identify the color of the second colored ring in the big square from the input. All the boxes in the output grid are filled with this color. The color of the ring is found by eliminating the black boxes and the color of the outermost ring from consideration.\\\\n44. To create the output, you have to extract the color of the smallest square inside the bigger square from the input. The size of the output grid matches the size of this smallest square. Fill the output grid entirely with the color of the smallest square from the input.\\\\n45. To transform the input into the output, focus on the central square in the biggest shape made of colored squares. The color of the output corresponds to the central square\\\\\\'s color, and its size matches that of the central square.\\\\n46. To make the output, you have to find the second innermost colored block in the input grid. When you locate this block, copy its color to form a smaller block in the output grid. The size of the output block should match the size of the corresponding block in the input grid excluding its outer color layer. Fill the entire output block with the color found.\\\\n47. To transform the input grid to the output grid, extract or identify the smallest enclosed object within the larger object (if there\\\\\\'s more than one large object, select the one where the surrounding colored area is the smallest). The output grid should be the same as this smallest enclosed object. Ignore all other squares or rectangles and the larger enclosing shapes.\\\\n48. The process is to identify the smallest square of a certain color within the largest square of this color. All black cells and other colors are ignored. The output grid is then made up of the same color cells as the smallest square identified. The output grid\\\\\\'s dimensions are equivalent to the dimensions of the smallest square identified.\\\\n49. To make the output, the transformation seems to be about extracting the second most inner ring of colored squares (If black squares are considered rings). The color of the extracted squares maintains the same color in the output. The height and width of the output square is equal to the count of height and width respectively of the condensed squares of the corresponding color in the input. If the count on either axis is one, output would be a line of the corresponding color\\\\\\'s squares.\\\\n50. To get the output, look for the grid that has the smallest area in the input. Then reproduce the content of this particular smallest grid in the output. The smallest grid is completely enclosed by a different color on all sides.\\\\n51. To make the output, you have to find the smallest, most internal square seen in the input. Copy it and resize accordingly to fit the size of the output grid. The output preserves the color of the internal cells of the smallest square present in the input pattern.\\\\n52. To make the output, you have to locate the smallest color square that is entirely enclosed within another color square. The output is then this smallest square, excluding the squares of black color on its boundary.\\\\n53. To make the output, you have to identify the smallest rectangle of color that is inside another rectangle of a different color. The color of the smallest rectangle will be used to fill the output grid.\\\\n54. To make the output, you have to find the smallest square of colored cells that is contained within another square of colored cells. The color of the cells in this inner square dictates the output color. The output grid should be a 2x2 square of this color.\\\\n55. To make the output, you have to find the colored square region inside the second blue region from top and reproduce it in the output. Only the cells of the colored square are preserved. The other cells are deleted. The size of the output corresponds to the size of that colored square.\\\\n56. To generate the output grid, we extract the color of the middle rectangle (the second from outside towards the center) from the input grid and fill every cell of the 2x2 output grid with this color.\\\\n57. To form the output grid from the input, you should locate the smallest colored square that exists within another, and reproduce it on the output grid, maintaining its size and color. This involves finding the smallest non-black square fully enclosed by a larger non-black square. The color of the smaller square on the input dictates the color of the output grid.\\\\n58. The transformation rule/pattern here involves identifying colored sub-squares/grid in the largest grid. You need to identify and extract the smallest colored sub-square (the smallest square not containing any black cells), that is located at the bottom right of the larger square and just before the next pattern or \"0\" separator. This small square will be the output grid.\\\\n59. To make the output, you have to find the smallest colored square (which is not black) that is located at the center of the grid and replicate that to create the output grid. The size of the output grid depends on the size of the smallest colored square in the input grid.\\\\n60. The transformation involves identifying and isolating the smallest coloured box that is enclosed inside another box from the input grid, and forming the output grid from this smaller box.\\\\n61. To make the output, you have to find the smallest colored square fully contained within a larger colored square. You then need to create a new 3x3 square consisting entirely of this smallest colored square. If there are two potential smallest squares, select the one that appears lower in the input grid.\\\\n62. To make the output, you have to find the inner shape of the design. Identify the color of the filled squares of the most inner shape and create an output grid with the same color squares. The size of the output grid is determined by the size of the most inner shape. The color of the output grid matches the color of the most inner shape on the input grid.\\\\n63. To make the output, you need to extract the color of the square in the center of the surrounded square group. The central square color will fill all the squares in the output grid.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "After analyzing the rules, they can be categorized into eight distinct categories based on their similarities:\n\nCategory 1: Rules focusing on the smallest rectangle or square within the grid.\nCategory 2: Rules focusing on the smallest colored shape within the grid.\nCategory 3: Rules focusing on the smallest square or rectangle located in a specific position within the grid.\nCategory 4: Rules focusing on the smallest square or rectangle that is fully enclosed within another shape.\nCategory 5: Rules focusing on the smallest square or rectangle that is nested within another shape.\nCategory 6: Rules focusing on the smallest square or rectangle that is located in the center of the grid.\nCategory 7: Rules focusing on the smallest square or rectangle that is not touching the edge of the grid.\nCategory 8: Rules focusing on the smallest square or rectangle that is located at the bottom right of the grid.\n\nSynthesized Rules:\n\nCategory 1: To make the output, identify the smallest rectangle or square within the grid.

For each category, synthesize the rules into a single, specific rule that combines the ideas of all rules in that category, while clearly differentiating it from the other categories.\\\\nThe new rule should be as specific as possible, following the format of the given rules.\\\\nThe new rule should be applicable without any information from the original rules - i.e. it should be standalone.\\\\n\\\\nRules:\\\\n1. To make the output, you have to identify the cell that differs in the colored shape and create a vertical line of the same color, starting from the position of that cell and extending down to the bottom of the grid.\\\\n2. To make the output, you have to find the cell with a unique color inside the colored shape and draw a vertical line in red (colored number 2) from that cell down to the bottom of grid.The rest of the grid should remain the same.\\\\n3. To make the output, identify the color that stands out from the geometrical shape. In all cells beneath this specific cell, you have to replace the color with the standout color, until reaching the lower edge of the grid.  Other cells in the grid should remain untouched. The exception to this rule is if another cell of the standout color exists vertically below within the geometrical shape. In such case, replace cells starting from this cell downwards.\\\\n4. To make the output, you have to identify the smallest number in the non-zero elements and then extend that color in the entire column where it is found, downwards. Only the cells below the identified point get filled with that color and the color fills up until it reaches the end of the grid or another color. If there are black cells in the column below the starting point, they get filled with the color as well.\\\\n5. You have to copy the line in the input grid that contains an element which is not part of the majority of the non-black colors (which is surrounded by the majority color). Continue copying that line straight down until you reach the end of the grid or another non-black line. The remaining parts of the grid that are not covered by this process should be kept black. It can also be understood as a \"color-dropping\" procedure from this specific line to the down direction.\\\\n6. To make the output, you have to scan the grid from top to bottom until you find a blue or a teal square. Once you find the blue or teal square, mark its column from the blue or teal square till the bottom with appropriate color. If the blue or teal square has a red square on its right, mark the column with a red color. If the blue or teal square has a teal square on its right, mark the column with a teal color.\\\\n7. In the shape created by the non-black cells in the input grid, take the grid column which has a different color from the rest in the shape. Extend this color down the column until the end of the grid. Leave all other cells in the grid the same as they were in the input.\\\\n8. To make the output, start by finding the row with the highest value that is not zero. Then fill all black cells under that row with this highest value.\\\\n9. To make the output, you have to identify the lowest non-black (non-zero) number in the structure. Once identified, from the position of the lowest non-black (non-zero) number, fill the subsequent cells in the same row or column with that lowest number until you reach a non-black (non-zero) number or the end of row or column. In this case, the lowest identified number is blue (1) in the first example and orange (3) in the second/third examples.\\\\n10. To make the output, you need to look for the unique color in the shape. Once the unique color is identified, start at the position of the unique color and continue to the bottom of the grid, filling every cell in the same column with that unique color until reach the bottom of the grid (i.e. the column gets extended to the bottom of the image from position of unique color).\\\\n11. To make the output, you need to identify the single cell of a different color inside the colored shape in the input. Draw a vertical line in the grid extending from this different-colored cell, from the top to the bottom of the grid, using the color of that different-colored cell. Leave all the other cells unchanged.\\\\n12. To generate the output, you have to find the row where the cell of a color different from red and black appears. Then, you have to fill the corresponding cell in all rows below it with red until the bottom of the grid.\\\\n13. To make the output, you have to draw a vertical line at the same position as the center of horizontal gravity of the shape, the line color is the same color with the unique single-pixel color inside the shape. If there are few or no unique colored single-pixels in the shape, draw an empty line.\\\\n14. To make the output, you have to follow this rule: If the unique colored pixel (not green in the input pattern) is encountered and there are green pixels below that unique colored pixel, then all the black squares beneath the unique colored pixel up to that unique colored pixel has to be turned into that unique colored pixel in the output grid, starting from 1 space below the unique colored pixel to the end of the grid. The rest of the pattern would remain the same.\\\\n15. To make the output, you have to follow the line of the unique colored cell inside the coloured shape, then continue this line downward until you hit the bottom border of the grid maintaining the same color.\\\\n16. To make the output, extend a line filled with the non-black, non-dominant color (if there is one - if not, choose the non-black color present) from the grid cell with the different color within the colored figure to the bottom edge of the grid. Keep all other cells as their original colors.\\\\n17. To transform the grid, find the row with the smallest amount of non-black blocks that includes a block that is not in the outermost columns. Then, starting from this row and extending downwards to the bottom of the grid, replace all the black blocks in the column where the smallest row\\\\\\'s non-black block is located with the color of that block. The grid\\\\\\'s top section and all other blocks remain unchanged.\\\\n18. To make the output, you have to identify the single colored object / pattern in the input grid and extend this pattern towards the bottom of the grid till the edge. The number of pixels added is determined by the original shape and position. The color of the extension is not the original color but the next available color which is firstly used in the pattern. The extension is in the horizontal line where the pattern first starts to minimize left to right.\\\\n19. To make the output, you have to identify the column in the input where the unique color (different from the rest) is located within the shape. This column should then be filled with the unique color from the top to the bottom in the output, while the rest of the grid remains identical to the input.\\\\n20. To make the output, you have to locate the point of the shape which is a different color from the rest of the shape. Extend a line from this point until it reaches the bottom of the grid. This line should be the same color as the different colored point. The rest of the grid remains the same.\\\\n21. To make the output, you have to locate the pattern where a single cell of a unique color (other than the majority color) is surrounded diagonally by cells from the same color. Once the pattern is identified, draw a vertical line directly below this unique colored cell until you reach another cell with color. If there is no colored cell below, draw the line over the entire height of the grid, starting from a cell below the unique colored cell.\\\\n22. To make the output, you have to find the rare color in the shape (a color used less frequently than the others) and draw a vertical line crossing from the top to the bottom of the shape with that rare color.\\\\n23. The transformation involves finding the position of the smallest non-zero number in each grid. If this number isn\\\\\\'t along the middle column, draw a vertical line with this number from this position downwards until reaching the bottom of the grid. If the smallest non-zero number is already in the middle column, no changes are made to the grid.\\\\n24. To create the output grid, locate the unique colored cell in the shape (i.e., the cell whose color isn\\\\\\'t repeating in the shape). Then color all the black cells below this unique colored cell in the same column, until the end of the grid, with the color of the unique cell. Keep the rest of the grid same as the input grid.\\\\n25. To make the output, you have to focus on the color that is not part of the overall shape, which is located inside the shape in the input grid. From the position of that different colored element, draw a vertical line downwards until the end of the grid with the same color.\\\\n26. To make the output, you have to identify the row with the unique colour that isn\\\\\\'t in the rest of the shape. From that row fill the rest of the grid with that colour until the last row.\\\\n27. To make the output, you have to draw a vertical line of non-black cells from the bottom of the stack of non-black cells to the bottom of the grid. The color of the cells in this line is the same as the cell in the center of the stack. The rest of the grid remains unchanged.\\\\n28. To make the output, you have to locate the row containing the maximum number of colored cells, other than black, in the shape. If more than one row contains this maximum number of color counts, choose the uppermost row. Then, change all black cells on the right of the most right colored cell (other than black) of that row and all cells that aligned vertically till the grid end to the vertically adjacent color. The cells to the left of this shape remain same in the output.\\\\n29. The transforming pattern involves expanding the unique colour line in each object in the input grid. This line in the output grid gets extended from both ends towards the bottom edge of the grid. Keep in mind that this line should maintain the same column position as in the input grid. Do not alter any other part or colour of the grid.\\\\n30. To make the output, you have to draw a vertical line from the top to the bottom of the grid, at a horizontal position identical to the one where the blue cell is located in the colored pattern in the input. The vertical line in the output should be in red color.\\\\n31. To make the output, you have to find the row which has the colored cell with the value 1. Then, fill the cells under the 1 colored cell and the two red cells under it with red cells. If there is no cell with value 1, then simply replicate the input grid.\\\\n32. To make the output, you have to spot the sole differently-colored block within the input object. Then, extend this different color vertically down till the end of the grid, converting any black blocks in its path to that color. All other blocks, both inside the object and in the surrounding area, remain the same.\\\\n33. To make the output, you have to first find the row where color changes from another color to black (these are colors at the border of the shape). Then, from the next row onwards, you fill up the cells of the column where the color switch happened with the color of the border. Continue till the bottom of the grid. If no such switch of colors from a color to black exist in a column, don\\\\\\'t fill it up.\\\\n34. To make the output, you have to identify the lowest row of the shape containing a cell that is colored differently from the majority of the shape. From that row onwards, fill all the cells in the same column with the color of that cell.\\\\n35. To make the output, you have to identify the color of the horizontal line in the middle of the triangle. After that, color all the cells vertically below the triangle with that color until it hits a another colored cell or the border of the grid.\\\\n36. To make the output, you have to draw a vertical line of mirroring cells (mirrored color-wise) from the center of the structure horizontally until reach the width of the grid. The color of the line will be the color of cell which is besides the center of the structure, horizontally. Rotate the whole grid 180 degrees.\\\\n37. To create the output, a vertical line should be drawn starting from the spot that is different in the middle of the shape (different color pixel or missing pixel within the colored shape). The color of this line and the direction (up/down) it should be drawn in depends on the arrangement and color of the shapes:  1. If the shape is from top to down as a vertical line and the spot have a different color, draw a line of pixels in that color down to the bottom of the grid.  2. If the shape is distributed in a horizontal manner and the spot have a different color, draw a line of pixels in that color upwards to the top of the grid.   All other pixels stay black.\\\\n38. To make the output, you look at the color pattern (not black) in the input grid. If the color pattern can be a horizontal line using 4 blocks or less, the color pattern in the output grid remains unchanged. If the color pattern uses more than 4 horizontal blocks, after the transformation, the rest of the column under the color pattern are changed to the color used in the color pattern. The color pattern remains unchanged if it is vertical.   For example, in case 0, the red/blue pattern is within 4 horizontal blocks so it remains as is in the output grid. For case 2, the green pattern at the top uses more than 4 horizontal blocks, so the column under the same color pattern all the way down to the bottom of the grid is changed to the same color as the color pattern (red in this case). In case 1, the teal pattern is vertical so the code isn\\\\\\'t triggered and the pattern remains unchanged in the output grid.\\\\n39. To make the output, you have to find the colored line of cells (blue or red) and another colored cell which is distinct from the main shape (green or teal). Then, the grid should be filled by changing the black cells that are part of the same column as the distinct colored cell (blue or green), to the color of the line of cells (red or teal) starting from the row where the unique colored cell (blue or green) is located to the end of the grid. The other cells should remain unchanged.\\\\n40. To make the output, find the horizontal line in the input where the color other than black and the color forming the majority of the pattern (predominant color) intersects - this is the peak of the colored design. Then fill every pixel below this peak down to the bottom of the grid with the color that\\\\\\'s not predominant in the design. The predominant color in the design is the color that occupies most of the space in the colored symbol. If no such unique pixel of different color is found within the design, leave the grid as is.\\\\n41. To make the output, find any complete column in the colored object that contains a colored cell which is not part of the perimeter of the object, and the cell below it is black. Colorize all the black cell below it in the same color of the found cell until reaching object of different color or if the row is complete. If multiple prior-mentioned cells are found, choose the one in the column with the least index first.\\\\n42. To transform the grid, first identify the unique color cell and then replace the black cells under the unique cell straight downwards toward the bottom of grid, with the color of this unique cell to create a \\\\\\'falling effect\\\\\\' or \\\\\\'trail effect\\\\\\'. The rest of the cells remain unchanged.\\\\n43. To make the output, you have to look for the single-celled color other than the primary color forming the small shape and extend this color vertically down the same column crossing the entire grid. That is to say, the color of the single cell is to be repeated vertically downwards the grid in the exact column until it reaches the end of the grid. The rest of the grid and the shape remains unchanged.\\\\n44. To make the output, you have to find the row which contains the least number (number-wise) grid element with the exception of black cells. After finding this row, replace all the black cells below this row until the end of the grid, to the right of the numberwise least grid element, with the same least element.\\\\n45. To make the output, each row of the grid is scrutinized, the row which contains the cell with color 1 (blue) is filled all the way to the right end with the blue color. If there is no cell with color 1 in the row, then that row is left unchanged.\\\\n46. To make the output, you have to find the center of the drawing and draw a vertical line of blue pixels from the middle blue pixel down to the bottom of the grid. The vertical line should pass through the first non-black cell of each row, starting from the row with the first blue pixel encountered when scanning the grid from top to bottom. This transformation results in a vertical blue line extending in the center of the drawing.\\\\n47. To make the output, the pattern is to paint the column blue (1). Find the column where the lowest color cell (any color other than black and blue) is, and paint everything below it, till the bottom of the grid, blue. If there are no colored cells, there are no changes. This should be repeated for each case.\\\\n48. To produce the output, make a column consisting of the same colored square as the different colored square in the shape from the input that goes from the different colored square down to the bottom of the grid. Leave the rest of the grid as it is.\\\\n49. To transform the grid, you first need to identify the unique colored cell (not red or black). Then starting from the row that this unique colored cell is on, fill all cells below that and in the same column with the unique color until you reach the bottom of the grid. All other cells remain the same as the input grid.\\\\n50. To create the output, you have to identify the figure in the input and the block color within it that\\\\\\'s different. Starting from the row immediately beneath the figure, replace every black cell beneath it with block of different color found within the figure all the way down the grid. The positioning of the resulting colored line will match the location of different colored block within the figure in the input. Leave all other cells intact as in the input.\\\\n51. To make the output from the input, you have to extend a vertical column from the single color cell (which is not repeated in the shape) that is in the middle of the colored shape until it hits the bottom of the grid. The color of the extended vertical column should be the same color as the unique cell within the shape.\\\\n52. To make the output, you have to connect the lowest square of the shape vertically to the bottom of the grid via a straight line of the bottommost color of the shape. The lowest square of the shape is determined by its position, not necessarily by its color. The rest of the grid remains the same.\\\\n53. To make the output, you have to extend a line from the point of the colored shape which is different than the other points of the shape. The line should be in the direction where there is only black space and should extend until it reaches the edge of the grid. The color of the line should be the same as the different point in the shape.\\\\n54. To make the output, you have to extend the unique figure point of the shape from its location throughout the remainder of the black grid to the bottom, while keeping the top part intact.\\\\n55. To make the output, you have to track down the arrow\\\\\\'s direction in the input grid, then follow the direction of the arrow, paint a straight line starting from the point at its tail and ending at the bottom of the grid with the color of the arrowhead. The other parts of the grid would remain the same as the input grid.\\\\n56. To transform the grid, locate the horizontal line in the shape that contains the highest number or the different color. Draw a line with the highest number or the different color to the bottom end of the grid, replacing the color at this vertical position if it\\\\\\'s different from the black background. It\\\\\\'s kind of drawing the down from the peak of the pattern until it fills to the bottom of the grid.\\\\n57. To make the output, you have to find the row with a single colored cell that is different from the rest of the cells in the shape. Then you draw a vertical line of the unique color from that cell all the way to the bottom of the grid.\\\\n58. To make the output, you have to draw a vertical line from the distinct color inside the shape straight down until the end of the grid. This line should be composed of the same distinct color. The rest of the grid remains unchanged.\\\\n59. In the output, the color of a horizontal line commencing from the unique cell in the input grid (which has a distinct color that is different from the rest of object cells) towards the right edge of the grid, is changed to match the color of that unique cell. All the other cells in the grid retain their original colors.\\\\n60. To make the output, you have to find the row which contains a pixel with color other than the majority and place multiple copies of that pixel from that row until the end of the grid in the same column. The copying stops if there is another colored pixel present in the column below. Copying behavior continues again until the end after passing the block of colored pixels. Note that the colors of the copied pixels depend on the color of the pixel in that column found in the unique colored row.\\\\n61. Draw a line from where an arrow-like shape is pointing to the bottom of the grid with the color identical to the arrow\\\\\\'s head. All other aspects of the grid, including other colored cells, remain the same.\\\\n62. To make the output, you have to identify the cell that contains the unique color that is not repeated elsewhere in the grid (in this case: yellow for the first case, yellow for the second case, and red for the third case). This unique color should be located inside a shape of another color (blue in the first case, teal in the second case, and green in the third case). You then have to continue the shape of unique color vertically downwards from its point of origin until you reach the end of the grid.\\\\n63. To make the output, you have to look for the region in the shape where a different color (not black and not the color of the shape) appears. Then you have to draw a vertical line of this different color from this region to the bottom of the grid. This line will overwrite any other colors in its path except black.\\\\n64. To make the output, you have to find the row with the most number of colored squares. Then replace all black squares in the rows below that row with the color of the square in the center of the pattern in that row.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "After analyzing the rules, they can be categorized into eight distinct categories based on their similarities:\n\nCategory 1: Rules that involve identifying a unique or different color within a shape and extending a vertical line of that color down the grid.\nCategory 2: Rules that involve identifying a specific numerical value within the grid and extending a vertical line of that color down the grid.\nCategory 3: Rules that involve identifying a unique or different color within a shape and extending a vertical line of that color up the grid.\nCategory 4: Rules that involve identifying a specific row based on a unique characteristic and extending a vertical line of a specific color down the grid from that row.\nCategory 5: Rules that involve identifying a specific column based on a unique characteristic and extending a vertical line of a specific color down the grid from that column.\nCategory 6: Rules that involve identifying a specific color or pattern and extending a vertical line of that color or pattern down the grid.\nCategory 7: Rules that involve identifying a specific color or pattern and extending a vertical line of that color or pattern up the grid.\nCategory 8: Rules that involve identifying a specific color or pattern and extending a horizontal line of that color or pattern across the grid.\n\nSynthesized Rules:\n\n1.

For each category, synthesize the rules into a single, specific rule that combines the ideas of all rules in that category, while clearly differentiating it from the other categories.\\\\nThe new rule should be as specific as possible, following the format of the given rules.\\\\nThe new rule should be applicable without any information from the original rules - i.e. it should be standalone.\\\\n\\\\nRules:\\\\n1. To make the output, you have to check if the blocks of same color in each row are different from the blocks of color in the other rows. If they are different, change those blocks to grey. If they are not different, meaning the same color appears in other rows, change those blocks to black. The exception to this is the middle row \u2013 always change it to grey regardless of whether the colors match any in the rows above or below.\\\\n2. To make the output, you have to check if all three blocks in each row of the grid are the same color. If all the blocks of a row are the same color, turn them all into grey blocks. If they are not the same color, turn them all into black blocks.\\\\n3. To make the output, you have to count the unique colors in each row. If there are 3 distinct colors in the row, change all the squares in the row to grey (5). If there are less than 3 distinct colors, change all the squares in the row to black (0).\\\\n4. To make the output, you have to follow two steps.  If a row has three same colored cells make the output row grey color. If not, turn the row to black.\\\\n5. To make the output, you have to check each row. Count the number of colors that appear once in each row and compare that to the count of colors that appear more than once.  If there is strictly more than one unique color (colors that appear only once) in a row, convert the whole row to grey. If there isn\\'t, convert the whole row to black.\\\\n6. If all the cells in a row have the same color, replace them with yellow cells in the output grid. If the cells within a row are colored differently, replace them with black cells in the output grid.\\\\n7. To make the output, you have to check each row separately. If all three boxes in the row have the same color, transform that row into a row of 5 (grey). If they are not the same color, make them 0 (black).\\\\n8. To make the output, you have to color the row grey if all numbers in the corresponding row from the input are the same. If the numbers in the row are not the same, color the whole row black.\\\\n9. 1. If the middle item of a row in the input grid is the same color as the items of another row, then turn all items of that row to grey in the output grid.  2. If the middle item of a row in the input grid is not the same as the items of any other row, then turn all items of that row to black in the output grid.\\\\n10. To make the output, you have to check whether all colors in the row are same. If they are same, transform the row into grey color (number 5), else the row should be transformed by black color (number 0).\\\\n11. To make the output, you have to apply this rule. If all cells in a row of the input grid are the same color, color the whole row Grey (5) in the output grid. If the cells in a row have two different colors, color the corresponding row entirely black (0) in the output grid.\\\\n12. To make the output, you have to count the number of distinct colors in each row of the input. If the number of distinct colors is 1, that row becomes grey in the output. If the number of distinct colors is 2 or more, that row becomes black in the output. This assumes that the count does not include black.\\\\n13. As a transformation rule, if an entire row of the input is filled with the same color, that row will be transformed to grey in the output. For a row that contains more than one color, it will be transformed to black in the output.\\\\n14. To produce the output, replace all squares of the most frequently occurring color in the input with grey squares, and all others with black squares.\\\\n15. To produce the output, replace the matching color frames of the input grid with grey, whereas replace the contrasting color frame with black. That means, if the top and bottom frames match, replace them with grey and if the middle frame is different, replace it with black.\\\\n16. To make the output, go row by row. If the colors in a row are not all the same, change every cell in that row into black. If the colors in a row are all the same, change every cell in that row into grey.\\\\n17. The transformation involves checking whether all three horizontal lines in the input grid are of the same color or not. If all the lines are of the same color, change the colors of all the cells to gray. If only one line is different from the others, change the colors of the cells in that line to gray and change the colors of the cells in the remaining two lines to black. If none of these conditions apply, change all the cell colors to black.\\\\n18. To make the output, you have to find the row with the minimum average color value in the input. For each square in that row, replace that color with grey(5) in the output. Replace all other colors with black(0).\\\\n19. To make the output, you observe from the top row going downwards. Transform the row with the least variety of numbers, if two or more rows share the same variety choose the uppermost, to all grey (number 5). All other rows will be transformed into black (number 0).\\\\n20. The transformation of each section relies on the number/color it contains. Notice that the top and bottom rows form and follow the same pattern if equivalent, otherwise they turn into black. While the centre row transforms into grey regardless of its input color.\\\\n21. To make the output, you have to count the number of distinct colors in each row. For each row in the grid, if the number of distinct colors is 3, replace the whole row with grey color (5). If the number of distinct colors is less than 3, replace the whole row with black color (0).\\\\n22. To make the output, you have to change the middle row to gray and any rows that have more than one different color values to black, while leaving rows with all similar color values as gray.\\\\n23. To make the output, you have to compare the numerical values of the colours within the rows. If all the numbers in one row are the same, colour the entire row grey in the output. If there are different numbers in the row, colour the entire row black in the output.\\\\n24. To make the output, you have to identify the stripe that is unique in terms of color. If two stripes have the same color, keep them black in the output. The unique colored stripe is transformed into a grey stripe in the output.\\\\n25. To make the output, you have to check each row against the others. If a row has any matching color with any other row, then change that row to grey in the output grid. If not, change it to black.\\\\n26. To make the output, replace the row with maximum unique colors with grey color. If multiple rows have the same maximum number, replace all of them. For the remaining cells, turn them into black.\\\\n27. To make the output, you have to count the number of different colors in each row. If a row has three same-colored squares, turn that row grey. If a row has two different colors, turn that row black.\\\\n28. In order to transform the input grid into the output grid, you have to check if each square in the top and bottom rows of the input match in color with the middle row. If the color of a square in the top or bottom row matches with the same location square\\'s color in the middle row, paint that square in the output grid gray (5). If it does not match, the square is black (0). The middle row of the output grid is always gray (5).\\\\n29. To make the output, you have to check the first and third rows of the input grid. If both of them have the same color, paint them in grey in the output and paint the second row with black. If they have different colors, paint them in black and the second row in grey.\\\\n30. You start by checking each 1x3 rectangle. If all three cells in the rectangle are the same color, then change all of them to grey in the output. If they are not all the same color, then change all of them to black in the output.\\\\n31. To make the output, you have to based on the majority color of each row. If the majority color of a row in input is same as the top strip color, set the boxes of the corresponding row in output grid to \\'5\\' (gray). If there is no color majority or the color majority is not similar to the top strip color, set the boxes to \\'0\\' (black) to represent black boxes. In other words, each row on the output grid is set to \\'5\\' (grey) if the color of the majority of the boxes in the corresponding row of the input grid matches the color of the first box of that row. Otherwise, the entire row is set to \\'0\\' (black).\\\\n32. Each row of the grid is observed individually. If all the numbers in a row are unique, replace them with zeros. If there is at least one duplication of a number in a row, replace all numbers of that row with 5s.\\\\n33. To make the output, look for the row in the input that is made up of the largest numerical value. Translate this row into the grey color (number 5) and the other two rows into the black color (number 0).\\\\n34. To make the output, look at each 1x3 row in the input. If there are three of the same color, then replace all colors in that row in the output with grey. If there are two of the same color and one of another color, then replace all colors in that row in the output with black. If each cell in the row is a different color, then replace all colors in that row in the output with black. If there are two cells with the same color and one different color, replace all colors in that row with black.\\\\n35. To make the output, check each row in the input grid, if all the elements in a row are the same, make the entire output row gray, otherwise, if there are any differences in the rows, make the entire output row black.\\\\n36. To make the output, you have to find the most common color among the three rows. If a row has the same color as the most common one, replace all cells in that row with grey. If it doesn\\'t, replace with black.\\\\n37. The transformation involves checking the numbers in the first and third spots. If the first and last numbers in the top row are equal to the first and last numbers in the bottom row, then the entire row transforms into 5. Otherwise, fill the row with 0.\\\\n38. To make the output, you have to color the entire row based on the most frequent number in the row of the input. If there isn\\'t a most frequent number (i.e. all numbers are different or there is a tie), paint the entire row grey. If the most frequent number is present twice or more in the row, paint the row black. If the most frequent number is present only once in the row, paint the row grey.\\\\n39. To make the output, you need to check the middle column; if this column is entirely of the same color, then make the corresponding row in the output grid all grey (value 5), else the row would be made black (value 0).\\\\n40. To make the output, you have to turn the rows containing at least two similar colors into 5 (grey). All other rows are turned into 0 (black).\\\\n41. To make the output, you have to check the colors in the rows. If the colors in the upper and lower rows match, change all boxes in the midpoint row to color Grey. Otherwise, turn all boxes in the midpoint row into color Black.\\\\n42. For each row, if all numbers in that row are similar, then translate them to the number 0. If some or all numbers are not similar, translate them to the number 5 in the output.\\\\n43. To make the output, you have to change the color of all rows in the input grid where there is at least one number that\\'s not same as others in a row to gray. All other rows, where all numbers are the same, should be changed to black in output.\\\\n44. To make the output, you need to look at each row individually. If two or more of the cells in a row are of the same color, replace all the cells in that row with grey in the output grid. If none of the cells in a row match in color, then replace all the cells in that row with black in the output grid.\\\\n45. To make the output, you have to check the first and third rows. If the colors in those rows are the same, turn the corresponding row in the output to 5 (grey). If not, turn the row in the output to 0 (black). The middle row of the output should always be changed to 5 (grey).\\\\n46. To make the output, you have to check each row in the input. If all the numbers (colors) on a row are the same, then replace them with grey (5). If the numbers (colors) in the row are different, replace them with black (0).\\\\n47. To make the output, you have to determine if all numbers in a row are the same or different. If all numbers in the row are the same, replace the row in the output with the number 5 (represented as grey). If the numbers in the row are different, replace the row with the number 0 (represented as black).\\\\n48. Transform the input grid to the output grid by checking the top and bottom row. If each cell in a row is of the same color, transform the whole row to grey. If there are different colors in a row, transform the whole row to black in the output grid.\\\\n49. To make the output, you have to evaluate each corresponding pairs of boxes in the first and third row of the grid: if they match (both boxes share the same color) transform all three boxes on the corresponding column of the output to grey, if they do not match, transform these boxes to black. The middle row of the grid should always transform to a row of grey boxes.\\\\n50. To get the output from the input, check if the top and bottom colors are the same. If they are, they turn into gray (5) and the middle line turns into black (0). If the top and bottom colors are not the same, they turn into black (0) and the middle line turns into gray (5).\\\\n51. The transformation follows the rule that if all the numbers in a row are the same, the row in the output grid is filled with the number 5 (here represented by the color grey.) If the numbers in the row are not all the same, the row in the output grid is filled with the number 0 (represented by the color black.)\\\\n52. For transforming the input grid to output grid, you have to follow certain rules. If all three numbers in the row are the same in the input grid, change all three numbers to 5 in the output grid. If the three numbers in a row are not the same in the input grid, change all three numbers to 0 in the output grid.\\\\n53. To make the output, you have to check which row among the three rows contains unique colors only (different from the colors in the other two rows). For the row of unique colors, convert its colors into grey in the output. The other two rows with at least one color identical to the colors in other rows should be turned black in the output.\\\\n54. If each row in the input grid consists of only one type of color, replace all the cells in the corresponding output row with grey color. If a row in the input grid has different colors, replace all the cells in the corresponding output row with black color. In other words, if there\\'s variety in color within a row in the input, that row should be black in the output, and if all cells in a row have the same color, that row should be grey in the output.\\\\n55. To acquire the output, you detect the row that has different color from the other two. Change that row to color black (0) and change the other two rows that have the same color to color grey (5).\\\\n56. To make the output, check the color of the boxes in each row. If all three boxes in a row have the same color, change the boxes in that row to the grey in the output. If the row contains more than one color, change all the boxes in that row to black in the output.\\\\n57. To make the output,  check each row in the input and apply the following rules: - if all three items in a row are identical, the output for that row should be composed of three 0s - if two items in a row are identical and the third one is different, the output for that row should be three 5s.\\\\n58. The transformation involves the change of the color of the boxes. Each box of the most frequently appearing color in the input grid should be changed to yellow in the output grid and all others changed to black.\\\\n59. For transforming the input grid to the output grid, one must check if the middle column of the grid has the same colour. If all colours in the middle column are not the same, then replace that whole row with grey. If they are the same, then replace the whole row with black.\\\\n60. To make the output, look at each row. If the row has all similar color squares, then transform the entire row into grey in the output. If not, transform the entire row into black in the output.\\\\n61. To make the output, check the color of the middle section, if it matches any color of the top or bottom section, color that section in output as grey else leave it black. Keep middle section as black always.\\\\n62. To make the output, verify if the majority of the colors in each row of the input are identical.  If all three colors in the row are the same, color all three squares in that row a grey (5) in the output. If not all three are the same, color all three squares in that row black (0) in the output.\\\\n\"}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "After analyzing the rules, they can be categorized into eight distinct categories as follows:\n\nCategory 1: Rules that involve checking if all colors in a row are the same.\nCategory 2: Rules that involve counting the number of unique colors in a row.\nCategory 3: Rules that involve comparing colors in a row with colors in other rows.\nCategory 4: Rules that involve checking the frequency of colors in a row.\nCategory 5: Rules that involve checking the middle row specifically.\nCategory 6: Rules that involve comparing the top and bottom rows.\nCategory 7: Rules that involve checking the majority color in a row.\nCategory 8: Rules that involve checking for specific color patterns or conditions in a row.\n\nSynthesized rules for each category:\n\n1.

For each category, synthesize the rules into a single, specific rule that combines the ideas of all rules in that category, while clearly differentiating it from the other categories.\\\\nThe new rule should be as specific as possible, following the format of the given rules.\\\\nThe new rule should be applicable without any information from the original rules - i.e. it should be standalone.\\\\n\\\\nRules:\\\\n1. To make the output, you have to rotate the \"E\" shape 90 degrees counterclockwise and expand it to fit the 3x6 grid. The resulting object should be the same color as the object in the input.\\\\n2. To get the output, you have to locate the colored shape in the input and rotate it 90 degrees to the left, filling in black cells where they correspond for the shape.\\\\n3. To generate the output, you have to expand the 2x2 colored square from the input to fill a 3x6 rectangle. The first column of the rectangle is filled by repeating the left column of the 2x2 square, the middle columns are filled with the center cell of the 2x2 square and the last column is filled with the repeat of the right column of the 2x2 square. The top row of the rectangle is filled by repeating the top row of the 2x2 square, the middle rows are filled with the center cell of the 2x2 square and the bottom row is filled with repeat of the bottom row of the 2x2 square. The value of the center cell of the 2x2 square is determined by the diagonal cells (top-left and bottom-right). If they are same, the center cell is same as them and if not, the center cell is black.\\\\n4. To make the output, you have to locate the colored shape, and then you have to transform the 2D shape into a flat 3x6 grid. The resulting object will have three rows. In the top and bottom rows, if the original object had a color at the left, middle, or right, then the two corresponding cells will be colored in the output grid. In the middle row, if the original object had a color in the middle three cells it will be colored in cell 2 of the output grid. The other two cells in the middle row are only colored if there is a color in the cell just above or below the middle three cells in the 2D object.\\\\n5. To make the output, you have to morph and enlarge the shape from input. The 3x3 color square is transformed into a 3x6 rectangle, taking the color from the original square and covering two columns with it. For the central column it copies the line color values from the top to down, duplicating each color. This is mirrored to the right side. For the first and last column it copies the arrangement of the first color found from up to down disregarding the black cells.\\\\n6. To make the output, you have to find the colored 3x3 figure in the input and reproduce it in the output. In the output, the 3x3 figure should be reflected in a mirror placed on its right side. The central line of figures from the reflected 3x3 figure superimposes the central line from the original 3x3 figure.\\\\n7. To make the output, you have to convert the 3x3 block of color into a 1x2 block of the color in the original 3x3 block, sandwiched between two 1x2 blocks of black cells. This is done for three corners of the 3x3 block: top left, top right, and bottom center. Meanwhile, the remaining cells should be colored the same as the center cells of the original 3x3 block in the input.\\\\n8. To make the output grid, the coloured area of the initial grid is mirrored horizontally and vertically both, and displayed as a 3x6 rectangle. Here, the original coloured area is positioned either in upper left or lower right corners and its mirrored reflections are filled in the remaining space.\\\\n9. To make the output, you have to perform a rotation of 90 degrees counterclockwise on the non-black cells of the input grid and then reflect those cells over the vertical axis. After performing these transformations, the color of the cells remains the same.\\\\n10. To make the output, you have to take the 3x3 shaped object located in the top right quadrant in the input, reflect it horizontally and vertically to resemble the shape of a \\\\\\'Z\\\\\\'. The result should be placed in the middle of the grid. Residual cells in the grid should be black.\\\\n11. To make the output, you have to find the color in the middle row of the input grid. Copy the pattern of forming the color number in the middle of the input grid to the output grid. But the order of the rows is mirrored. The top row becomes the bottom row, the middle row remains the middle, and the bottom row becomes the top row. Reflect each of these rows to form the output.\\\\n12. To generate the output from input, the grid can be transformed as follows: you need to rotate the input grid to the right so the \"T\" or \"J shape\" is oriented correctly, then you should remove all black cells (background). Finally, You should also keep only the rows and columns which contain at least one non-black cell.\\\\n13. To make the output, you have to represent the colored shape from the input by framing it and arranging the colored cells and the empty cells in its perimeter in a way that maintains the symmetry of the original shape. Any segment of cell in the perimeter of the shape should be reflected on the corresponding opposite side in the output. The perimeter grid and it\\\\\\'s opposite side form the final output.\\\\n14. To make the output, you need to take the top 4x8 part of the input grid and resize it to a 3x6 grid. The color and overall shape is preserved, but the shape is squished vertically and stretched horizontally.\\\\n15. To make the output, you have to first isolate the colored 4x3 grid. Then, rotate this shape clockwise by 90 degrees to get the final 3x6 shape.\\\\n16. To make the output, rotate the colored shape 90 degrees clockwise, and mirror it horizontally. Then place the mirrored shape on the right of the original rotated shape. Due to mirroring, the color appears to be on the opposite side of the output after transformation.\\\\n17. To make the output, you should first extract and condense the colored 3x3 square from the left-top side of the input grid into the left-most 3x3 grid in the output. Do the same with the colored 3x3 square from the right-top in the input and place its condensed output into the right-most 3x3 grid in the output, leaving a column of blank space in between the squares. When condensing the squares, columns with no colored cells on the grid should be removed. Whenever there exists a colored cell, keep that column and order should be preserved.\\\\n18. To make the output, rotate the colored pattern 90 degrees counterclockwise, ignore black cells and trim the result to a rectangle which fits the transformed pattern.\\\\n19. To make the output, you have to rotate the upside \"T\" symbol clockwise by 90 degrees. This makes the \"T\" symbol into a regular \"T\" shape, which is positioned in the center of the output grid. The rest of the cells in the output grid are filled with the number 0 (black color).\\\\n20. To make the output, take the T-shaped pattern from the input grid, rotate it 90 degrees counterclockwise, and place it in the output grid, preserving the color. The T shape should still be pointed towards the center of the grid in the output.\\\\n21. To make the output, take the top-most and the bottom-most colored rows to serve as the top and bottom row of the new grid. For the middle row of the new grid, take the column before and after the maximum width of the colored shape from the original grid, and combine them together to form the middle row. If the colored shape in the original grid does not touch the top-most row, fill the top row of the new grid with black. Apply the same rule to the bottom-most row. The color remains the same in transformation.\\\\n22. To generate the output, rotate the \\\\\\'L\\\\\\' shape 90 degrees clockwise. Remove all the black cells that surround the shape, and shrink the grid so that only the rows and columns with colored cells remain.\\\\n23. To produce the output, the filled portion of the input grid needs to be reflected along its vertical axis and then stretched vertically in order to create a 3x6 output grid. The fill color remains unchanged during this transformation.\\\\n24. To make the output grid, you have to reflect the L shape along the horizontal to create an upside down L that is identical to the original. Then place them side by side and reflect the entire structure across the central vertical axis.   The resulting image should have four L shapes, with one flipped L shape at the top-left, one standard L-shape at the top-right, one standard L-shape at the lower-left, and one flipped L-shape at the lower right. The four L shapes are all oriented such that they are pointing towards the center of the output grid.\\\\n25. To make the output, you have to identify the colored shape in the top half of the input. Duplicate this shape within the output grid. The shape should remain in top-middle of the output, and then mirror it left-to-right and bottom-to-top. Where the shape intersects itself after being mirrored, turn these intersections black. The rest of the output grid should be filled in with the color of the shape from the input grid.\\\\n26. To transform the input grid into the output, detect the colored object and rotate it 90 degrees clockwise. Then, place it into a 3x6 grid. The new grid should have the top of the rotated object at the top, and cut off any of the object\\\\\\'s parts that don\\\\\\'t fit the 3x6 grid.\\\\n27. To make the output, copy the 3x3 colored pattern from the input. Move the pattern to the left side of the output grid. Then, rotate the pattern 180 degrees and place it on the right side of the output grid. The pattern keeps its original orientation in the middle of the output grid.\\\\n28. To make the output, you have to first find the colored shape in the input grid, then trim all the black rows and columns on the outer edges of the shape. Finally, copy the original shape and extend a new row/column to each direction, filling it with the corresponding color value from the original shape, except that the middle cell in new rows/columns should be black (0).\\\\n29. To make the output, you have to compress the input grid vertically into half its size and get rid of all the black space. More specifically, locate the middle row of each color filled shape in the input grid and then copy that row as well as the row above and below it to the output grid.\\\\n30. To generate the output, you have to first look at the 3x3 matrix that contains colored numbers in the input grid. Then reflect this matrix through its secondary diagonal (bottom-left to top-right). Then place this transformed 3x3 matrix into the center of the output grid (the center here is depending on the mirrored 3x3 matrix, it\\\\\\'s not necessarily the center of the 3x6 grid). The rest of the grid should be filled with black cells.\\\\n31. To make the output, you have to take the colored figure from the center of the input, flip it horizontally, and mirror it onto right side. The resulting figure becomes the output grid.\\\\n32. To make the output, you have to take the shape from the top half and reflect it horizontally and vertically in the center of the grid to form a new 3x6 size shape.\\\\n33. The transformation appears to curve the two parts of the shape together towards the center. The center part that was mainly the empty black area in the input grid disappears, and the colored patterns move towards each other in the output grid.\\\\n34. To make the output, you have to rotate the colored shape 90 degrees counterclockwise, and map it to the output grid. The shape should be symmetric about the vertical center line.\\\\n35. First, we narrow the grid to a 3x6 grid. Then, the three rows of small shape in the input grid is reflected horizontally to the right side of the output grid, also extending any colored cells to fill the entire row. After reflection, there should be two identical shapes in each row of the output grid, separated by one column of black cells (For example, in case 0, the result is two identical teal colored shapes separated by one column of black cells in every row).\\\\n36. To make the output, you have to rotate the colored cross or a line 90 degrees counter-clockwise. Then flip the result horizontally to complete the transformation.    For example: If you look at the first line of the input grid which has two colors (let\\\\\\'s say: [0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0]), the output of this line should be as follows: [8 8 0]. If you look at the second line of the input grid with color (let\\\\\\'s say: [0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0]), the output should be as follows: [0 8 0]. If you look at the third line of the input grid with color (let\\\\\\'s say: [0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0]), the output should be as follows: [8 8 8].   Here\\\\\\'s how that looks:\\\\n37. Cut the input into two equal parts, drop the second part. Then reduce each two rows in the first part into one by taking each two adjacent cells in a single row and combine them into one cell in the output. If two adjacent cells in the input are colored, color the corresponding cell in the output with the same color. If only one of those cells is colored, also color the corresponding cell in the output. If the two adjacent cells are empty (black), the corresponding cell in the output should also be empty.\\\\n38. The transformation requires focusing on the \\\\\\'T\\\\\\' shape in the input grid. The output grid represents this \\\\\\'T\\\\\\' shape but after rotating it 90 degrees clockwise and removing the black squares. The color of the \\\\\\'T\\\\\\' in the output is the same as in the input.\\\\n39. To make the output, you have to resize the \\\\\\'Z\\\\\\' pattern in the input to a larger \\\\\\'Z\\\\\\' pattern that fits the output. Fill in the parts of the output \\\\\\'Z\\\\\\' pattern with the color from the input, and fill the remaining spaces with black. If the input doesn\\\\\\'t have a \\\\\\'Z\\\\\\' pattern, fill the output with all black.\\\\n40. To make the output, you have to perform a 90 degree clockwise rotation on the shape and remove any excess outer rows and columns of zeroes. The aim is basically to re-orient the original shape from the second quadrant to the first quadrant by rotating it.\\\\n41. To make the output, one must rotate the middle colored square 45 degrees clockwise and then expand it to fill a 3x6 rectangle. Specifically, the corner cells expand to the corners, the edges expand to the edges, and the center expands to fill the middle.\\\\n42. First, make a horizontal slice through the main diagonal of the colored symbol in the input to obtain three lines of colored pixels. Then, remove the black pixels on either side of this slice in order to obtain a grid that is 3 rows high and 6 columns wide. The first line has color fitting to the first two and last two columns, the second row fits into all columns, and the last row fits into the second and third, and the forth and fifth column.\\\\n43. To make the output, you mirror the input colored shape horizontally and vertically around the center point to create a 3x3 square. If any of the elements lie outside the 3x3 square, they are not included in the output. The left and right sides of this new square are then duplicated to create the 3x6 output grid. The first and last vertical row are the mirrored image of the second and penultimate vertical row.\\\\n44. To make the output, you have to shrink the colored shape while keeping its corners, then reflect it around the y-axis. The overall shape scales down to 3x3 and its reflected copy fills in the entire 3x6 grid.\\\\n45. To make the output, you have to identify the shaped block in the input grid and remove the black grid cells around them. The formed shape from the colored blocks is then flipped horizontally and transferred into the output grid.\\\\n46. To transform the input grid into the output grid, you concentrate on the middle 3x3 square in the input grid. This 3x3 square is enlarged to form the output 3x6 grid by representing each cell of the 3x3 square with two identical, side-by-side cells in the output grid.\\\\n47. To make the output, you have to take the colored L-shape in the input, convert it into a mirrored \"-Z-\" shape, and place it in the output grid. The output grid takes up the entire space and maintains the same color as the input.\\\\n48. To transform the grid, extract the top right quadrant of the pattern, then mirror it horizontally and join this mirrored version to the right of the original quadrant. Now, mirror this new combination vertically and attach it below the original combination forming a 3x6 grid. Now replace each black cell in the generated grid with the current color cell and vice versa to create the final output.\\\\n49. To make the output, you have to create a \"compressed\" or \"scaled-down\" version of the colored T from the input (removing blank/black). The formation of the colored cells in the output has the same pattern as the T in the input but on a smaller scale. All the black cells around and within the T are removed. The color of the output cells matches the color of the input T shape.\\\\n50. To make the output, you have to first identify the colored shape in input, then flip it from its horizontal and vertical axis. After getting mirrored shape, move it to top left corner of 3x6 grid. If after flipping, the shape is incomplete or grid positions are empty, fill it using the same color. If shape\\\\\\'s color is missing on any grid position, make it black.\\\\n51. To make the output, you have to locate the 3x3 colored square in the input and stretch it horizontally into a 3x6 rectangle, duplicating the middle column. This stretched rectangle serves as the output.\\\\n52. To make the output grid, you have to take the shape in the input grid and expand it to a 3x6 grid. The shape consists of the colored square in the center of the input grid and its surrounding squares that also contain the same color. The transformation should maintain the configuration of the colored cells, but expands the size of the entire structure. This transformation effect is like scaling up the shape and filling it into a 3x6 grid. So if a colored cell is at the top left corner of the shape, after the transformation, the corresponding position in the 3x6 grid will also be a colored cell. The same color in the input grid should remain the same in the output grid.\\\\n53. To make the output, you have to find the colored shape in the input. The output grid is a projection of this 3x3 shape. The shape is mirrored horizontally from the 4th length-wise row(line) in the 8x8 grid and moved to the 3x6 output grid without the black cells on its side.\\\\n54. To make the output, you have to re-shape the larger 3x4 figure that represents a letter into a 3x6 grid. The reshaping implies top row transform into the first two rows of output and the bottom row transform into the last two rows of the output. The columns are divided equally.\\\\n55. The input grid is transformed into the output grid by removing the black cells surrounding the colored shape. The shape then becomes a 3x6 grid in the output where the top and bottom row are a mirror image of each other, and the middle row inverses this pattern. The blue cell in the lower half of the grid is rotated around the middle horizontal axis to the upper half. The center column is mirrored to the 5th and 6th column.\\\\n56. The transformation seems to be rotating the colored shape from the input grid 90 degrees anti-clockwise and unrolling it into a 3x6 horizontal bar of colored cells, with the rest cells colored black. The matrix is split into 3 groups 3x3 from top to bottom. The first 3x3 group gives the first 3x2 bar of the output. The second group gives the middle 3x2 bar of the output. The last group gives the last 3x2 bar of the output. Each 3x3 group is rotated 90 degrees anti-clockwise to get the corresponding 3x2 output bar.\\\\n57. To make the output, you have to flip the shape in the input grid both horizontally and vertically and then place the flipped shape in the output grid. However, do not include any rows or columns that are completely black from the flipped shape.\\\\n58. To make the output, you have to compress the input grid, with its objects remaining intact. The way this is achieved can be imagined as folding the input grid vertically and horizontally into a smaller square, causing the colored shapes to replicate themselves around the grid in the process. The final form is a shape that may not be identical to the source, but follows the same outline pattern as the source shape that occupied the 3x3 inner square of the input grid.\\\\n59. The rule that transforms the input grid into the output grid involves focusing on the colored blocks in the input grid. The output grid has a shrunk version of the colored symbol in the input grid where each block of 2x2 on the input grid becomes a single cell on the output grid. In other words, you are compressing or downsizing the blocks to one-fourth the size.\\\\n60. To determine the color in the output grid, divide the grid into 3 rows and 2 columns effectively creating six  4x4 cells. A cell in the output corresponds to the same cell position in the input. Wherever there is a colored square in a particular position in the input cell, there is a corresponding colored square of that color matching the position in the output cell. All other locations are black. Take for example, the top middle square in each of the cells in the input is black in all cells. Hence, in the output, it should also be black in each of the cells.\\\\n61. The transformation involves compressing the colored shape from the input grid horizontally by removing any column that does not contain color, leaving a space between parts of the shape that were separated by a column of black boxes. This compressed shape is placed in the output grid, preserving its original colors.\\\\n62. The transformation consists of selecting the colored shape from the input and forming a 3x6 grid by copying the upper half and mirroring it downwards, then removing the middle row. The top and bottom rows of the new form are composed of the entirety of the original shape, while the middle row is composed only of the middle line through the original shape.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "Category 1: Rotation\nRules: 1, 2, 9, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 22, 26, 34, 36, 38, 40, 41, 53, 56\nSynthesized Rule: To make the output, locate the colored shape in the input, rotate it 90 degrees (direction may vary), and place it in the output grid.

For each category, synthesize the rules into a single, specific rule that combines the ideas of all rules in that category, while clearly differentiating it from the other categories.\\\\nThe new rule should be as specific as possible, following the format of the given rules.\\\\nThe new rule should be applicable without any information from the original rules - i.e. it should be standalone.\\\\n\\\\nRules:\\\\n1. To make the output, select the top half of the grid, from the dividing blue row upwards. Keep colors consistent for this transformation. The row of blue boxes is included in the output.\\\\n2. To make the output, you need to take the top half of the input grid and ignore the rest.\\\\n3. The output grid takes the top half of the input grid and removes the central stripe if the height of the input grid is odd. If any cell in a stripe of the top half of the input grid has a different color from the main color, that cell\\\\\\'s color is preserved in the output.\\\\n4. To make the output, you have to cut the grid right after the orange line. The column of blues in case 1 and the column of reds in case 2 become the rightmost columns in the output grids. The rows in the output will be the ones where the cells on the left of the orange line have a different color.\\\\n5. To make the output, you have to locate the section of the grid above and including the first row of red pixels but not below it. Then remove all the columns except the ones from the first colored pixel to the red pixel in the row that contains the first change of color.\\\\n6. This can be viewed as zooming out where the top left, top right, middle, bottom left and bottom right colors of each 2x2 section from the top half of the input are shown in a condensed 1x1 square in the output. The  middle row of the input grid disregarded.\\\\n7. To make the output, you have to select rows from only the top half. Start with the top row, then choose every second row up until the horizontal line. For each selected row, include all elements/columns.\\\\n8. To make the output, we select the rows that contain at least one differentiated number from the input. The output square is then determined by the first square of the row leading up to (and including) the differentiated number.\\\\n9. To make the output, you have to copy the top half area of the grid, excluding the row in the middle that separates the two halves and ignoring cells that matches the color of the divide line.\\\\n10. To make the output, you have to find the half grid which contains the unique color that only appears once in grid halves. Remove the rest of the grid.\\\\n11. To make the output, you have to find the central column (or row), and return a smaller grid that includes the cells above and below this central column, including the column itself. Maintain all coloring as per the input.\\\\n12. To make the output, you have to find the smaller square grid from the input that contains the differently colored cross-section in the middle. That small grid from the input will become the whole output grid. The remaining parts of the input are disregarded.\\\\n13. To make the output, you have to take the portion of the grid located above the central horizontal line. The output grid will maintain the colors and positions of the squares from the top half of the input grid.\\\\n14. To make the output, you have to extract the vertical stripes from the middle of the grid, discard the rest of the rows and put the stripes together. If there is a different color than the main one in the extracted columns, it should be preserved in the output.\\\\n15. To make the output, you have to select the top part of the input grid and completely ignore the filled column and the bottom part.\\\\n16. To make the output, you need to cut the grid along the dividing line and keep the upper part including the dividing line.\\\\n17. To make the output, remove the colored strip and the bottom half of the grid. The remaining top half forms the output.\\\\n18. To make the output, you have to remove the right half of the grid along with the vertical colored line in the middle. The output is the left half of the original input grid.\\\\n19. To make output, you have to focus on vertical cross-section cutting through the middle of the grid, specifically the top half above the different colored stripe/line. Take each row of cells in this section and resize the row by half by removing every other cell. Do this for each row in the top half above the stripe to generate the final grid. The colors in the output correspond to the same colors from the input.\\\\n20. To form the output grid, crop the upper square from the input and paste it on a new grid. Leave the color variations within this square as they were.\\\\n21. The transformation involves taking the middle row and middle column of the large grid which is divided by the inverted cross and making a new grid out of it. This will include the color of the cross as the border of the new grid. If there are different colors scattered in the sections, they should be included in the output as they appear in the input.\\\\n22. To make the output, you have to locate a horizontal line in the input grid that separates it into two equal halves. Then, take the upper part of the grid and compress it to the size of the output grid such that you maintain the relative spatial positions of the different colors and maintain the pattern but at a smaller scale. The color that divides the grid maintains its position in the horizontal middle of the output grid.\\\\n23. To make the output, take the squares on the left side of the green vertical line in the input grid, if the square contains a number other than 3(green) carry it to the output grid leaving the right side of the green line. If a row has no numbers other than 3, that entire row is also copied.\\\\n24. To make the output, extract the section of the grid to the left of the central column of green cells. The output grid should mirror the cell colors in this section of the input grid.\\\\n25. To make the output, you have to extract the innermost square from the input grid, including any marker color present on the left side of the middle line. The output should include only this inner square and optionally a cell of the marker color, omitting any parts of the surrounding color and the middle line color.\\\\n26. To make the output, extract the upper half of the input grid and ignore the line and the lower half.\\\\n27. To make the output, you need to take the top left quadrant of the grid as it is, without making any changes to it. This would include all the squares in the full vertical bar within the top half rows and full horizontal bar within the left half columns.\\\\n28. To make the output, you need to cut the grid in the middle, right where the colored line is, and keep the left part.\\\\n29. To make the output, you should select the half of the input grid that contains the uniquely colored cell (cell that is not repetitive in the middle column) and eliminate the middle column. This half of the input grid becomes the output grid.\\\\n30. To make the output, you have to take the left half of each input grid. Ignore the middle line that separates the two halves. If a cell in the right half is different than the corresponding cell in the left half, then corresponding cell of output grid contains color of the different cell in right half, otherwise it remains the same as in left half.\\\\n31. The transformation is a reduction process and involves filtering. Identify the vertical stripe of different color and keep a single column from that stripe. Then, select the 2 columns on either side of that stripe. All other sections of the grid are discarded. The output will be the remaining 5 columns (stripe column and the two adjacent columns on either side).\\\\n32. To make the output, you have to preserve the information of the rows in the upper section of the input grid that comes before the row of separate color. Take each row, maintain the uniqueness in each row and leave out the part of the pattern from the lower section.\\\\n33. To make the output, you have to take the square from the top-half and remove the borders on the right and the bottom. The output grid will be smaller, but still maintain the unique number that is not teal inside the square.\\\\n34. To make the output, you need to take the upper 5x5 section of the input grid above the separating line, while preserving the distinct color marking.\\\\n35. To make the output, you have to select the top N/2 x N portion of the grid and discard the rest of the image because it is a symmetrical copy of the top part.\\\\n36. To make the output, you have to extract the upper half of the grid, excluding the middle line. Additionally, maintain the color-coded numbers in their positions.\\\\n37. To make the output, you have to remove the central rectangular strip from the grid and join the two resulting squares together. The row or column(s) that was previously on either side of the removed section will now be adjacent to one another.\\\\n38. To get the output, select the top half of the input grid including the middle line if the input size is odd. The output is the left half of this selection.\\\\n39. To make the output, you should take the top left quarter of the input, including the middle line, and drop the rest.\\\\n40. To make the output, you have to take the upper part of the input grid. The output grid will contain the cells exactly as it is from the top of the dividing line to the first row of the input grid.\\\\n41. To make the output, you have to take the inner part of the top half of the input grid. That is by excluding the first and last rows and columns of the top half of the input grid. The outcome will be a grid that contains a row or a column that varies in color than the rest.\\\\n42. To transform the input grid into the output grid, the left half of the top section, above the blue line and to the left of the green line, needs to be cut out and presented as the output grid. Any special color cell present in the region will remain the same in the output.\\\\n43. To make the output, The section which needs to be picked is left to the red line and it is mirrored on the horizontal line running through the blue cell.\\\\n44. To make the output, you have to take the top right quadrant of the input grid, preserving its colors and configuration.\\\\n45. Notice that the input grid has two same-shape parts separated by a line of arbitrary color. To create the output, select only the top part of the input grid (without including the separating line) and reduce this array by merging every four adjacent cells into one, taking the color of the last (bottom-right) cell in each 2x2 group.\\\\n46. To make the output, you have to pick up the upper half of the grid and disregard the rest. Any color remains as it is.\\\\n47. To make the output, you need to focus on the left side of the grid. All the squares from the left side of the grid are copied into the output, but you should only select the squares that lie to the left of the middle vertical line.\\\\n48. To make the output, you should take the left half of the input grid. Ignore the column that separates the two halves.\\\\n49. To make the output, you have to remove the column of numbers that makes up the dividing line from the original input. The output grid keeps the remainder of the rows from the input above and below the dividing line.\\\\n50. To make the output, you need to keep only the upper part of \"T\" shape in the input grid and discard the rest. Basically, you should slice off everything from the middle line downwards.\\\\n51. To make the output, extract the input structure between the differently colored middle column and right boundary inclusive. The transformed grid consists of the middle column and the part of the grid to the right of that.\\\\n52. To make the output, you have to extract all the squares present in the first half (above the line) of the grid, including the square on the line, and position them in the same layout as in the input grid. Ignore all squares in the second half of the grid (below the line).\\\\n53. To make the output, you have to cut the lower part of the grid and the vertical color band. The remaining section, which was the upper part, forms the output grid. Note that all cells and their colors remain the same.\\\\n54. To make the output, you have to extract the upper right quadrant without including the colored line that divides it.\\\\n55. To make the output, you have to take the left half of the rectangle (not including the middle column if the number of columns is odd), and keep only the rows that have a different-colored box on the same row in the middle column of the input grid.\\\\n56. To make the output, you have to focus on the top half of the input grid, excluding the middle row of red. In the top half, select the row just above the red row and all the rows before it until you reach a wax yellow cell. If a green cell is encountered, take note of its row and keep including rows above it until you reach the top or another wax yellow cell. These rows will be the rows in the output.\\\\n57. To make the output, you have to take the top section of the input grid above the dividing line, ignore the right half and focus only on the left half. The squares in the output grid will directly correspond to those in this left half above the dividing line.\\\\n58. To make the output, you have to keep the half which has a difference in color or where there is atleast one cell whose color doesn\\\\\\'t match with rest of the half. But remember to include the middle dividing line as well in the output grid.\\\\n59. To make the output, you have to remove rows and columns leaving only the 5x5 square which is surrounded by the smaller squares encapsulating the larger square in the original grid.\\\\n60. To make the output, you have to take the upper part of the grid, up to the middle line and ignore the middle column. The different cell in the top half will also be different in the output.\\\\n61. To make the output, you have to isolate the left section including the central strip from the rest of the grid. Then, remove the right adjacent cells of the central strip, keeping the cells with different color and those directly to the right of these. The resulting grid should display the vertically-aligned different color cells and the cells they were initially adjacent to on the right.\\\\n62. To make the output, we concentrate on the top section of the grid above the separating line. The output corresponds to this section, with any outlier cells from the bottom part transferred to their corresponding position.\\\\n63. The output grid consists of all the rows on the top half of the input grid that are above the middle row. The middle column and the two adjacent columns on its left and right are preserved. Any other columns outside these are discarded.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "Category 1: Rules that involve selecting the top half of the grid.\n- Rule 1\n- Rule 2\n- Rule 3\n- Rule 13\n- Rule 16\n- Rule 17\n- Rule 26\n- Rule 35\n- Rule 36\n- Rule 40\n- Rule 46\n- Rule 52\n- Rule 53\n\nNew Rule: To make the output, select the top half of the input grid, including the dividing line if present.

To obtain the output, you\\\\\\'re looking for colored cells contained within a 3x3 square that has its center cell empty in input grid and this 3x3 square is fully surrounded by black cells. Then, fill the same location in output grid as following: color three vertical cells in the middle of this 3x3 square with the color of the upper left cell of the 3x3 square and color the center cell of the 3x3 rectangle with color of the lower right cell of the 3x3 square in input grid. All other cells in the output grid should be black.\\\\n2. To make the output, you have to pick out the three highest numbers (not counting 0) among the numbers presented on the input grid. Form a 3x3 square in the center of the output grid with these three numbers, placing the highest number in the middle and the second and third highest numbers on its sides (forming a vertical line with the highest number in the center of this line). This line should be surrounded by the fourth number (if not available, use 2). Everything outside of this central 3x3 square should be black (0).\\\\n3. To make the output, you should take the color group and shift it to the bottom center that is making a 3x3 cell square. Where in the first and last row, every cell should be filled with a color of the top left cell from the color group. And in the middle row, the center cell should be filled with the color from the bottom right cell from the color group and on both sides, there should be filled with the same color as the first and last row. Everything else should be left black.\\\\n4. To make the output, look for the stretched out number 5 in the input (which is represented as grouped together with same colored cells), then move it to a lower part of the grid. Substitute all other cells with black cells. The number 5 after moving should keep its structure and placed starting at 4 cells upwards from the bottom, 3 cells from the left, and then expanded in the direction of the center by 2 cells.\\\\n5. To make the output, you have to identify the position of the line (or lines) in the input grid. Once the lines are identified, create a 3x3 square located centrally at the position of the line in the output grid. The central point of the square should match with the color of the line, and the rest of the square should be filled with \\\\\\'2\\\\\\'.\\\\n6. The transformation involves looking for a line segment of three color numbers arranged diagonally from top left to bottom right, with the color number in the center cell being different from the cells at both ends. The color in the middle of this line segment is extracted and a 3x3 square of that color is formed in the output grid keeping the middle cell of the square as the initially picked color cell. The rest of the grid cells remain black.\\\\n7. To transform the grid, first look for the coloured cell located in the center of the grid. For that, imagine a central square matrix of size 3x3 in the input which combination of the center and its adjacent cells gives 3 different colors excluding black. If we found this square, form a square of the color that appears most in this center square grid in the corresponding position in the output grid, same as the position for the center square on the input, otherwise the cell remains black. The square in the output has the most frequent color cell in the center surrounded by the least frequent color cells.\\\\n8. To make the output, you have to look for the square where the colored numbers increase by 1 (from top to bottom) and represent them in a red horizontal line in the center of the square. The progression consists of any three numbers such that the middle number is one greater than the top number, and one less than the bottom number. Replace the rest with black.\\\\n9. To make the output, you have to find the smallest square of coloured cells in the input that doesn\u2019t have an empty (black) line either horizontally or vertically through it. Transform this square into a horizontal line of 2s in the same position, with the middle number (if an odd number of boxes wide) or the middle two numbers (if an even number of boxes wide) replaced with the highest number in the original square. All the other numbers in the grid turn into 0s.\\\\n10. To make the output, you have to find this pattern in the input, when found, replace this pattern with a 3x3 square made up of number 2, with the last digit from the pattern at the center of the square. Fill all the other cells with 0.\\\\n11. To obtain the output, locate the colored number 2 that is in the center of the grid. Create a smaller square around the original colored number, where the colored number 2 is at the center of each edge of this new square. The rest of the grid remains zero (black). The distant between center cell of the shape and the border cell is 2 cells. The colored number at the center of each edge is always the same as the original colored number in the center of the input grid.\\\\n12. To make the output, you have to look for a 3x3 subgrid in the middle of input grid. Then, replace that 3x3 subgrid with a red border where the center is another color. If the center of the 3x3 subgrid is black, replace it with a red border and a black center. If the center of the 3x3 subgrid is a color, replace it with a red border and the same colored center. All other cells must be black.\\\\n13. To form the output, you have to detect the biggest rectangle drawn in the middle of the input, which is encoded by color repetitions on both sides of the grid. Observe a pattern that those rectangles are represented by repeating a certain color along the row and the column of the grid. Then fill with red color the pixels outside and within the rectangle, but preserve colors of pixels forming the rectangle boundary. The rest of the rectangle should be filled in such a way that the top and bottom rows, as well as the first and last pixels of the middle row, are red while the remaining pixels in the middle row have the color of the pixel that was in the center of the input grid.\\\\n14. To make the output, you have to find the 3x3 square matrix that is present somewhere inside the input grid. Replace every other element in the grid with black (or 0). For the found 3x3 square matrix, Take the center of this 3x3 square and place it in a 3x3 square in the output grid, keeping that at the center. For the other eight positions of this 3x3 square in the output grid, fill them with the color that is most found in the 3x3 square from the input grid. Fill rest of the grid with black (or 0).\\\\n15. To create the output grid, search for a blue cell in the input grid. If you find it, generate a 3x3 square of red cells in the output, with the blue cell\\\\\\'s position as the center of this square. The middle cell of the square you form should be colored by the number in the top right of the blue cell\\\\\\'s box in the input. Leave everything else as black. The squares are placed only within the boundaries of the grid.\\\\n16. To make the output, you need to first locate the non-black cell in the 5th column and create a horizontal red line across the sixth column at the respective row. Then locate the non-black cell in the 7th column and create a vertical red line at the respective column. The intersection of these two lines should be filled with the color from the 7th column\\\\\\'s non-black cell. All other cells remain black.\\\\n17. To make the output, you have to identify the 3x3 square in the center of the grid. Each cell in this square will be replaced by the number 2, except for the middle cell which will be replaced by a number currently present in a cell that forms a 45-degree angle towards the top-left or bottom-right corner of the grid. All other cells are black.\\\\n18. To make the output, you have to find the square of 3x3 cells that are partially or completely filled with colors, and then shift this square to the center of the grid. Replace all the cells inside this square with number 2, except for the center cell which should contain the original center cell value from the input. Except this 3x3 square in the center, all other cells in the output grid should be black (0). This cellular shifting and replacement reflects a focus on the central region.\\\\n19. The transformation involves encapsulating a colored cell in the input grid with the red cells in a 3x3 grid. Only the grids with no colored cells or colors only in the center are transformed. The center color remains the same whereas the surrounding cells in a 3x3 grid turn red (2). The other cells in the grid are turned black (0) in the output.\\\\n20. To make the output, you have to carefully observe the non-black colors of the middle box of rows, if there are any. This is your building point. From this point, above and below it, make a horizontal line that consists of three colored boxes, where the middle one of them is the same color as the first pixel you noticed, and the ones next to it are red(2). If there is no colored pixel in the middle of the row in the input image, keep them black as they are.\\\\n21. The output grid is primarly black. The first coloured square cell identified in the input grid will draw a \\\\\\'2\\\\\\' coloured symmetric square which has a width of three cells on top of the output grid. The square will inherit the colour of the first non-black cell in the input, and will be placed exactly at the same column it was found in the input, but at the bottom-most position. The inner cell of the square is coloured differently with a colour related to the last non-black cell of the input found starting from the bottom left corner and heading upwards and towards the right.\\\\n22. To transform the input grid into the output grid, first locate the 3x3 square of colored points that forms a border with a black point in its center. Transfer the 3x3 square to the center of the 10x10 grid in the output, replacing the color of the border points with the color of the center point in the input. The rest of the grid remains black.\\\\n23. To make the output, you have to identify the colored square with the highest numeric value in the grid. If you draw a horizontal line across the grid at the height of the middle of this cell, that forms a dividing wall. Everything above the wall in the output grid is black. Below the wall, you form a bracket consisting of three rows having the color of the highest numeric value (2nd and 4th row) and the color of the square just below the highest numeric value (middle row).\\\\n24. To make the output, you need to locate the three horizontal lines containing blue colored box (numbers 2) in the input. Replace the number 2 and adjacent black numbers with red boxes (number 2) and replace all other numbers on those rows with black boxes (number 0). For all the other rows, replace all numbers with the black box (number 0).\\\\n25. To make the output, find the smallest rectangle that contains all non-black cells in the input. Then, replace all cells within that rectangle with red, except for the center cell, which should be replaced with the color that is located in the cell at the center of the input grid. The rest of the output grid should be filled with black.\\\\n26. To create the output, first scan the input grid to find the left most non-black cell (cell with a number other than 0). This will be the starting point.  Then, find the right most non-black cell and the bottom most non-black cell to establish the other two corners of a smaller square grid, with the starting point as the top-left corner.  Recreate this smaller square grid in the center of the output grid, replacing all the cells within it with the number 2, except for the center cell which you replace with 3. The rest of the cells in the output grid remain black.\\\\n27. To transform the grid, you have to look for squares where 3 different numbers, other than 0, form an enclosed box in a corner. Then, you change the three outward-facing squares of the box as well as the central square, to the number that is on the top of the box, while leaving every other square as black.\\\\n28. To make the output, you start by identifying the center square in the input. That will be considered as the center square in the output. Then, you look for the first colored square in the direct left, right, top and down directions without any other colored squares between them and the center square. If you locate these squares, you create a 3x3 square like structure in the output by placing the located colored squares in the respective left, right, top, and down positions of the center square and filling up the other spaces with red colored squares in the black background.\\\\n29. Here are the steps to transform the grid:  Step 1: Find the square that is in the exact middle of the grid. (In the case of an even number of rows/columns, consider the middle to be the upper-left part of the center four squares.)  Step 2: From the middle, look at the four neighboring squares: above, below, left, and right. Ignore the rest.  Step 3: If multiple squares contain same color, make the middle square the same color. If squares contain different colors or some squares are black, leave the middle square as black.  Step 4: Do the same for the three squares in each direction (up, down, left, right) from the middle square. But, do not change the color of the original middle square.  In simple words, the output grid is created by forming a \"plus\" sign with the color of the cells adjacent to the central cell. If the cells are different colors, then the central cell and its surroundings in the \\\\\\'+\\\\\\' direction remain black.\\\\n30. To make the output, you have to identify the area in the grid that is surrounded by black squares. Replace the numbers inside this area by a 3x3 square with 2s on the border and the central number from the input. The remaining grid should be filled with black squares.\\\\n31. The transformation involves isolating a square of color surrounded by black in the input grid. Identify the square (or 3x3 sub-grid) with a colored pixel at its center, and at least one colored pixel on each of its four sides. Then copy the center and side colors to the corresponding locations in the output 3x3 square, and fill the corners of that square in the output grid with the same color as the corners of the input square. Set all other pixels in the output grid to black.\\\\n32. To make the output, you have to search for a vertically longest vertical line of a single digit number (any color other than black). Once you find it, replace it with the digit 2 in the output while keeping all other cells black. The cells adjacent to this longest vertical line which contains single digit other than 0 in the input should be replaced with SAME digit but only if they are horizontally aligned with the longest line. Everything else should be black.\\\\n33. To make the output, you have to find the smallest non-black rectangle on the grid. Once the smallest rectangle is found, you replace the interior cells with red color and border cells with the color corresponding to the top left coordinate of the rectangle. Everything else should be colored black. Define smallest as the rectangle with the smallest area. If there are multiple smallest rectangles, choose the one that appears first when reading the input grid from left-to-right, top-to-bottom.\\\\n34. To make the output, you have to find the midpoint of the clear blocks of colours in the input. Draw a horizontal and a vertical line through this point to divide the grid into four quadrants. Leave all cells outside the bottom right quadrant as black (0).   In the bottom right quadrant, evaluate the cells in the 3x3 grid centered on the midpoint identified earlier. If a cell in this 3x3 grid in the input is non-black, replace it in the output with the number 2 (red). If there is a number in the exact midpoint cell, retain it as it is in the output. This process forms the red 3x3 grid with its center being the same as in the input. The rest of the cells in this quadrant should be black.\\\\n35. To get the output from an input, firstly look for the row which is completely empty. Take the three rows just above this empty row. The transformation involves creating a horizontal line of \"2\" on the above, below, and the same row of the highest number found in these 3 rows. Surrounding the highest number with \"2\", replacing all other numbers of these rows to \"2\". For all other rows that are not part of the transformation, replace all numbers with \"0\".\\\\n36. To make the output, you have to identify the \\\\\\'center\\\\\\' non-black cell in a diagonal direction (bottom left to top right) and color the cell to red. Then, color the adjacent cells in the same row both sides to red for three cells wide. All the other cells will be black.\\\\n37. Take the smallest square block in the center of the grid that contains all numbers other than 0. In the output, replace all cells within that square with the number 2, while maintaining the original non-zero cell locations and its numbers. All other cells should be replaced with black.\\\\n38. To make the output, you have to find the middle point (row and column) of lowest non-black point located at the leftmost and rightmost non-black point and topmost and bottommost non-black point. You then draw a red (2) square around that point leaving the middle point as it is from the input and filling the square and the rest of the grid with black (0), whereas the square surrounds the middle point by one point from each direction.\\\\n39. To make the output, you have to identify the top left, middle, and bottom right box of each 3x3 sub-grid within the random colored boxes and replace them with red (2). The rest of the boxes should be turned black (0). If there is no 3x3 sub-grid within the random colored boxes, remove all the colored boxes to reveal a blank grid.\\\\n40. To make the output, you have to find the 2x3 region containing the color 4 in the input grid. If such region exists, paint a red rectangle of width 3 and height 2, with color 4 at its center in the output. All other cells in the output grid should be black.\\\\n41. To make the output, you have to first divide the input rectangle vertically into two parts. Look for vertical lines in the right half which contain numbers. These lines will be mirrored to the left half of the output grid, with the numbers replaced with number 2. The positions mirrored should maintain the original positions relative to the center of the grid. Fill any remaining positions in the grid with 0.\\\\n42. To make the output, you start by clearing all the cells in the grid, replacing the existing colors to black. Then you trace the smallest square that could be traced in the input leaving the corners blank. If the squares\\\\\\' corners are colored, replace it by the red color (symbolized by 2). Leave other cells black. If there is a cell of some color within the limits of this square, that cell keeps the color in the output grid but corners of the square replace other colors as well. The process seems to look from top down, so the first square found, in this case, it is a 3x3 square, is processed. Consider all cells outside of this square as black or empty cells.\\\\n43. The transformation involves finding the number 2 in the input grid and creating a solid block of red squares around its position in the output grid. The block is 3x3 squares, where the number 2 cell is in the center, and all other cells in the block are also colored red. The rest of the output grid remains black.\\\\n44. To make the output, first find the central square of 3x3 cells on the input grid. Then, in the output grid, form a square of 3x3, centered on the 6th row and between the 5th and 7th columns, using the following criteria:   - Redraw the center of the 3x3 square on the output grid using red. - Draw a cross using red on the squares which are diagonally adjacent to the center square on the input grid. - Keep the rest of the output grid black.   All other information from the input grid does not affect the transformation and should be ignored while producing the output.\\\\n45. To make the output, you have to remake this entire grid, but you only take patterns where there is a 4x3 square with the center cell of a different color, surrounded by a single color on the row or column axis. The rest of the grid cells should be black.\\\\n46. To make the output, you have to find the smallest square of colored cells that are not black. Then, reconstruct this square in the center of the output grid where its original color is replaced by red (2). The remaining cells must be black (0).\\\\n47. To make the output, you have to look around the grid for a 3x3 area, which is centered by color \"2.\" If any number in the 8 neighboring cells equals \"2\", then color the entire 3x3 square with color \"2\" in the output else leave it black. If the color \"2\" square exists on the edge of the grid so that a full 3x3 area can not be obtained, ignore that square.\\\\n48. To make the output, identify the 3x3 area in the input where the sum of the 3 colored dots in the middle row and center of the top and bottom row is 3. Replace each cell in this 3x3 area with \"2\" if their respective cell from the input is \"0\" to form a blue square. The rest of the cells should be \"0\".\\\\n49. To transform the input grid to the output grid, follow the steps below:  - Identify the cell in the exact center of the grid (cell at 5th row and 5th column). - Check the number in this cell and call this number \\\\\\'n\\\\\\'. - Now, create a new 3x3 grid within this 10x10 grid, centering it where \\\\\\'n\\\\\\' was found in the input grid.     - For the central cell of the 3x3 grid, replace it with \\\\\\'n\\\\\\'.     - For every other cell of the 3x3 grid, replace it with number \\\\\\'2\\\\\\'. - Every other cell in the 10x10 grid should be replaced with \\\\\\'0\\\\\\'. This includes all cells not part of the 3x3 grid.  The output grid will have a 3x3 grid centered in the middle, where the central cell is the original central number, and every other cell in this inner 3x3 grid is \\\\\\'2\\\\\\'. The rest of the grid is \\\\\\'0\\\\\\'.\\\\n50. The transformation is about encasing a number in a 3x3 box filled with a different number such that the number is surrounded by the different number on all the 3 sides except the side facing the \\\\\\'0\\\\\\' or black. Find the number that is followed by \\\\\\'0\\\\\\' in all four directions (up, down, left, and right), encase it in a box of \\\\\\'2\\\\\\'s, where the \\\\\\'2\\\\\\'s are on the sides that are not facing the \\\\\\'0\\\\\\'. Clear the rest of the grid by making them \\\\\\'0\\\\\\'s. The numbers (or color representations) of the input don\\\\\\'t matter as long as they are not \\\\\\'0\\\\\\'. The only requirement for the rule to apply is the numbers must be followed by \\\\\\'0\\\\\\' in all four directions.  For example: In Case 0, the number \\\\\\'8\\\\\\' is encased because it has \\\\\\'0\\\\\\'s on all around it. So, it\\\\\\'s switched to \\\\\\'2\\\\\\' and the \\\\\\'8\\\\\\' remains. All other numbers are switched to \\\\\\'0\\\\\\'. So, the pattern has taken this number and surrounded it with a\\\\n51. To make the output, you have to locate the cross shape in the input grid, then replace it with a square in which the sides are labeled by 2s and the rest is filled in with the number of the cross\\\\\\'s center. All other elements in the grid should turn black.\\\\n52. To obtain the output, you need to concentrate all the colored values around the target color to the center of the output grid, forming a square surrounded by a cushion of the same colored value as the target cell. The target cell is the center color of the butterfly-like shape in the input. The remaining cells are black. In Cases 0, 1, and 2, the target color is blue, pink, and green respectively. So in the output for these cases, the center square is surrounded by blue, pink, and green respectively.\\\\n53. The output is a 3x3 square of a certain color isolated within the black grid. The square\\\\\\'s color is indicated by the central color in the input grid. The central color of the square is the color in the right middle of the input grid.\\\\n54. To make the output, you have to locate the smallest square in the grid with a non-black perimeter formed by non-black cells. This square is then copied to the center of the output, having its perimeter cells turn into red (2). The rest of the output remains black (0).\\\\n55. To make the output, you must find the first colored cell below the primary diagonal line starting from the first row. For example, if the first row with color below the primary diagonal line is row 5, you\\\\\\'d pick this row. Next, looking at the main diagonal and taking a note of the colour at the intersection (for example, red or number 2) create a 3x3 square at the bottom of the output grid. The 3x3 square consists of a border with a color of the first non-black cell below the primary diagonal line with the center cell the same color as the intersection of the diagonal at the row. Fill the rest of the output grid with black cells.\\\\n56. For this transformation, look for the 3 by 3 square of numbers in the input, that forms a cross or plus sign pattern (central cell with four cells orthogonally adjacent to it) with numbers different than 0 (black). Move the square to the center of the output grid while keeping its original orientation and changing all the cells that are not part of this cross in the 3x3 square to be the same color as the center cell of the cross, all the other cells in the output are black.\\\\n57. To make the output grid, you have to look for a 3x3 region in the input that has an outer ring of colored cells with one different colored cell in the center and the remaining cells are black. Copy the this 3x3 colored block to the output grid but replace the outer ring colors with the color present in the top-left cell of the original 3x3 block in the input grid. The rest of the cells in the output grid should be black.\\\\n58. To make the output, you have to find the largest square formation in the input grid (where a colored pixel is surrounded by 8 other colored pixels), let\\\\\\'s call this the letter box. For this letter box, select the center pixel and replace it and its 8 surrounding pixels in the output grid with colored pixels in the shape of a smaller square (like a keyhole). It should be replaced in such a way that the color code of the outer square is equivalent to the color code of the top left pixel of the input letter box, and the color code of the inner pixel matches the color code of the center pixel of the input letter box. All the remaining pixels in the output grid should be black.\\\\n59. To make the output, you have to find the colored cell that is surrounded by more colored cells on its north, south, east and west. Then replace this particular 3x3 area with the number two, creating an outlined box and put the color number of that cell which is in the center in the center of the 3x3 area. Turn all the other cells into black.\\\\n60. To achieve the output from the input, locate the cluster of the same color surrounded by black in the input. Replicate this cluster in the central part of the output, replacing colors with red except its center which is replaced with another different color. All other elements of the output grid are black.\\\\n61. To produce the output, you should focus on the red squares from the input. Detect the structured formation of the red squares and place this formation in the exact middle of the grid in the output with the color changed to green. The rest of the grid is left as black.\\\\n62. To make the output grid, first find the vertical belt of colored numbers in the input grid. This should be three numbers in a column. Move the column to the bottom center of the grid (with one cell of buffer from the edges of the grid), and surround it with two columns of red number 2. The rest of the grid is black.\\\\n63. To form the output grid, locate the non-black square that is in the middle row of the grid (3 squares from any edge). Draw a line of the color of this central square from left to right, 3 squares above and below this central point. Leave the other squares black, forming a horizontally-centered rectangle. Ignore all other colors in the grid except the color of the purple square in the middle row in the input.\\\\n64. To make the output, start by finding the position of the first colored cell in every column from top to down. Then replace the row that with 3 cells colored with red in the middle and black in remaining cells. The middle red cell in the row is the color of the first colored cell in that column from the input. All other cells in the grid are black.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "After analyzing the rules, they can be categorized into eight distinct categories based on their similarities:\n\n1.

This would be equivalent to reflecting them vertically across the center of the grey row. The transformed blue cells will replace the grey cells at their new location and the black and grey cells remain in their positions.\\\\n2.

The rows above the row of long grey blocks become completely black, and the blue squares are now grey and integrated into the long grey blocks.\\\\n3.

The locations of the copied blue cells should mirror the locations in the third row.\\\\n5. To make the output, you have to swap the positions of 1(blue) and 5(grey) in the last row. The pattern of 1(blue) in the third row from the top is reflected in the last row but with 5(grey) in the output. The rest remains the same.\\\\n6. To make the output, you have to swap the position of the blue cells in the middle row with the corresponding gray cells in the row above the bottommost one.\\\\n7. To make the output, locate the blue color in the third row and change its position to the fifth row in the same column but make sure to keep it grey where it was black and vice versa. Erase the blue from the third row. The rest of the row should remain as it is.\\\\n8. To make the output, you have to locate the blue cells in the middle of the grid, then replace them with grey cells. Afterwards, replace the bottom row of grey cells with positions that correspond to the former positions of the blue cells with blue cells.\\\\n9. To make the output, you need to replace the blue boxes with the grey color in the very bottom row and replace the grey boxes with blue in the second bottom row. In other words, any blue from the third and fourth rows in the input grid, move it to the corresponding location in the fifth row. Any grey blocks in the fourth row in the input grid, put them in the same location in the third row in the output grid. All other blocks remain unchanged.\\\\n10. To make the output, you have to mirror the third bottom row of the input (the one with blue and black cells) onto the bottom row of the output replacing the grey cells with blue ones only where necessary. Other rows maintain their state from the input to the output. In other words, the grey cells on the bottom row are replaced by the blue cells on the third row from the bottom.\\\\n11. To make the output, you should replace all blue cell rows with black cell rows. Then move all blue cells to the last row, swapping them with the grey cells in their original positions.\\\\n12. To make the output, you need to replace every visible blue block in the fifth row, or the bottom-most part, of the grid with the position of blue blocks from the top part of the grid. More specifically, look at the original position of the blue blocks in third row from top and replace the gray blocks in those respective columns in the fifth row with blue, the rest of the fifth row should remain gray. The top part of the grid including the blue block in the third row from the top should turn into black blocks.\\\\n13. To make the output, you have to swap the positions of the blue and grey boxes in the 4th row counting from above, i.e., reverse the order of blue boxes, while the remaining portion of the grid remains the same.\\\\n14. To make the output, you have to take the blue colored boxes from the middle three rows and move them to the same columns in the bottom row, replacing the grey boxes. If a space in the middle three rows does not have a blue box, leave the grey box in the corresponding column on the last row.\\\\n15. To make the output, you have to replace the blue cells with the position of grey cells in the last row and keep the rest as it is.\\\\n16. You have to mirror the blue boxes to the position inside the grey line to make the output. Replace all the blue boxes with the black boxes (background) outside the grey line.\\\\n17. To make the output, you have to move the blue squares from the third row to the corresponding position in the fifth row. All other squares in the third row become black. The other rows remain the same.\\\\n18. To obtain the output grid from the input, look at the positions of the blue cells - these essentially act as markers. In the output grid, these blue cells are replaced with black cells (i.e., the cells become \\\\\\'empty\\\\\\'), while the cells in the corresponding position in the grey row become blue. All other cells are unchanged. Essentially, the pattern is: blue cells move down from the middle row to the bottom row of grey cells.\\\\n19. To make the output, you have to flip the blue and the grey cells at the bottom grey row. The top two rows and the third and fourth rows from the top are kept black.\\\\n20. To make the output, you have to apply this rule: wherever a blue cell appears above a gray cell, replace it by the gray cell in the bottom row, maintaining the position along the row. All other positions remain as gray cells except the one that turned from blue to gray, which will remain as black cells in between the two gray lines.\\\\n21. The gray line at the bottom reflects the structure of the shapes above it, replacing the black spaces with gray and blue shapes with black. The mirrored image replaces the original shapes in the grid, transforming the originally upper blue shapes into gray shapes within the gray line at the bottom.\\\\n22. To make the output, you have to move the blue cells from the middle row to the corresponding positions in the bottom row, replacing the grey cells there. The blue cells in the middle row then become black, effectively \"moving\" them to the bottom row.\\\\n23. To make the output, you have to swap the positions of the blue and grey blocks from the bottom two colored rows. The top rows remain black.\\\\n24. Apart from the last row which remains grey, one must \"mirror\" the blue squares found in the input grid on this bottom layer of grey squares, creating the same formation of blue squares at the same horizontal locations. Replace the original blue squares with black squares, effectively transferring the blue squares to the last grey row while maintaining their original order from right to left.\\\\n25. To make the output, you have to, first, keep the bottom grey line intact. For the lines above, replace blue squares by black squares and replace the bottom grey squares directly above the blue squares with the blue squares from the respective columns. This transformation could be seen as pulling down the blue squares into the grey line.\\\\n26. To create the output, first step is to copy the top two black lines and the fourth grey line as it. On the last line, replace the blue pixels with grey and vice versa. The transformation involves switching the colors of the blue and grey pixels on the bottom-most row of the grid.\\\\n27. To make the output, you have to move each blue cell (1 in the input grid) from the third row two rows below, to the last row. The destination cell in the last row should be grey (5 in the input grid), and replace that cell in the last row with the blue cell. The blue cell in the third row should then be turned grey.\\\\n28. To make the output, take any blue cells above the gray strip and move them down into the corresponding columns within the gray strip. If a column in the gray strip already has a blue cell, replace it with black.\\\\n29. The grid transformation consists of taking the row of blue cells and replacing them in a mirror-image order in the bottom row of gray cells. At the same time, the row of blue cells is then filled with black cells in the output grid.\\\\n30. The output result is made by copying the blue pattern to the grey line on the bottommost row, keeping the positions of the coloured block same in the row, but the original grey pattern maintain the same. All other cells in the grid stays as they are, including the black cells on the third and fourth row (where the blue and grey patterns were in the input).\\\\n31. To make the output, move any blue dots that appear in the row above the grey line to the corresponding position on the grey line. All other cells remain unchanged.\\\\n32. To make the output, you have to shift the blue (1) cells from the third row (from the top) one row down replacing the corresponding position of the grey cells in the fourth row. At the same time, shift the grey cells which have been replaced from the fourth row to the bottom grey row replacing the corresponding position of the grey cells in the bottom row. The blue cells in the third row (from the top) will remain black (0) after shifting.\\\\n33. To produce the output grid from the input grid, replace each blue cell located in the 3x3 central square of the input grid with a gray cell in the respective column within the bottom row of gray cells. The rest of the grid remains the same.\\\\n34. To make the output, you need to move the blue squares down to take the place of the grey squares in the bottom row, keeping their position in the row consistent. Remove the blue squares from their original position, replacing them with black squares. Everything else should stay as it is.\\\\n35. To make the output, you have to replace each blue square in the last but one row with gray in the corresponding position in the gray row. All other squares in the input grid remains the same in the output grid.\\\\n36. To make the output, you have to mirror the position of 1s into the last row, replacing the corresponding 5s. The third row turns to all 0s. Remaining cells retain their values.\\\\n37. To obtain the output, all blue (1) squares in the third row from the top are changed to black, and the blue squares are instead placed in the bottom-most row, in the exact positions they previously occupied above. All other squares retain their original colors.\\\\n38. To make the output, you have to interchange the positions of blue dots and grey dots. If there is a blue dot at a particular position in the input, that position becomes a black dot in the output. The position of the grey dot in the output is the same as the position of the blue dot in the input. Hence, blue dots and grey dots swap positions in the output grid compared to the input grid.\\\\n39. To make the output, you would have to swap the positions of red and grey shapes from the 3rd row in the last grey row.\\\\n40. To make the output, you have to  replace all the blue squares in the grid with black. The remaining blue squares then move down to replace the grey squares directly beneath them.\\\\n41. To make the output, you have to swap the blue and pink squares. Then, replace the middle part of all gray lines with black squares.\\\\n42. To make the output, you have to mirror the scattered blue dots from above the horizontal line to below the horizontal line, replacing any grey dots they overlap. The rest of the grid should remain as it is.\\\\n43. To create the output, all the blue squares are replaced with the black. Also, the blue squares are replaced in the fourth line with grey squares.\\\\n44. To make the output, you have to replace the blue boxes (representing the number 1) in the central row of the last grey row (representing the 5). This should be done while maintaining the initial position of the blue boxes.\\\\n45. To make the output, first remove all the blue squares from the middle row so it becomes black. Then replace the corresponding grey squares in the bottom row with blue.\\\\n46. To make the output, you have to replace the blue boxes with gray boxes and the gray boxes above the bottom line with black boxes. Finally, put the blue boxes that were initially in the input on the same position as the gray boxes in the bottom line of the output.\\\\n47. To make the output, you have to remove the blue cell(s) from the third row of the grid. Then, in the last row, replace the grey cell(s) at previous positions of the blue cell(s) with blue ones.\\\\n48. To make the output, you have to turn all the blue cells to black except for those mirrored at the yellow row at the bottom. Replace those that aren\\\\\\'t affected into blue cells on the corresponding positions of the yellow row at the bottom, ensuring that the placement is mirrored from the center.\\\\n49. To make the output, you have to change the third row from the bottom to all white cells. Then mirror the previous blue cells progressively from centre to the end onto the bottom grey line.\\\\n50. To make the output, you have to swap the colors between the third and fifth rows. All blue dots become grey and grey dots become blue. All other cells remain black.\\\\n51. To make the output, you have to move the blue line from the middle of the grid to the bottom gray line. All the places where there was blue on the middle line move to the same position on the bottom gray line. The bottom row maintains its original gray color except for the spots that have had blue added to them.\\\\n52. To make the output, remove blue dots from the third row. Then, wherever the blue dots were, replace the grey dots in the bottom line with blue dots. All unchanged cells from the input will be left as they are.\\\\n53. To make the output, you have to replace the blue spots on the 5th line from the top with the grey spots from the fourth line and erase the third line completely making it black.\\\\n54. To make the output, replace the blue boxes in the input grid with black boxes, and then replace the grey boxes in the lowest row of the grid with blue boxes in the same configuration as the replaced blue boxes. The grey boxes remain unchanged in their original positions.\\\\n55. To make the output, you must replace the blue pixels in the grey line at the bottom with the blue pixels in the blue grid in order from left to right, keeping their original position. Empty pixels are ignored.\\\\n56. To make the output, you have to take the blue cells from the middle row and move them to the bottom row, in the corresponding grey cells. The rest of the output grid remains the same.\\\\n57. To make the output, remove the color of the boxes from the row above the grey row (make them black). Then, mirror the color of the boxes in that row onto the corresponding squares of the grey row.\\\\n58. To make the output, you have to replace all blue cells in the third row with black cells and replace the corresponding grey cells in the bottom row with blue. The rest of the grid remains the same.\\\\n59. To make the output, you have to replace every blue shape in the bottom row with the blue shape that was in the same column in the middle row in the input image. The middle row in the output is just filled with black cells. All other cells remain as they were in the input grid.\\\\n60. Move the blue dots from the third row to the last row directly below their original position. After the movement, the third should turn blank while the last row will have both the fuchsia and blue dots.\\\\n61. To make the output, you have to replace the blue dots found in the middle of the grid with black (empty) cells and replace the corresponding grey cells located at the bottom of the grid with blue dots to mirror the initial position of the blue dots above. Everything else remains the same.\\\\n62. To make the output, you have to copy the blue squares from the third row to the place of the gray squares in the last row and vice versa, swapping the positions of the blue and gray squares. The gray squares in the third row should be turned black. The top two rows remain all black.\\\\n63. To make the output, you have to replace the blue cells in the third row with black cells and in the bottom row, at the same positions where there were blue cells in the third row of the input, replace the grey cells with blue cells.\\\\n64. To make the output, you should replace the blue squares in the top rows with black and fill the fuschia row at the bottom with the pattern of blue squares from the top rows. The rest of the squares remain unchanged.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "After analyzing the rules, they can be categorized into eight distinct categories based on their similarities.

To make the output, you have to copy the three rows of colored boxes on the left half of the grid and paste them on the same position on the right half of the grid. Then find the blue box in the right half of the grid, move three positions to the left and paste the copied rows in that position. Also if there are more than one blue box, then paste the colored rows just like a staircase for each blue box.\\\\n2. To make the output, you have to replicate the three colored bars to the right of the gray line, as long as there\\\\\\'s no blue square restricting it. If there is a blue square, the replication of the colored bars resumes after the blue square, except if there is an additional blue square at the far right of the grid, the colored bars will duplicate once more before reaching that blue square.\\\\n3. To make the output, copy the leftmost three cells of each row to the three cells to the right of the grey column. Then, if there is a blue cell in the original location in the row above, copy the first three numbers from that row at the same location of blue cell on right side of grey column. If there is a distinct blue cell multiple steps to the right, copy the corresponding colored number set at that location.\\\\n4. To make the output, for each marked blue cell encountered after grey line, you have to copy the colored shapes from left of the grey line and put them in place of those marked blue cells and their following black cells till the end of the row. Start from topmost colored rectangle when copying. The copying process for each blue cell is done independently, meaning it always starts from the topmost line. Keep everything else the same.\\\\n5. To make the output, you have to replace the black cells after the grey column (to the right) by repeating the pattern in the top 3x3 colored square, based on the positions of the blue cells in the original grid. If there\\\\\\'s a blue cell, replace it with the top 3x3 colored square column by column until you run out of blue cells. If there are no blue cells in a row, keep the cells after the grey column as black.\\\\n6. The transformation involves copying the elements from the horizontal strip at the top, during which each stack or collection of symbols gets replicated 1) To the right of their original location spread across the black or \\\\\\'0\\\\\\' section, at a regular horizontal spacing. The original leftmost symbols are copied first. 2) Just below horizontally under the positions they were copied to 3) There\\\\\\'s an additional vertical duplication of symbols extending further down positionally below the previous copies, but this only happens if the black or \\\\\\'0\\\\\\' block contains a \\\\\\'1\\\\\\'. The copied symbol stack corresponds to the vertical position of the \\\\\\'1\\\\\\' in the black or \\\\\\'0\\\\\\' block.\\\\n7. To make the output, mirror the colored sequence to the right side of the gray line. Copy the same colored sequence whenever a blue square appears to the right of the gray line.\\\\n8. To make the output, copy the left section with the colored cells wherever you see a blue cell in the right section. For single blue cells, copy the left section entirely. But if two adjacent blue cells are observed, then copy and append the left section twice. If there are no blue cells, leave the cells black.\\\\n9. To make the output, you have to copy the first three columns from the left of the grid and paste them immediately to the right of the grey column. Then, wherever there\\\\\\'s a blue square in the black portion of the input grid, paste the first three columns from the left of the grid again over that location. The rest of the grid should remain black.\\\\n10. To transform the input to the output grid, you need to take the first three rectangles and repeat them horizontally where the corresponding rectangles are in the input. If the input grid has a blue cell in the 6th column it means that you need to repeat the pattern on top of it, resulting in 6 blocks instead of 3. Single blue cells in the 12th column indicate that we need to repeat the initial pattern at that spot. All other cells in the output are black by default.\\\\n11. To make the output, you need first to look into the 3x3 square to the left of the 5s column. Then, each blue square on the right side of the input should be replaced by this 3x3 color pattern. Where a horizontal line of blue squares appear, that line should be filled completely with this 3x3 pattern repeated horizontally.\\\\n12. To make the output, you have to repeat the pattern from the left of the grey line (from top to bottom) in the empty black cells to the right of it. The blue cells in the right region act as separators, indicating where to start copying the next row of the pattern from the left region. The copied patterns shouldn\\\\\\'t cross the blue cells. If there\\\\\\'s another blue cell before completing the pattern, the pattern gets restarted. At the same time, the patterns from left region should be copied (as it is) next to the grey line in right region ignoring the blue cells.\\\\n13. To produce the output, copy the 3x3 square onto the black cells directly to the right of the vertical column of cells. Blue cells serve as markers on where to place the copied 3x3 squares. If there are two blue cells on the same row, then the 3x3 square should be copied two more times on that row. Leave the rest of the grid as is.\\\\n14. To make the output, you have to replicate the colored pattern at the left of the grid (ignoring the gray column) towards the right, starting right after the gray column until the end of the grid. However, the number of times the pattern is replicated is dictated by the total number of standalone blue cells. For example, if there are two blue cells, you would replicate the pattern twice, with each replication starting at the location where the blue cells were in the input.\\\\n15. To make the output, you should copy and paste the 3x4 colored rectangle to the cells immediate right of where the blue cells are on the right side. If there are two blue cells in the same column, copy the 3x4 colored rectangle twice into the corresponding positions on the left. Lastly, fill in the remaining empty cells with black.\\\\n16. To make the output, you have to copy the first three column formation of colored cells and replacing the blue cell in the fifth column with the copied colors. After that, look for any blue cells in the remaining columns and replace them with the three-column color formation starting from left. This process is followed from top to bottom row-wise ensuring that the color formation repeats if there are multiple blue cells present in a row.\\\\n17. To make the output, we need to repeat the first 3 columns of the grid (3x3 color grid) where there are blue cells on the right. The copied grid will start from the previous column where the blue cell was. Note that if there are two blue cells in the same row, the copied grid will overwrite the columns that was generated by the first blue cell.\\\\n18. To make the output, you have to reflect the colorful blocks across the grey straight line. The reflection should be filled into black blocks following the grey line while excluding the positions that are filled with blue blocks in input grid.\\\\n19. To make the output, you have to copy the pattern on the left side of the grey line and paste it after the grey line where blue squares are present in the input grid. For rows where there are multiple blue squares, repeat this operation as many times as there are blue squares. The rest of the grid should remain the same as the input grid.\\\\n20. To produce the output grid from the input grid, copy the color blocks from the leftmost columns to the right half of the grid. The first colored block appears after the grey columns, the second appears right after the first one, and the third appears after the last blue spot in column 7. All remaining cells in the grid remain black.\\\\n21. The transformation consists of copying the groups of colored boxes and placing them in places where blue box is encountered in the original grid. The order of colored boxes within each group should be maintained. The copying process is repeated upon each encounter of blue boxes moving from left to right and top to bottom. If the space does not allow the complete group to fit, then just fit whatever can be included.\\\\n22. Using the leftmost 3x3 square and the positions of the blue squares, start to fill the grid after the midline (the line of grey squares) which is consisted of black squares in the input grid according the column positions of the blue squares. Every time, copy the leftmost 3x3 square to the position which is specified by blue in same row. If there are multiple blue squares in the same row, the leftmost 3x3 square should be repeated that amount of times in the output grid\\\\\\'s same row.\\\\n23. To transform the grid, copy each of the coloured squares in the 3x3 block and move them to the corresponding locations in the grid where the blue squares are. If there are multiple blue squares in a line, repeat the 3x3 block colors for each blue square.\\\\n24. To achieve the output from the input, the 1st three colored squares from the left of the stripe are copied everywhere to the right of the stripe. The blue squares are still placed to the right of the stripe and wherever there is a presence of the blue square, the 1st three colored squares are mirrored immediately after the stripe in addition to the right of this mirrored grid (only if there is sufficient space).\\\\n25. To prepare the output from the input, maintain the three wide vertical strip of colors and the gray strip in the middle as it is. In the empty black space to the right of the gray strip, fill the corresponding colors from the vertical strip of colors on the left, and keep the blue color positioning unchanged. Repeat these colors till the right end of the grid. Try to maintain the total blue colors consistent in the output, make repeated strips of the left section colors, but without adding any additional blue colors.\\\\n26. To transform the grid, at each position of blue number in the input grid, you copy the initial series of numbers that exist before the grey column in the input to the black cells after the grey column in the output. This pattern repeats and follows the blue cell as a guide in the input. If there\\\\\\'s no blue cell, that row remains unchanged in the output. The exception is when there are multiple blue cells in the same row. In this case, the sequence repeats from the beginning right after the first copy.\\\\n27. To make the output, you copy the first three columns into the spaces to the right of the grey column. If a row in the input has a blue square after the grey column, fill the row in the output with three copies of the first three columns of its corresponding row. Replace all the blue squares with black squares.\\\\n28. To make the output, in the initial three rows from the top, copy the first few colored cells to the right of the green cell. In the middle three rows, copy the first few colored cells from the top to the right of the green cell. In the last three rows, copy the first few colored cells from the top just after the grid which was copied in the middle section. An exception is the copied grid which has the blue cell , it should follow the rules but since there is a blue cell it must be copied to the end of the output grid in the same row .\\\\n29. The transformation rules consist of mirroring the three top-most colored rows on the left side of the grey line to the right side. The number of times these rows are mirrored depends on the amount of blue cells in that row. If a row on the right side of the grey line contains one blue cell, the corresponding row on the left of the grey line is mirrored once to that row. If there are two blue cells in a row on the right side of the grey line, the corresponding row on the left of the grey line is mirrored twice to the same row on the right side. If there are no blue cells, no mirroring is done.\\\\n30. To make the output, you have to follow the steps below: Look at each cell in the 6th column (column after the column fully filled with 5), if it\\\\\\'s black, copy the corresponding 1x3 grid area from the top left corner (before the column filled with 5) to the columns on the right until you meet a cell in blue or you reach the end of the grid, otherwise, if the cell in the 6th column is blue, continue to the next cell in this column. Do these steps for every cell in the 6th column from the top to the bottom. Leave other cells as is.\\\\n31. To make the output, you have to copy the three color pattern cells and replace the corresponding black cells in rows where a blue cell is present. The color patterns should be added in the same sequence as in the left hand side, repeating through rows.\\\\n32. To make the output, the given colored patterns from the left portion of the grid before the grey column in input, are replicated and placed in the right part of grid after the grey column, by replacing the black cells (0). The positions of these replicated patterns in the right are the same as the positions of the blue boxes (1) in the input. The grey column (5) and anything at right of grey column that is not replaced remains same.\\\\n33. To make the output, you need to the right of the gray vertical line, copy the 3x3 square to the first available positions. If there was a blue cell in this row in the input, after the copied 3x3 square, leave a black cell and then copy the 3x3 square again.\\\\n34. To make the output, you have to copy each block of colored rows found at the first fourth of the grid and paste it on the second fourth of the grid after the grey column. The pattern of the colored blocks should then be also copied into the last three columns of the third fourth of the grid. Given another color doesn\\\\\\'t appear in any of the row blocks, replace it with the block pattern from the first fourth in a cyclical manner. Any remaining cells belonging to the last fourth should then be filled by extending the pattern of the last color block.\\\\n35. To make the output grid, you have to find three consecutive non-black (0) cells to the left of the grey line (number 5) and repeat them to the right of the grey line for each position that has a number one (blue) in its starting position in the corresponding row of the input.\\\\n36. To make the output, you have to copy and paste the initial 3-column color pattern to different sections of the grid where there were only black cells in the input. The copied pattern should be placed just to the right of the grey column, in the middle of the rightmost black cell section (if a blue cell is in this section), and in the rightmost cell of the grid (if a blue cell is in the rightmost cell section).\\\\n37. To make the output, you have to reflect the 3x3 colored square towards the right side of the gray column. This mirrored image will replace the black cells but not where you find blue cells. The blue cells position remain unchanged but retains the color of the underlying image in the mirrored section.\\\\n38. To transform the input grid to the output grid, copy the initial three color patterns on the left of the grey line and paste it right after the grey line at each row for as many blue cells are present in the same row. Repeat this process until the end of the row if there are more than one blue cell.\\\\n39. To make the output, you need to preserve the grey column. Then copy the first three coloured cells of each row to the right of the grey cell in the same row. Repeat these three cells at the fifth and ninth positions to the right of the grey cell.\\\\n40. The blue cells to the right of the yellow line indicate positions in which to mirror the multicolored grid on the left. If there is a blue cell in the second or third column to the right of the yellow line, then mirror the multicolored grid once to fill the first three rows following the yellow line. If there is a blue cell in the last or second-to-last column, then mirror the multicolored grid a second time in the three columns next to the previous mirrored section. If there is no blue cell in a specific column, then leave that column black.\\\\n41. To make the output grid, move the column after the grey line and shift them to the right until they reach the second last column. The pattern of three coloured digits will then be copied from their original position to the empty spaces created. This process is applied from top to bottom in the manner of top three rows, next three rows and the last three rows.\\\\n42. To make the output, the left section is unchanged. Replace the blue cells in the right section with a copy of the 3x3 colored cells matrix from the left section. If there are two blue cells in the same row, replicate the 3x3 colored cells matrix 2 times in that row.\\\\n43. To make the output, you have to take the blue, red, yellow, fuschia, orange, teal, and brown colors from the columns on the far left and duplicate them in the black regions to the right of the grey column. The location of the repeated colors is determined by the blue cells in the input grid. When a blue cell is encountered in the input, repeat the same three column color pattern from the left at that position in the output. If no blue cell is present, the corresponding output cells remain black. Repeat this operation until the grid is filled up or the black region ends.\\\\n44. To make the output, you have to fill in the boxes on the right side with copies of the left side three times. If there is a blue square in the background on the left side, it should be copied only once, after which you continue with the next left side row on the right side. Ignore the single colored column in the middle and keep it the same.\\\\n45. To make the output, you need to repeat the blocks of color, excluding the grey lines, initially on the rights side of the grey lines then into the black section for a total of three repetitions. If a blue square appears within the black section, it should be replaced with the corresponding color block. This pattern should continue until the end of the row.\\\\n46. The transformation rule of the grid from the input to the output works as following: Starting from the grey line, you would see one or more instances of the color set (from top down) appearing to the right of the line, exactly in the same order as they appeared on the original shape orders. The number of the same set of colors replicated to the right depends on the blue colored cells that are on the right side of the grid in the input. For example, in case 1, there are two instances of the color set appearing to the right of the gray line, corresponding to the two blue cells that appeared on the input grid.\\\\n47. 1. Retain the first four columns (columns with index 1-3 and the grey column) of the input grid to the output grid in their original form.  2. Replace all black cells to the right of the grey line in the input grid with the their corresponding row cells (top 3 cells) from the top colored rows in a sequential manner down the rows.    3. When replacing the cells for the rows below the grey line in input grid (which consists of entirely black cells or with one blue cell), make sure to do this not once but twice in a row for each top colored rows simultaneously. This rule applies for every three rows beneath the grey line.\\\\n48. To make the output, you have to repeat the pattern of the 3x3 section, in the blank spaces after the grey line. Particularly, for each row, repeat the colors of the 3x3 section in order, filling up to where the blue cell is in the input. If a second blue cell appears in the input, repeat the pattern once more filling up to where the second blue cell is. If there is no blue cell, don\\\\\\'t put any colors after the grey line.\\\\n49. To generate the output grid, copy the pattern from the first three left-most cells in each row to the respective position in the same row defined by the previous blue cells. This grid transformation maps only to identical cells in each row. If there is no blue cell, the cells remain unchanged. This process is independent and only applies to each individual row, not cumulatively to the whole grid.\\\\n50. To make the output, you have to firstly preserve the given colors on the left and the grey line. But, the right side of the grey line should be filled in with the three colors from the left side, cycling in the same order, for each row. Fill until you reach a blue cell, then leave the rest of the row black. If the row contains multiple blue cells, multiple blocks of color cycles can be present. Each blue cell marks the end of a color cycle block and new one starts after it.\\\\n51. To transform the input into the output, you start by copying the first four columns of the input grid to the output grid. Then, for every occurrence of the number one in the fifth column of the input, replicate the first 3-column color sequence from the top in the same row of the output, until the end of that row. If a row in the input grid does not have a number one in the fifth column, fill the remaining cells in the corresponding row of the output with zeros.\\\\n52. To make the output, you have to copy the series of diagrams to the right side of the gray separation line (in the same respective order), each time a blue point appears in the \\\\\\'repeated pattern\\\\\\' area. This is performed moving each triangle to the right, maintaining the order, each time a blue signal appears. If no blue points appear, the space remains black. The diagram series is also repeated at the end of the blue signaled areas.\\\\n53. The output keeps the image of the input grid, but add copies of the three first columns (before gray separator) to the blank spaces in the rest of the image. The three 3-color lines copies are placed in the same structure and order relative to the position of the blue spot counted from the bottom of the grid. If there is no blue spot in a part of the grid then that part remains blank.\\\\n54. To make the output, you have to repeat the row of colors in the blue-marked locations, maintaining the order of colors. The gray column separates each repetition of the color row.\\\\n55. To make the output, you have to copy the first, second and third columns into positions following the first grey column, replacing black cells. If there is a blue cell in the black area, the three initial columns should also be copied beginning in this row.\\\\n56. To make the output, copy the three multicoloured blocks above the green line to the black spaces below the green line in a vertical direction. The position of these blocks corresponds to the position of the blue blocks in the input. If there is no blue block in the black space, it remains as it is. Repeat the pattern of these blocks in a row if there is more than one blue block in the same row.\\\\n57. To make the output, detect the three types of rows of non-zero numbers at the top of the grid and repeat each row of numbers as they appear from top to bottom in each segment of the grid where the fifth column contains a number \\\\\\'1\\\\\\'. The repetition starts from column five and repeats the sequence within the available columns without truncating the sequence if the available columns are less than the repeating sequence.  If the sequence repeats more than once, leave one column as zero before starting the next repeat of the sequence. If the sequence does not fit the remaining columns, leave them as they are. If the sequence is shorter, leave the remaining columns as they are. The column with the constant series remains unchanged.\\\\n58. The transformation procedure is primarily composed of three parts. First involves replication of initial three color patterns throughout the grid. It is achieved by copying first three columns of each set of three rows and placing at every three columns where \"5\" is not present. In the second part, whenever a blue colored cell (denoted by \"1\") is encountered in the input grid, it triggers the pattern replication in the corresponding output cells of the same row but different columns (where \"5\" is not placed). The third part handles the scenario for multiple blue cells occurrence in a row where pattern replication is required to be extended till the second last column of the row with the same set of patterns.\\\\n59. To make the output, you have to copy the top row of 3 colored boxes and paste it in each black space after the grey column repeating it as many times as indicated by the number of blue cells on the corresponding row. If there is no blue cell on the right side of the grid from the grey column, the space remains black.\\\\n60. To make the output, you have to copy and move each group of number in each of the three rows above the gray column inserted at the 5th, 6th, and 7th positions from the left. For the rows that include blue number (1), the group of numbers is duplicated on the right of the gray column.\\\\n61. To make the output, you have to duplicate the collection of columns on the left of the vertical 5 line, on the right side of this line, to occupy the first available space, then repeat this duplication at every instance of the number 1 right of the vertical number 5 line.\\\\n62. To make the output, you should firstly copy the 4x3 colored pattern on the left cells of the grid to the first three columns of cells right from the \\\\\\'5\\\\\\' series. Then according to the placement of 1\\\\\\'s (blue) in the input grid, you should copy the 4x3 colored pattern to specifically corresponding columns counting from the second segment of zeros towards the right side of the grid. The copying is done column by column from left to right, and doesn\\\\\\'t affect the \\\\\\'5\\\\\\' series and the part of the grid that should remain zeros (black).\\\\n63. To make the output, you have to copy the colored shapes on the left of the grey line, once to its immediate right and then once to the right of the blue boxes on the far right side of the grid. The position where the colored shapes are pasted depends on the presence of the blue box. If a blue box is present in a row on the right, the colored shapes are pasted in the same row starting from column 9.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "Category 1: Copying and pasting colored patterns based on the position of blue cells\nRule: Copy the colored patterns from the left side of the grid and paste them on the right side, starting from the position of the blue cells.

To make the output, you have to shift the bottom half of the grid (below the empty row) upwards until it collides with the structure in the top half of the grid. The red cells replace the blue cells they collide with. All cells left empty following the shift should be filled with black cells (0).\\\\n2. To make the output, you have to replace all blue cells in the top block that match the position of a red cell in the bottom block with a red cell. Replace the original red cell block with a block of black cells. Keep all other cells the same.\\\\n3. To make the output, you have to rotate the bottom half of the pattern to the top, replacing the blue cells where the red line is overlaid, and then clear the bottom half, turning all the cells into black colour.\\\\n4. To make the output, you have to replace blue squares corresponding to the positions of red squares below the black line. If there is a red square at a certain position, the blue square at the same position above the black line is replaced with red in the output. After this, the part below the black line is completely black. All other squares remain as  they are.\\\\n5. To transform the grid, shift the red shape to the black spaces on the blue until the red shape is completely consumed. The shift always happens from bottom to top, replacing blue pixels with red where there are conflicts starting from the lowest row. The leftover space of the red form should then be filled with black.\\\\n6. To make the output, you have to replace numbered cells with red colored cells if there is a black colored cell above it in the same row analogous to falling/gravity. Keep dropping red cells into black ones in the top icon until they can no longer drop. The red cells should replace the blue and black cells they land on until they cannot go any further. Once a red cell has dropped, it will not drop again.\\\\n7. To make the output, you have to flip the grid horizontally but only the non-black portion, with blue portion flipping onto the red portion and red portion flipping onto blue portion. The black cells remains same in their positions.\\\\n8. To make the output, you should first mirror flip the bottom half of the input grid so it aligns with the top half. Then, overlay the flipped bottom half onto the top half. If a blue box from the top half overlaps with a red box from the flipped bottom half, keep the blue box; if a blue box from the top half overlaps with a blank space from the flipped bottom half, change the blue box to red.\\\\n9. Reflect the first half just above the line of black cells onto the second half, turning red pixel into blue where there are any, and maintaining black cells. The result will be a mirrored copy of the upper block, replacing the lower one, where black cells of the upper block are mirrored as black cells and the rest as blue cells. The line of black cells and everything above it remain as they are.\\\\n10. To make the output, you have to replace the blue numbers with red wherever the red number appears in the corresponding position in the bottom half. If the red number doesn\\\\\\'t exist in the corresponding position, the blue number remains the same. The bottom half of the grid is then replaced by black zeroes.\\\\n11. To make the output, replace the top section\\\\\\'s blue squares with red squares found in the same positions in the bottom section (if any). Then, swap the place of the middle and bottom section. The resulting grid should preserve the original blue squares patterns where no red square is placed, and the red squares should replace the blue squares in the same position. Finally, the bottom section should become completely black.\\\\n12. To make the output, you have to replace blue squares at the top block with red squares based on the pattern in the red block at the bottom. Essentially, this involves overlaying the red pattern onto the top block of blue squares and replacing any blue square with a red square where a red square is present in the corresponding position in the red pattern. After this operation, remove the bottom block containing the original red pattern.\\\\n13. To make the output, you have to first consider the first four rows with 1\\\\\\'s from the top of the input grid and replace the corresponding columns in these rows where 2\\\\\\'s are found in the bottom section of the grid. Replicate this to the rest of the rows followed by a black row and then clear the bottom section of the grid (replace it with 0\\\\\\'s).\\\\n14. To generate the output, the rule would be replacing the top part of the blue grid with black where it correspond with red pattern below the line of the input.\\\\n15. The transformation involves swapping the position of the black cells from the top block with the corresponding red cells in the bottom block to form the output block.\\\\n16. To make the output, you have to swap the blue squares of the shape from the top half of the grid with red squares from the bottom half. The shape is essentially mirrored along the horizontal midline of the grid. The red squares take the places of the corresponding blue squares and vice versa.\\\\n17. To make the output, you have to superimpose the red pattern onto the blue pattern replacing the blue cells. After that, \\\\\\'move\\\\\\' the bottom half upwards by the same height as the red pattern, leaving black boxes or empty cells below.\\\\n18. To transform the input into the output, you need to substitute the blue cells with red cells in the upper section, while maintaining the exact pattern. How do we know when to substitute? You need to follow the pattern of the red cells in the lower section of the input grid. Example: if there\u2019s a red cell in the third column of the lower section, you\u2019ll need to substitute the blue cells in the third column of the upper section with red cells etc. Note: the middle grid filled with black cells remains unchanged, and the pattern of red cells in the lower section of the grid disappears after the transformation.\\\\n19. To make the output, move the \"sword\" upwards over the available \"tower\" squares until the \"sword\" tip reaches a non-blue square or the top. Replace any overlapping blue squares with red squares. Any unoccupied squares that were previously occupied by the \"sword\" should revert to black.\\\\n20. To make the output, you should take the red squares from below the black line and position them where there are blue squares above the line. The pattern seems to follow a reflection mechanism tracing the line as its axis; the red squares take the place of the blue squares as if they were reflected around the black line. The previously occupied position of red squares turn black.\\\\n21. The transformation describes a mirroring operation of the red cells on top of the blue cells. Simply take each red cell from the bottom square and place it on corresponding place in top square while leaving its own position and all other empty cells in the bottom as black cells. The red cells overlap the blue cells only if the blue cell is present at the corresponding position in top square else it doesn\\\\\\'t affect the blue cells.\\\\n22. To create the output grid from the input grid, we need to move the red cells from the bottom to the top, replacing the blue cells. The red cells are moved upwards and placed into the top blue block, replacing the blue cells from left to right. After the red cells have been moved upwards, the position in the bottom where the red cell was originally is replaced by a black cell (0). If there is any blue cell at the top that corresponds with a black cell at the bottom, it remains as is. All other (blue cells at the top, red and black cells at the bottom) do not change their positions.\\\\n23. To make the output, move each red square up into the equivalent space in the top blue square area, maintaining its position relative to the black line. This will directly replace a blue square if one is present in the corresponding position, or it will be placed into a black square if no blue square is present. After the red squares have been moved, all squares below the black line become black.\\\\n24. To make the output, you have to compare the squares in the top and bottom half of the grid. If a red square at position[i, j] on the bottom half corresponds to a blue square at the same position on the top half, change that blue square to red. This rule has to be applied for all pairs of corresponding squares in the top and bottom halves. If there is no corresponding red square on the bottom half, leave the blue square in the top half as it is. Finally, fill all squares in the bottom half with black.\\\\n25. To make the output, first, mirror flip the grid horizontally. Then replace each blue square from the top 4x6 rectangle with a red number, if there is a red number directly below it in the corresponding position in the bottom 4x3 rectangle. The result after mirroring will be a blue 4x6 rectangle at the bottom with some squares replaced by red, and the red rectangle completely black.\\\\n26. To make the output, move the red dots from the bottom half to the top half, replacing the black boxes where they correspond. The moved red dots will be placed from left to right and top to bottom in the same order as from top to bottom and left to right in the lower half. After that, remove the dots from the bottom half, replacing them with black boxes.\\\\n27. To make the output, you have to swap the blue cells that are in the same positions as the red cells below the black dividing line to the top pattern. This means the grid is divided into a top and bottom half and the cells in the red pattern on the bottom half are selectively moved to the corresponding positions on the top half, replacing the blue cells there.\\\\n28. To make the output, you first take the red line from the bottom part of the grid and place it on the blue pattern. The second step is to replace the blue pattern where the blue and red colors intersect with teal. This means only the intersecting blue squares in the pattern are replaced by teal, the rest of the blue squares remain the same. The bottom part of the grid where the red line was initially is replaced with black squares.\\\\n29. The transformation involves flipping the input grid along the line formed by \\\\\\'4\\\\\\' boxes. In the transformed grid, the \\\\\\'2\\\\\\' replaces \\\\\\'0\\\\\\' in the upper half and vice versa. Note that the \\\\\\'1\\\\\\' boxes in the upper rectangle would remain the same. The transformation essentially mirrors the feature of the lower half of the input grid onto the top half while transforming \\\\\\'2\\\\\\' to \\\\\\'1\\\\\\' and vice versa.\\\\n30. To generate the output, replace the empty cells (black cells) with red cells in the blue box \\\\\\'1\\\\\\' that matches exactly the shape and position of the red stripe in the lower part of the input grid. Rest of the grid remains unchanged. Then remove the red stripe.\\\\n31. The transformation pushes the red \"2\" symbols up into the middle of the grid, replacing blue \"1\"s or black \"0\"s, then the remaining top part of the cells, which the red \"2\"s have just left, become black \"0\"s. The overall effect is as if the red \"2\"s are being moved upward. To be precise: - If a red \"2\" is in a column and there are blue \"1\"s above it in that column, then swap the position of the red \"2\" with the furthest blue \"1\" above it. - If a red \"2\" is in a column and there are no blue \"1\"s above it, but there are black \"0\"s above it in the column, then swap the red \"2\" with the black \"0\" furthest above in the column. - All the cells that the red \"2\"s have just left become black \"0\"s. The rest of the cells have the same colors as the input.\\\\n32. To make the output, move the red blocks from below the yellow line to exactly the same places above the yellow line where there are black blocks. As a result, the places where the red blocks were originally are now black.\\\\n33. To make the output, you have to shift the pattern of red cells in the bottom half to superimpose the pattern on top of the blue cells in the top half. In squares where both the red and blue cells overlap, render the square red. After placing the red cells in the top half, the bottom half should be filled with black cells.\\\\n34. To make the output, you have to replace every black square in the top section with a red square if there is a red square in the corresponding position in the bottom section. Then move the whole bottom section (the red squares on a black background) upwards by the number of rows in the middle section (the purely black rows). Fill the rest of the grid with black squares.\\\\n35. To generate the output grid, slide the red pattern upwards to replace the blue pattern by maintaining the shapes but replacing blue with red. The slide is such that the red pattern is directly beneath the blue pattern without changing the cell colors. The process stops when the blue pattern is entirely replaced by red. The rest of the grid below the red pattern is filled with black.\\\\n36. To make the output, you have to replace the black squares in the top half grid which vertically align with red squares in the bottom half grid with red squares. Then remove all the red squares from the bottom half of the grid and replace them with black squares. The remaining black squares in the top half stay as originally positioned.  This process creates a rectangular grid with the top half having more red squares with the bottom half all in black.\\\\n37. To make the output, you have to replace the blue boxes with red wherever the blue and red coincide in the same column. After the replacement, erase the original row of red boxes. All the remaining boxes in the grid stay as they are.\\\\n38. To make the output, you have to take the red squares from the portion at the bottom and move them upwards, filling the black squares in the blue region, beginning from the middle gap also replacing the blue squares where necessary until the red squares are used up. When there are no more red squares to be moved, leave the rest of the squares untouched. If any black squares still remain in between the resultant blue and red portion, leave them as black. As a result, the squares which were previously red at the bottom become black.\\\\n39. The transformation involves replacing blue squares in the top portion of the grid with red ones, following a certain condition. If a blue square corresponds directly (in the same position) to a red square in the bottom portion, change the blue one into red. The red squares in the bottom grid are then replaced with black squares, resulting in an empty bottom portion in the final output. The rest of the blue squares in the top portion and the black squares remain unchanged.\\\\n40. The transformation involves moving the red cells arranged in the bottom half of the input grid to the corresponding positions in the upper half of the grid where there are blue cells. In the second half of the grid the red cells are replaced by black cells. The equivalent to lifting and superimposing red cells on blue cells in the upper half of the grid only if the position that the red cells occupy in the lower half of the grid aligns with the position of a blue cell in the top half.\\\\n41. To make the output, the transformation involves replacing the black cells in the top rectangle with the color from the bottom of the grid that\\\\\\'s in the same column. The bottom half of the output should mirror the top half ignoring the three distinct colored cells which should be black in the output.\\\\n42. To transform the input grid into the output grid, we slide the second section of the input grid up into the first section so that the red cells replace the black cells in the upper section. This would result in uplifting the lower red cells to the upper black cells of the first section where the column numbers match. The remaining cells of the lower section turn black whereas the vacant cells in the upper section remain black.\\\\n43. To make the output, you have to swap the blue and red portions of the grid. The blue shape must relocate to the exact position of the red squares occupying their previous space. The intervening space between the top of the grid and the beginning of the red squares should be filled up with blue squares from the top and the rest should be filled with black squares. The entire bottom portion should be filled with black squares.\\\\n44. To get the output, move the line of red squares from the bottom half of the grid to the middle of the blue space in the top half, replacing the blue squares they overlap with. If the position was black in the blue space, the red square should also become black. After moving, remove the red squares from their original position.\\\\n45. To make the output, you have to move the red line (2) from the lower half, bringing it upwards until it meets the lowest row of the blue pattern. The red line (2) should replace the blue squares (1) where it overlaps with them. The bottom half should then be filled with black squares (0).\\\\n46. The transformation can be described as mirroring the pattern created by the red cells in the lower half of the input grid onto the blue cells in the top half of the grid, by replacing blue cells in the same positions as red cells with red cells. To be precise, for each red cell in the lower half of the grid, replace the corresponding cell in the top half - counted from the separating black line - with a red cell, if that cell was previously blue. All the red cells in the lower half of the output grid are replaced by black cells.\\\\n47. To make the output, you have to slide the red pattern up into the blue region, filling in the gaps, and keeping the original gaps in the blue pattern as they are. Afterwards, the lower region that originally held the red becomes empty.\\\\n48. To make the output, move all non-black cells from the bottom half to the corresponding positions in the top half. The cells in the top half are overwritten only if the corresponding cell in the bottom half is not black. After the move, all cells in the bottom half transform into black.\\\\n49. To make the output, you have to move the red squares to the corresponding location in the top rectangle. The blue square moved by red should turn into red.\\\\n50. To make the output, you have to first invert the entire image, so that the blue pattern is at the bottom and the red line is at the top. After inverting, replace the blue squares in the positions where there were black squares initially with red color. The single black square in the blue region should remain black, and the surrounding squares become red. The red line should become black. The remaining blue color pattern (if any) and the black squares remain the same.\\\\n51. The output grid is generated by shifting the red pattern on the bottom half of the input grid upward, replacing the blue pattern. Any blue block replaced by a red block changes to red, black blocks remain as black, and any other blue blocks get replaced with black.\\\\n52. To generate the output from the input, look at the position of red dots at the bottom of the grid and replace the correspondingly positioned blue squares at the top with the red squares. The rest of the squares in the grid remain the same.\\\\n53. To make the output, you have to exchange the positions of red and blue cells according to these rules:   1. When there are red cells on the bottom part, move these cells to the same position on the top part, but replace them with the blue cells (if exists) first.  2. When there\\\\\\'s no red cell in the corresponding position on the bottom part, keep the blue cells as they are.  3. Remove the red cells from the bottom.\\\\n54. To make the output, we need to slide the row of red cells upwards until they bump into the row of blue cells. The blue cells that overlap with red cells turn to red. All cells below the resulting row of red cells are turned black to clear the bottom space.\\\\n55. The transformation pattern involves taking the red square from the last part of the bottom half and pasting it in the top part where we have a black square in the blue pattern. This copy-pasting has to be done column by column, from bottom to top of the upper half of the grid. The lower half of the grid is left as zeroes once the red patterns have been moved.\\\\n56. To make the output, you have to perform an operation that reflects the red squares into the blue square region. The reflection is a vertical flip operation conducted over the horizontal black line in between the blue and red squares. This operation turns the blue squares into red whenever the flip causes a blue square to overlap with a red square.\\\\n57. To make the output, you have to shift the red cells from the bottom half of the grid into the corresponding positions in the top half\\\\\\'s blue pattern by replacing the black cells with the red cells. The red cells shifted from their original positions are then replaced with black cells, resulting in an output grid that has the top half with blue, red, and black cells following a specific pattern, and the bottom half consisting entirely of black cells.\\\\n58. To make the output, you need to shift the bottom 4x10 red cell matrix upwards to overlay on the blue cell matrix. Where there are blacks in the lower half of the blue matrix, replace those cells with red. In the remaining parts (the lower most part), fill the grid with black cells.\\\\n59. To make the output, swap the sections of the grid divided by the middle row of 0\\\\\\'s. Any empty spaces (black cells) in top section are filled with the pattern of the cells in the bottom section and vice versa. The cells in bottom part of output grid are entirely black if there are no cells to switch from the top part of input grid.\\\\n60. To transform the grid, alternate rows of blue ones and red twos starting from the top blue row towards the bottom of the grid. The transformation is such that the first blue row remains the same, then every red row from the bottom starts taking up the position of the next blue row from the top. Similarly, the red row which just got replaced by a blue one moves up to take the place of the next blue row. This continues for all red and blue rows. All other cells remain black.\\\\n61. To make the output, you should replace all the blue squares in the upper rectangle that are aligned (vertically) with red squares in the lower part with red squares. After transferred, red squares from the lower part should turn into black squares.\\\\n62. To make the output, you have to flip the blue and red parts of the grid, replacing the rows that contain black cells with rows from the red part of the grid and vice versa. Moreover, the output should also replace existing blue cells with red cells within that part of the grid where blue and red cells are present respectively in the input.\\\\n63. To make the output, the red boxes in the bottom square move up into the black boxes of the top square. When the red box hits a blue box, it stops moving up. All the boxes below the top-most red box become black in the output.\\\\n64. The transformation happens as follows: All bottom-half red cells are moved to their symmetrical position in the upper half. If the upper cell is blue, they combine to form a yellow cell. After the transformation, all cells that are not changed become black.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "Category 1: Shifting and Replacing\n1.

To make the output, you have to extract and essentially downscale the 5x5 grid with the colored plus sign structure which located in the top left quarter of the original input grid. The center of the plus sign is placed in the center of the 3x3 grid in the output and the outer points of the plus sign structure are placed in corresponding corner of the output grid.\\\\n2. To make the output, you have to locate the three squares surrounding single black square both vertically and horizontally then form 3x3 grid from combination of these. Top and bottom squares will form first and third row in the output grid and middle square will be in the second row. Make sure that the sequence in which these squares appear in the input is maintained while placing in the output grid.\\\\n3. To make the output, you have to only observe the pattern of the first colored diagonal after the black row. Draw this pattern in the output grid. The position and spacing among colored squares in the diagonal is translated into the output grid with proportion scaled down such that it fits the 3x3 grid.\\\\n4. To make the output, concentrate on the plus symbol in the bottom half of the input grid. The color used in this symbol will be the color for the output grid. Create the same plus symbol in a 3x3 grid using that color.\\\\n5. To make the output, you need to locate the higher (or the first that appears in case of a tie for the top position) formation in the input grid that is fully formed, i.e., it has the 5 dots following the described configuration, and copy the formation to the output grid. Keep in mind that the positions are considered from left to right, top to bottom. Since the grid only contains black cells and cells of the color of the selected formation for the output, treat the other cells as black cells.\\\\n6. To make the output, you have to locate the upper left colored square zone and create a 3x3 box from same colored squares. The resting position is similar to the shape of a cross where the colored squares form a connected set vertically and horizontally in middle row and column respectively while the corners are black.\\\\n7. To make the output, you have to locate the color blocks in the input grid. The output grid will have the color of the first color block in the input. The colored cells of the output grid correspond to the second color block in the input. The arrangement of the color in the output grid is a 3x3 grid in a pinwheel pattern with the corner and center cells filled.\\\\n8. To make the output, you have to pick the first colored square that appears in the grid and create a similar version in a 3x3 form in the output. So if the first square is teal, replicate the teal square pattern in the 3x3 output. If it was red, replicate the red square in 3x3 form.  We can ignore the other square, as the first one encountered determines the output if both the color and the shape of the square are the same.\\\\n9. To make the output, you have to extract the middle 3x3 grid from the colored shape in the middle of the input grid. The pattern shown in the 3x3 colored shape in the middle is replicated in the output.\\\\n10. To make the output, it is necessary to capture the shape formed by the color cells in the top left quadrant of the input grid and replicate this shape on a 3x3 grid. Ignore all other cells and any other colors, the output only captures the shape pattern of the first non-black color encountered in the top left quarter of the input image.\\\\n11. The output grid is a smaller transformation of the colored regions in the top area. It maintains the arrangement of the colored points into three columns, with  color transitions maintained diagonally. In the case where there are two same numbers in the middle region, the same color transition is picked in the output.\\\\n12. To make the output, you have to look for the cross structure that appears directly above the red cross in the input grid. The color of this cross will form the output cross in the 3x3 grid. If there is no cross above the red one in the input grid, the output cross will be all black.\\\\n13. To make the output, you have to first locate the largest square of colored cells (not including black) in the original grid. Choose the color of this square. Then in the same grid, find the largest square of the same color cells. These largest squares should not overlap and share any cell. The output grid should be the arrangement of these same-colored cells.\\\\n14. To make the output, you have to focus on the figures that appear in the middle of the input grid. Once located, you have to place them in the output grid using the same color for the figures that are drawn.\\\\n15. To make the output, you have to zoom in on the pattern created by the dominant color (color appearing in higher quantity). The exact pattern configuration is one cell colored at the center row and the top & bottom row are completely colored, surrounded further by empty (black) cells.\\\\n16. The transformation takes the 3x3 square of numbers located in the top middle or bottom middle of the input grid, and outputs it as is. If there are two squares in the grid, take the one that is not entirely black.\\\\n17. To make the output, you have to find the smallest cross-shaped figure that is not black and replicate it in the output. If there are multiple smallest cross-figures of the same size, take the cross-figure of the color that appears first in the input when reading from left to right and top to bottom. If no cross-figure is found, the output is a 3x3 grid of black cells.\\\\n18. To make the output, you have to find the triplet colored squares in the input grid arranged in a vertical line and transform it into a cross (a 3x3 grid with the middle row and middle column having the color of the original triplet squares, and the corners being black).\\\\n19. To make the output: For each color, there is a corresponding 3x3 grid in the input that contains that color. The colored grid forms a diamond shape surrounded by black. The output grid is the same as this diamond shaped grid for each color.\\\\n20. To make the output, you have to locate the colored cross pattern in the grid, copy its arrangement and replace any color with the one found in the cross pattern. The central cell of the output is always the color used in the cross pattern while all black cells in the cross are translated as black in the output.\\\\n21. To make the output, you have to identify subgrids in the input grid that are 3x3 and contain the color blocks arranged in the formation of a plus sign in one color. The output is this 3x3 subgrid.\\\\n22. To make the output, you have to identify the pattern of colored squares within the second section of the grid (below the first black line and above the second). This pattern should then be copied onto the output grid in the respective colour.\\\\n23. To make the output, you need to find a 3x3 square in the input grid which is the common part in each color formation. This 3x3 grid is located where the middle row of the top formation meets with the middle row of the bottom formation, and should be the same color as the formations. In simple terms, we overlay the 3x3 sections of each color formation on top of each other, the common color carried over into output is the result.\\\\n24. To make the output, you have to locate the two 3x3 colored grids inside the large grid. Notice that one of the colored grids is slightly bigger than the 3x3 size but formed by repetition of a 3x3 grid. For each cell in the colored grid, if either of the corresponding cells in the two colored grids are colored (not black), then the corresponding cell in the output should be colored. If both corresponding cells in the two colored grids are black, then the corresponding cell in the output should be black. The color used in the output grid is the color used in the smaller 3x3 colored grids.\\\\n25. To make the output, you need to find the X shape above the yellow line and make the corresponding cells in the output grid the same color as the X shape from the input grid. You do the exact same thing for the X shape below the line. If any conflicts arise (i.e. a cell belongs to both X shapes), make that cell in the output grid red.\\\\n26. To make the output, you have to extract the digit forming the diamond-like pattern in the top part of the grid, excluding the boundary black cells. Are present in a 3x3 grid, maintaining their original locations.\\\\n27. To create the output, you have to extract the 3x3 pattern from the input grid that both horizontally and vertically is directly at the center of the pattern with the most amount of cells that are not black. Shapes are repeating multiple times in the input grid, but only the one in the center applies to be in the output.\\\\n28. To make the output, look at the grid as split into nine equally sized squares (3x3). Take the color that appears most frequently in each square section of the larger 14x14 input grid. Assign it to the corresponding slot in the 3x3 output grid, designing a miniature version of the original grid color distribution. If there\\'s a tie for the most frequent color, it\\'s consistently replaced by a black square (0).\\\\n29. To get the output grid, find the largest square made of the same color in the input grid (ignoring black). If there are multiple largest squares of the same size, take the one at the top. If there is still a tie, take the one on the left. Copy this square to the output grid, keeping the colors. If the square is larger than 3x3, center it in the grid and truncate it to 3x3.\\\\n30. To make the output, you have to reduce the non-black diamond shapes in the input grid of one color into a diamond shape in the output, retaining the color of the original diamond. Each color present in the input grid will have its own separate output, retain only the output provided in the middle of the grid, if any. If there\\'s no colored figure in the middle of the input grid, the output should fully be black.\\\\n31. To make the output, one needs to identify the square or rectangle in the input grid with the color that is repeated in two such areas. Once these rectangles or squares are identified, recreate the inner 3x3 pattern from these areas in the output grid. This pattern consists of the color within the identified areas forming a diamond shape in the output.\\\\n32. To transform the grid, simply isolate the top left quadrant (excluding the grey dividing line cells), shrink it down to a 3x3 to form the output grid.\\\\n33. To make the output, you have to find the diamond shaped formation in the input grid and transfer it to the output grid exactly as is, forming a 3x3 grid. All other cells are left black in the output grid. The diamond can be located anywhere in the input grid and can be of any color.\\\\n34. To make the output, you have to identify the colour that appears in a shape of 3x3 in the input, spanning across different sections of the input. The resultant 3x3 coloured shape in the input becomes the output. In case of multiple matches, use the first one going from top to bottom and from left to right.\\\\n35. To make the output grid, you need to find the color in the middle of the \\'X\\' pattern in the input grid. The output will be a \\'X\\' pattern with the found color on a 3x3 grid.\\\\n36. To make the output, for each \\'+\\' shape color in the input grid, you have to create a corresponding 3x3 grid where the \\'+\\' shape is painted with the same color. Ignore the \\'x\\' shape. So, the color of \\'x\\' shape in the input doesn\\'t affect the output.\\\\n37. To make the output, you have to identify the colored plus figure within the grid and represent this in a condensed 3x3 grid. The center of the plus becomes the center of the 3x3 grid, the vertical and horizontal lines of the plus correspond to the respective lines on the 3x3 grid. Everything else is black.\\\\n38. The output grid replicates the pattern of the largest input color (number) in the grid. If you see a teal hourglass in the input, the output is an hourglass of teal. If you see a patch of grey numbers in the input, the output replicates the colour and pattern of those grey digits in 3x3 format. If there is a red symmetric figure, the output replicates the shape of that red symmetric figure.\\\\n39. The transformation involves identifying the mirrored shape of \\'8\\' or teal and copying it into a 3x3 grid. So, to make the output, you have to find the pattern of the teal squares(8) and translate it into a new smaller grid. Ignore any other color and the inverted pattern.\\\\n40. To get to the output from the input, consider only the pattern, from the initial input grid, which is located the furthest to the right and the furthest to the bottom. Copy it and place it in the corresponding output grid. The pattern that is replicated is emphasized by a cluster of colored cells, in the form of a \\'Cross\\' or \\'Plus\\' sign. All the rest of the cells in the grid are not considered in the transformation process and are thus disregarded.\\\\n41. To make the output, you have to locate the cross-like shape (either horizontal or vertical) of a color close to the center of the grid. You then need to take the center cell of the shape and its neighboring cells within the shape, both in horizontal and vertical direction, and place them in corresponding positions on the 3x3 output grid. If a cell within the shape on the input is black, it remains black in the output. The rest of cells outside of the shape, either in the input grid or the output grid, is black.\\\\n42. The transformation involves the translation of each colored design separately. Take the 3x3 square that does not contain black pixels in each design. The position of the colored blocks in the translated 3x3 square will form one colored block in the output grid The central colored block will maintain its color in the input to the output. The rest of the blocks on the positions (first and last row/column) which have the other two colors will be counted as a single color and make up the corresponding positions in the output with this single color. Repeat this process for all colored designs and each time fill the next fuchsia colored pixel in the output grid.\\\\n43. To make the output, you have to compress the entire colored section of the input grid. Compare colored sections and transform the larger 7x7 sections of the input grid into 3x3 sections in which each cell takes the color of the majority of the corresponding cells in the input section, effectively shrinking them.\\\\n44. To make the output, you have to identify the intersecting digit pattern in the grid and render them into 3x3 form. The intersecting pattern is a square made up of matched number of the same digit. This square pattern has its center made up of the same digit as its sides, and black spaces at the corners. Focus at the visible color-coded digit and ignore the black or zero digits. Resize and replicate this colored digit pattern in the output.\\\\n45. To make the output, you have to take the color from the top diamond shape and form a single 3x3 diamond pattern, omitting the black cells.\\\\n46. To make the output, you have to find the largest/most central square of colored cells in the input grid and replicate it at the same position in the output (scaling the output as necessary). The rest of the cells are black. In the given examples, the transformation takes the central cross-shaped tile of color (teal, red, yellow) in the grid and mirrors it as the output. All other elements from the input are ignored. The output will always be a cross shape of the same color.\\\\n47. To transform, look for the colored lines or symbols, which form a particular pattern where the colored elements are present forming a diamond-like shape in the central part of the grid. Take this pattern and isolate it, and keep the relative color of the elements same in the output. Ignore all other parts of the grid that do not fit into the pattern. The output grid will be this isolated pattern and should preserve all relative color from the input.\\\\n48. To make the output, you have to locate the square that is at the centre of the input grid. The center square of this coloured shape\\'s color becomes the colour for all of the cells of the 3x3 output grid. Then, map the squares that are in the same positions as the output grid. If a cell is black in the input grid\\'s shape, the corresponding cell in the output grid remains the already chosen colour. If a cell is coloured in the input grid\\'s shape, the corresponding cell in the output grid becomes black.\\\\n49. To make the output, you have to take the respective color in each two-D array and make a 3x3 grid with the same pattern as in the input respectively, but with black cells (0) instead of the empty cells. Keep in mind black cells are the backgrounds. So, first output grid will be small 3x3 grid with Teal cells (8), second output grid will be small 3x3 grid with Red cells (2) and third output grid will be small 3x3 grid with Fuschia cells (6). The cells of the respective color form a plus (+) sign in the 3x3 grid.\\\\n50. For each pair of symmetrical squares, find the corresponding color and put it in the output grid. The color in the upper square goes to the top, the color in the right square goes to the right. So the main diagonal always contains the color from the squares on the top and right side of the input grid.  If both squares have the same color, it will go in the middle.\\\\n51. The transformation involves centering the shapes from each quadrant into the middle of the grid. The shape takes the color of the first non-black cell starting from the top-left corner and moving towards the center. If there is no colored cell in a quadrant, the corresponding cell in the result will be black. If the quadrant is filled with different colored cells, the color of the first cell encountered should be used.\\\\n52. To make the output, you have to find the central 3x3 colored pattern which repeats inside the colored arrows and use that as the output. The black square in the middle of the pattern represents the direction of arrow pointing in.\\\\n53. To make the output, the 5x5 square maps to the 3x3 output grid by skipping the outermost cells and copying the remaining content.\\\\n54. To make the output, you have to identify the center cluster represented by the numbers on the diagonal of the larger grid and shrink it down to the 3x3 size in the middle of the grid, keeping the shape constant. The center of the cluster will become the center of the output grid and the cells diagonally adjacent to it will take on the color of the cells diagonally adjacent to the center in the cluster, making a plus sign pattern. The rest of the cells remain black.\\\\n55. To make the output, you have to identify the color of the cross shape that is located more to the top on the grid (the grid can be thought to be divided in two halves, top and bottom, separated by the middle colored line). This color will be used to fill the output grid forming a smaller cross with the same color.\\\\n56. To make the output, you have to first identify the unique, dominant colored shape within the large grid. The dominant color should another color (colored value) except black or grey (0 or 5). This colored shape is often an \\'X\\' shape, a cluster of the same colored squares in a specific pattern. Then within a 3x3 grid, reproduce this pattern using the identified color. Always keep the middle of the 3x3 grid as the dominant color regardless of the pattern inside the large grid.\\\\n57. To make the output, you have to remove all the other elements in the grid aside from the solid cross or plus (+) pattern found within the original colour square. The pattern is comprised of a center square and its directly adjacent squares on all four sides.\\\\n58. To make the output, you have to locate the colored diamond shape or shapes in the original grid. The color of the diamond shape becomes the color for the output grid. The output grid is a smaller 3x3 version of the diamond shape seen in the input grid. If there are multiple diamonds, pick the color that occupies the lowest part grid. If they occupy the same row, pick the color on the right.\\\\n59. To create the output from the input, extract the central pattern of the colored cells (3x3 region) from the upper and lower coloured sections. The color of the cells in the output grid is the same as that of the extracted pattern in the input.\\\\n60. In the transformation process, select the middle figure from each non-black section (ignoring the repeated rings of black). Capture each figure - maintaining their colour - and fit them into the output grid, ensuring that the same colour corresponds to each row.  For instance, the first figure (color) from the top gets positioned in the first row of the output grid and so on. Following this pattern, reproduce the colors in their respective positions and maintain a grid spacing similar to the input grid.\\\\n61. The pattern involves extracting the main colored cluster that is mirrored in the input grid (identical clusters but appearing only at opposite sides of the grid). It then scale down these colors into a shape that fits a 3x3 grid, whereby the major color forms an X shape and a common minor color in the center.\\\\n\"}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "Category 1: Rules involving the extraction of a specific pattern from the input grid\n- Rule 1\n- Rule 3\n- Rule 9\n- Rule 10\n- Rule 22\n- Rule 26\n- Rule 27\n- Rule 33\n- Rule 39\n- Rule 44\n- Rule 45\n- Rule 53\n- Rule 59\n- Rule 61\n\nNew Rule: To make the output, you have to identify a specific pattern in the input grid, scale it down, and replicate it in the 3x3 output grid, maintaining the original color and arrangement.\n\nCategory 2: Rules involving the extraction of a specific color from the input grid\n- Rule 4\n- Rule 7\n- Rule 8\n- Rule 12\n- Rule 20\n- Rule 24\n- Rule 48\n- Rule 55\n- Rule 58\n\nNew Rule: To make the output, you have to identify a specific color in the input grid, and use this color to create a specific pattern in the 3x3 output grid.\n\nCategory 3: Rules involving the extraction of a specific shape from the input grid\n- Rule 2\n- Rule 6\n- Rule 18\n- Rule 21\n- Rule 34\n- Rule 35\n- Rule 36\n- Rule 37\n- Rule 40\n- Rule 41\n- Rule 47\n- Rule 52\n- Rule 57\n\nNew Rule: To make the output, you have to identify a specific shape in the input grid, and replicate this shape in the 3x3 output grid, maintaining the original color and arrangement.\n\nCategory 4: Rules involving the extraction of a specific position from the input grid\n- Rule 5\n- Rule 16\n- Rule 17\n- Rule 32\n- Rule 50\n- Rule 51\n\nNew Rule: To make the output, you have to identify a specific position in the input grid, and replicate the color and arrangement of this position in the 3x3 output grid.\n\nCategory 5: Rules involving the extraction of a specific size from the input grid\n- Rule 13\n- Rule 29\n- Rule 43\n- Rule 49\n\nNew Rule: To make the output, you have to identify a specific size in the input grid, and replicate this size in the 3x3 output grid, maintaining the original color and arrangement.\n\nCategory 6: Rules involving the extraction of a specific sequence from the input grid\n- Rule 11\n- Rule 14\n- Rule 15\n- Rule 23\n- Rule 28\n- Rule 30\n- Rule 31\n- Rule 42\n- Rule 46\n- Rule 54\n- Rule 56\n- Rule 60\n\nNew Rule: To make the output, you have to identify a specific sequence in the input grid, and replicate this sequence in the 3x3 output grid, maintaining the original color and arrangement.\n\nCategory 7: Rules involving the extraction of a specific number from the input grid\n- Rule 19\n- Rule 25\n- Rule 38\n- Rule 44\n\nNew Rule: To make the output, you have to identify a specific number in the input grid, and replicate this number in the 3x3 output grid, maintaining the original color and arrangement.\n\nCategory 8: Rules involving the extraction of a specific figure from the input grid\n- Rule 28\n- Rule 30\n- Rule 31\n- Rule 34\n- Rule 35\n- Rule 36\n- Rule 37\n- Rule 40\n- Rule 41\n- Rule 47\n- Rule 52\n- Rule 57\n\nNew Rule: To make the output, you have to identify a specific figure in the input grid, and replicate this figure in the 3x3 output grid, maintaining the original color and arrangement.", "('[{\\'role\\': \\'system\\', \\'content\\': \\'You are an expert natural language parser.

For each category, synthesize the rules into a single, specific rule that combines the ideas of all rules in that category, while clearly differentiating it from the other categories.\\\\nThe new rule should be as specific as possible, following the format of the given rules.\\\\nThe new rule should be applicable without any information from the original rules - i.e. it should be standalone.\\\\n\\\\nRules:\\\\n1. To make the output, you have to maintain the colored squares\\\\\\' four corners and make the inner cells of the square black for each color. Every other part of the input grid remains the same in the output grid.\\\\n2. To make the output, you have to remove the central chunk of colored rectangles, keeping only the border/frame to form a hollow rectangle of that color. The portions that are not part of these rectangles (i.e. the black spaces) remain unchanged.\\\\n3. To make the output, you have to focus on the colored rectangular boxes. All you have to do is transform the full colored rectangles into essentially rectangles with empty centers, maintaining only the edge of the original rectangle i.e., adjacent cells within the original shape that share a side with an empty cell in the input, should remain colored, every other cell should be turned into a black (empty) cell. This will give the appearance of a hollow box in the output where there was a solid box in the input. Any cell outside these colored shapes maintain their original color or lack of it.\\\\n4. To make the output, turn the inner cells of each color shape into black, thus converting each shape into a rectangular color border.\\\\n5. For each colored rectangle, keep the exterior border untouched. Then change the color of the interior region to black, keeping the original colors only at the vertical middle line.\\\\n6. To transform the grid, replace the inner part of each color square on the grid, regardless of its size, with black. The perimeter of each square should remain the same color. The rest of the grid should remain black.\\\\n7. To make the output, you have to keep the colorful blocks on the edges while converting the inner block cells to black, making them look like borders around a black rectangle, if the block height is more than 2, else leave it the same.\\\\n8. To make the output, you have to examine each individual square or rectangular shape. For each rectangle, remove any color in the middle, leaving only the perimeter of the shape. In other words, turn all cells that make up the interior of each rectangular shape to black, while leaving the cells that make up the boundary untouched.\\\\n9. To make the output, you have to create a hole in the middle of each filled rectangle. The hole must be formed by changing the numbers in the central cells to zeros, leaving only a one-cell width border of the original rectangle\\\\\\'s number. If the area of the rectangle is less than or equal to 16 (4x4 cells), keep it the same. This transformation can be thought of as deflating each of the rectangles in the input grid in such a way that the deflated rectangle still has the dimensions of the original rectangle but now consists of only a thin border of colored cells and a zero-filled interior.\\\\n10. To make the output, consider only the square-shaped areas in the grid. If an area is 4x4 or larger, delete the inner portion, leaving a colored perimeter of width 1. However, for any square-shaped area that is smaller than 4x4, leave it as is. Fill the remaining black cells as they are. It\\\\\\'s essentially converting the filled square-shaped color zones into hollow color square zones for larger squares while preserving the smaller color zones.\\\\n11. For each colored rectangle in the input, form a smaller rectangle of the same color within the original one by replacing the inner cells with a border of black cells, while maintaining the outside border of the rectangle. The width and height of the smaller rectangle are reduced by 2 cells on each side, so that you are left with a border of the same color with width 1 cell. If forming a smaller rectangle is not possible due to the size of the original rectangle, then leave it as is.\\\\n12. To make the output, look at each rectangular area. If the area is greater than two squares tall or wide, keep the outer perimeter square of the original color and change everything inside the perimeter square into black. If the area is already two or fewer squares tall or wide, leave it unchanged.\\\\n13. To transform the input grid into the output grid, the colors within each rectangle should be left on the corners and cut from the center. In other words, the central part of each colored rectangle in the input becomes black in the output. Keep the corners and edges of the colored rectangles same as in the input.\\\\n14. To make the output, you have to convert the colored shapes from blocks into empty squares, by retaining the border cells of each block and turning all inner cells of the block to black. The transformation doesn\\\\\\'t apply to any black cell or block of black cells in the input and the rows without any colored blocks remain unaffected.\\\\n15. To make the output, you have to sustain the shape of each coloured square but convert the middle cells of the square to black cells, essentially creating a large \"O\" or \"ring\" shape from each coloured square.\\\\n16. To make the output, you have to partition each colored rectangle in the input grid to form a hollow rectangle, by replacing the inner squares of the rectangles with 0 (black color). The hollow rectangle should retain the original area and color of the input rectangle. Keep the color of the border squares same as in the input grid. All other properties remain unchanged.\\\\n17. To make the output, you have to take each individually colored section and transform it into its own \"ring\" or \"frame\". The outermost edge remains the same color as the input. The area inside this edge gets turned into black, with the exception of a single line of colored boxes directly down the middle. This transformation resembles changing blocks of color into tunnel or tube shapes.\\\\n18. To make the output, you have to adjust the interior of the colorized rectangular shapes, leaving a border of the colored cells around, while the cells inside are turned into black cells. The number of border cells around is 1. This operation does not change the black cells and the colored cells which are already surrounded by black cells.\\\\n19. To make the output, you have to hollow out each square grid so that only the border remains colored. The rest of the squares in the grid with the same color should be turned to black.\\\\n20. To transform the grid, identify the square clusters in the grid. In the output grid, leave the first and last row and column of each cluster unchanged. Turn the cells in the inner part of the cluster (i.e., from second row to second last row and from second column to second last column) into black cells. All remaining cells are left unchanged. In simpler terms, hollow out each brightly colored square, leaving just the border.\\\\n21. To transform the grid, keep the outline of each colored shape the same, but change the interior part of the shape to black. Leave a row of colored blocks in the middle of the shape unchanged.\\\\n22. To make the output, you have to make a rectangular hole in the center of each colored rectangle in the input grid. Preserve the border of each rectangle by leaving the outermost row of each colored rectangle untouched. The remaining middle part should all be converted into black cells.\\\\n23. To make the output, you have to keep the perimeter cells of each color block intact. Then, remove all the remaining block\\\\\\'s cells except for the cells forming a line horizontally and vertically in the middle.\\\\n24. To achieve the output grid, the central part of each colored block has to be removed leaving only a one-cell-thick border of the original block. Notice that this only applies to blocks larger than 2x2. The smaller blocks remain identical in the output. Specifically, for any colored block larger than 2x2, change all interior cells to black while preserving the edge cells in their original color.\\\\n25. To make the output, for each colored block, keep the pattern of that color on the topmost and lowermost row, and then replace the cells in the middle two rows by black cells, so the color blocks become hollow rectangles. Keep the black buffer rows as they are.\\\\n26. Any rectangle within the input grid will have the same exterior as in the input, but the single colored interior is transformed into a hollow version of the rectangle. The colored border will have a thickness of one cell.\\\\n27. To form the output grid, focus on the colored squares in the input grid. Leave the black cells as they are. Shrink the inner color of each colored square in the input grid by removing an inner grid of colored cells, while still keeping the corners filled in. Each square in the output will now be a smaller square of colored cells than in the input, or just a hollow square if the originals were already small.\\\\n28. For each color block, the transformation essentially makes it an outline. All the filled squares in the color blocks are turned to black except the boundary squares. If an outer square of the color block is black, it remains black.\\\\n29. To make the output, you have to first identify the rectangles filled with colored cells (not black) in the input. Then, empty out the middle part of each colored rectangle (leave one cell width border) by turning it into black cells. All other cells remain the same.\\\\n30. To create the output from the input, imagine each colored rectangle to be a hollow of the same size, with the same color. The interior of the rectangle, represented by the 3rd column to the second last column and the 3rd row to the second last row, becomes black. The surrounding rim maintains the colors from the input. The rest of the grid which is black remains the same.\\\\n31. The transformation creates an empty cross (border cells remain the same color but the inside is black) within the former filled squares. The cross is formed by keeping the middle horizontal row and the middle vertical column colored while turning the other cells in the square into black. The location of the squares, their size, and their color do not change during the transformation.\\\\n32. To create the output, make a hole in the center of each colored square in the input by changing the color of the central boxes to black. The hole should be as large as possible without reaching the edge of the square. If the square is shaded by teal, green, fuschia or orange, make a hole of size 3x3. If the square is shaded by red, grey, or yellow, make a hole of size 2x2.\\\\n33. To make the output, you have to frame each of the separated colored block using the same color, making the inside blocks empty or black. The frame thickness is one block. The frame should be a closed square, situated in the similar position as the original block pattern.\\\\n34. To make the output, you should remove the central part of the colored section of the grid while leaving a border. For output generation, the border should have two cells in width in which the color is the same as in the input. Inside the border, the color of cells should be changed to black.\\\\n35. To make the output, you have to carve out the shape of smaller blocks inside the larger colored blocks, leaving only a one-pixel border around it. This is done only in the horizontal direction and does not apply to the blocks at the top, bottom, left and right edges. This transformation makes the uninterrupted blocks of colored pixels into hollow rectangles with a border width of one pixel.\\\\n36. To make the output, you have to transform the solid square shapes in the input into square frames having the same perimeter. Essentially, you should replace all inner cells of square shapes in the input with black (0). Keep all other cells same.\\\\n37. To make the output, you have to \\\\\\'hollow out\\\\\\' the color-filled squares on the grid. This is done by turning the inner squares of the colored region into a black color, thereby creating a hollow, square-shaped border of the original color. The squares remain in their original positions; only their color changes.\\\\n38. To transform the input into the output, remove the central cells within each group of colored cells so that only a border of one cell thick remains. All removed cells become black. If the square of the group of colored cells is smaller than 3x3, leave it as it is. The black cells stay the same.\\\\n39. To make the output, you have to first identify the colored rectangles. Then, for each rectangle, both the top and bottom row of the rectangle should remain as it is, while for the remaining rows, all cells should turn black except the ones at the borders which should retain their original color. Essentially, the transformation hollows out the colored rectangles, leaving only the top, bottom, and side walls.\\\\n40. To get the output, you have to hollow out the colored squares. You do this by turning every interior colored cell (meaning any colored cell not on the edge of its colored square) into a black cell. The edge cells of the colored squares remain the same. The two black rows separating the colored squares also stay the same.\\\\n41. To make the output, you have to replace each rectangle in the input grid with a colored frame that has the same color as the rectangle in the input grid. The width of the frame should be the same as the original rectangle and all the rest of the same colors inside the frame should change to black.\\\\n42. To make the output, you have to take each colored rectangular block and transform it into a smaller rectangular block of the same color in the center of the original block. It resembles creating a \\\\\\'frame\\\\\\' of the colored blocks, where the border of the \\\\\\'frame\\\\\\' is of the same color and the center is left black. Note that the \\\\\\'frame\\\\\\' thickness is equal to 1 cell.\\\\n43. Each rectangle in the input is transformed into a hollow rectangle of the same size (e.g., retaining the color of the outermost layer while making the interior cells black).\\\\n44. To make the output, you have to modify each colored area making them donut-like, i.e., create a same-color frame but leaving an empty (black) space on the inside. If a rectangle is 4 boxes wide or tall, the center is left empty. The height and width of the black area in the middle should be the original area\\\\\\'s height and width minus 2. Maintain the black spaces the same.\\\\n45. To transform the input grid to the output, replace each cell in the colored rectangle, except for the border cells, into black cells. This will make the colored rectangle a hollow shape.\\\\n46. The transformation involves hollowing out the middle of each colored block line. For each colored line, leave the topmost and lowest line and the blocks at each end intact. Replace the inner blocks with black blocks.\\\\n47. To make the output, you have to transform each colored block of cells in the input to a hollow rectangular frame of the same color and size where only the border cells are colored, and the cells interior to the block are black. This transformation does not affect the black cells or the arrangement of colors in the input.\\\\n48. For each distinct color in the grid, if it forms a rectangular block, replace the interior cells of the rectangle with black, while leaving the bordering cells colored as they were originally in the input, creating a hollowed rectangle of the same color. The black cells and any other cells that are not part of these rectangular blocks remain unchanged.\\\\n49. To make the output, you have to draw a black line forming a smaller square inside the colored squares, while the outer square remains colored and the inner square is black. Ensure that the black line dividing the colored square is just one block width and that the colored square has a minimum of three block width to allow for a smaller square inside it.\\\\n50. To make the output, you have to hollow out the colored stripes. Leave the first and last row of each color stripe as it is and replace the middle rows of each stripe with the same color only on both sides, rest all cells should be made black. This will create a sort of \\\\\\'border\\\\\\' effect for each colored stripe.\\\\n51. To make the output, you need to locate the geometric shapes in the input grid. In each shape, you need to create a smaller version of the shape at the center leaving the boundary of the original shape intact. The smaller version of the shape should consist of black cells. Thus, you\\\\\\'re creating a hollow or doughnut shape out of the original solid shapes.\\\\n52. To make the output, turn each non-black rectangle from the input grid into a hollow rectangular frame of the same color by changing the interior cells to black while leaving the border cells with the original color. The thickness of the border in the frame should be 1 cell. Other non-colored cells should stay the same.\\\\n53. The transformation converts each solid colored rectangle into a rectangle frame (hollow rectangle) of the same color and size. This transformation removes the color from the inner cells of each rectangle, leaving only the outermost cells of each rectangle colored.\\\\n54. To make the output, you have to leave the first and last row and column of each square unchanged. Replace the colors in the middle with empty black spaces, essentially making each square into a hollow square of the same size and color.\\\\n55. To make the output, you have to apply the transformation on each differently colored square. The transformation is: If the color square is 4x4 or larger, transform it into a hollow square of the same color by making the inner 2x2 square black. If the square is smaller than 4x4, leave it as it is.\\\\n56. To make the output, in every colored rectangle, you need to transform the inner cells into black cells, while keeping the border cells intact. The border of a rectangle consists of the cells that have at least one neighboring cell in a different color or black. The interior of a rectangle is formed by cells that have all neighboring cells of the same color.\\\\n57. To make the output, you have to hollow out the inside of each colored square, leaving only the outer perimeter of each square. This results in the formation of colored square frames with black squares inside.\\\\n58. To make the output, you have to change the inner pixels (except the border pixels) of each rectangle with the black color (number 0). The result is a hollow rectangle of the same shape and color for each solid rectangle in the input.\\\\n59. To make the output, you have to hollow out the colored rectangles by replacing in its center with black cells. However, the outermost cells of the rectangle, top, bottom, left, and right boundaries remain the same. These changes should retain the rectangle shape, essentially hollowing out the centers.\\\\n60. To make the output, you have to change the inner part of each color block into black, except the border line of the block keeps its original color. The border line of the color block means the color squares which have at least one side or corner adjacent with outside black square. For the inner part of the blocks, convert them to black squares. Other black squares and the order of colored blocks keep as the original.\\\\n61. To make the output, you have to trace a diagonal line starting from the upper left corner to the lower right corner and another diagonal line from the upper right to the lower left in each colored square. Then, keep the color of the cells falling on those lines and make all the other cells inside the square black.\\\\n62. To make the output, you have to keep the perimeter of the block as is and all the inside squares of the blocks should be transformed to black cells. Essentially, it hollows out the different colored blocks, leaving only their border.\\\\n63. To make the output, you have to transform the color blocks in the input to have hollow centers. In other words, any interior cells of the colored rectangles which are completely surrounded by the same color are turned black. The edge cells remain the same to retain the rectangular shape with only outline cells of the shape\\\\\\'s original color. Only the outermost boundary of the same colored block is kept, the inside cells are all changed to black.\\\\n64. To make the output, you have to find the center of the rectangles in the input and replace it with black squares.  For a rectangular shape with a length of 4 boxes or more, you need to change all the boxes into black except for the edge boxes. The exact boxes to change to black in the middle of the rectangle depends on the size of the rectangle. For an odd number sized rectangle, remove only the very center box, but for an even-numbered rectangle, remove four boxes in the center.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "After analyzing the rules, they can be categorized into eight distinct categories based on their similarities.

For each category, synthesize the rules into a single, specific rule that combines the ideas of all rules in that category, while clearly differentiating it from the other categories.\\\\nThe new rule should be as specific as possible, following the format of the given rules.\\\\nThe new rule should be applicable without any information from the original rules - i.e. it should be standalone.\\\\n\\\\nRules:\\\\n1. To make the output, you have to change the pixels around the colored pixel in the blue squares to match the color of the colored pixel in each square.The square\\\\\\'s edge remains blue. If there are multiple squares, each square changes independently based on the colored pixel in its center.\\\\n2. To make the output, you have to replace a colored grid with the shape of the grid that is the main color which is found in the middle of each colored grid. For example, if a blue grid with a red square in the center is in the input, the output should show a red grid with the same shape as the blue grid in the input. Each colored grid transforms individually ignoring other colored grids in the input.\\\\n3. To make the output, you need to find all rectangles created by colored pixels. Then, modify all the pixels within the rectangle that do not match the color of the horizontal sides of the rectangle with the color of the vertical sides of the rectangle. The black pixels in the rectangle become the same color as the vertical sides.\\\\n4. To achieve the output grid, you have to fill the inside of each 5x5 square (excluding bordering blue cells) with the color that is not black or blue from the same square in the input grid. If the square only contains black and blue, retain the original blue and black pattern.\\\\n5. To make the output, you have to identify the different colored squares (not including blue or black) within the blue shapes. Fill in the entire shape with the color of the identified square. Leave the black squares and blue squares outside of the shape untouched.\\\\n6. To make the output, you have to transform the content of each field of squares. If there is a non-black square, exchange the color of this square with blue squares. The closed rectangular shapes of squares become outlined with exchanged squares. The pattern of shapes and lines remains mirrored. The black line remains black.\\\\n7. To make the output, you have to scan the input grid for rectangular-shaped blue patterns. Replace all the blue squares surrounding the different colored square (in the same pattern) with that color. If another pattern present lower in the grid, repeat the same operation with it.\\\\n8. To transform the input into the output, replace all blue squares inside the colored square\\\\\\'s row and column in the rectangle with the color of the square found in the center of the rectangle. The isolated blue squares, as well as the blue squares not located in the same row and column as the colored square, do not change and remain blue. The black cells and the colored square also remain unchanged in the output grid.\\\\n9. The blue numerical \\\\\\'0\\\\\\' shape is kept the same in the output, and if there\\\\\\'s a color in the middle of it (besides blue or black), it fills the inside of the \\\\\\'0\\\\\\' shape in the output grid. However, some parts that were filled with the color that has now filled most of the \\\\\\'0\\\\\\' are left black (those cells that were originally black around the number that appeared inside the \\\\\\'0\\\\\\' on the input grid). The rest of the input is copied identically to the output.\\\\n10. To transform from input to output, look at the center-most square in each different colored square region. Replace the color of the surrounding squares in the same region with the color from the square in the center. Leave any squares outside these regions as they are.\\\\n11. To make the output, you have to identify the odd-colored rectangles and fill out the same row with its color, but preserving the blue rectangles.\\\\n12. To make the output, identify the non-black and non-blue color inside each rectangle. Then, this color is used to fill the adjacent inside areas of the rectangle that are originally blue. The other aspects of the input grid remains unchanged in the output.\\\\n13. For transforming the grid, you should fill up the inner vicinity of the blue shape other than the central pixel and replace it with the highest digit found in the shape but only if the number is greater than 1. In other words, replace the 0s in the shape with the highest digit in the shape if that number is greater than 1.\\\\n14. The first step is to find the non-blue, non-black colored pixel and color the entire blue section that corresponds to that box with the color of the pixel. Repeat this for all different colors in the blue boxes. Keep all the other areas (background and the blue box itself) untouched.\\\\n15. To make the output, you have to fill the third colored cell (not black or blue) in the blue shape/pattern in a way that it spreads to the blue blocks leaving alone the first and last vertical columns. The fill color varies depending on the third colored cell (red, grey, or teal) in the sequence.\\\\n16. To transform the grid, the cells that make up the shape of the letter \\\\\\'H\\\\\\' in the squares are painted the same color as the row or column of cells that separate the two squares. The rest of the cells in the squares should remain blue. The black cells surrounding the squares remain black.\\\\n17. To make the output, you have to replace all the black cells that directly surround the second color within blue squares with the second color. Other parts of the grid remain unchanged.\\\\n18. To make the output, you have to fill every cell inside the hollow blue square, including the boundary, with the color of the cell that is located at the center of the square in the input grid. If there is no center color, keep the cells inside the square, including the boundary, blue. The cells outside the square and inside other shapes remain unchanged. The black background in the input grid is also maintained in the output grid.\\\\n19. To make the output, you have to replace number 0 cells in the blue region that are 2 cells away in any direction from the non-blue cell with the color of that non-blue cell. Do not change any other cells or regions with no non-blue cell.\\\\n20. To make the output, you have to look into the colored square in the input grid. If in the colored square, there\\\\\\'s another color other than blue, replace all the black cells inside the blue square with the new color. However, if the entire blue square does not contain any new color inside, replace all black cells inside the blue square with a black color (or empty). The rest of the grid remains the same.\\\\n21. The transformation needed from the input to the output entails recognizing the frame or squares made from blue (1) and replacing the black (0) color inside the frame/squares with the color of the other colored pixel in the frame/square. If there is no frame/square, the input will be the same as the output.\\\\n22. Every characteristic of the input 10x10 grid remains persistent or identical in the output grid. The primary difference is that cells within the blue structures that do not follow the central square color will change to the color of the central square. The square in the middle of each structure seems to have an effect in filling the rest of the figure with its designated color in the output, but it maintains the blue colored cells that form the outside of the figure. The grid position of the transformed cells stays identical in input and output. Only the colors change. The transformation seems to work individually within each blue structure.   In a simplified term, you could describe the pattern as - \"fill foreground cells in the color of the central figure but preserve the outline\".\\\\n23. The transformation involves replacing the blue grid around a colored number (inside the rectangle) with that colored number. For instance, in the first case, the blue rectangle surrounding the red number 2 is replaced with red-colored cells having number 2. Similarly, in the third case, the rectangle surrounding the green number 6 is replaced with green ones.\\\\n24. To make the output, you have to identify the colored cell in the middle of the blue lines in the input and change all black cells around it within the vertical column bounding the blue line to the same color as the colored cell. The height of the new colored area should be the same height as the blue line. Retain the colors of the blue cells and any other colors in the vertical lines that aren\\\\\\'t black.\\\\n25. Essentially, the transformation pattern here seems to be a color filling or diffusion process. The intermediate color (not blue and black) in each block \\\\\\'spreads\\\\\\' or \\\\\\'diffuses\\\\\\' into the neighboring blue squares. This creates a broader fence of the intermediate color on the outside of the square. Everything else in the grid remains the same, especially the black squares denoting separation.\\\\n26. To make the output, you have to replace the black cells in between the blue region with the value of the number in between the blue region. If there are multiple color regions, handle each region individually in the same way.\\\\n27. To create the output, you have to replace all the black squares of the upper shape (including its bordering black squares) with the color used in the inner square of that shape. Do the same for the lower shape. Keep the black squares outside the shapes and the squares on the yellow line the same. If a shape doesn\\\\\\'t contain a colored square in its interior, leave it blue as it is.\\\\n28. For transformation, identify the colored pattern other than color 1 inside of the patterns formed by 1\\\\\\'s. Replace these blocks of color with the color found inside the formed pattern, while retaining the pattern shape. The resulting inside shape will adopt the color found within it in the original input, and the outside shape will retain original color 1. Features outside of these patterns remain unchanged. This appears to simulate a color being \\\\\\'spilled\\\\\\' or filled into the pattern outlines.\\\\n29. In the transformation, you swap the color of the outer area of the upper and the lower squares while preserving the borders and inner areas. Specifically, the outer area of the upper square, which is originally blue (1), is changed into the color of the inner square within the lower square if there is one (For example, in Case 2, it is changed into fuschia (6) because the inner square within the lower square was fuschia.) If there is no lower square (like in Case 0), it is changed into red (2).   This rule applies vice versa for the lower square, swapping its outer area\\\\\\'s color with the color of the inner square within the upper square. If there\\\\\\'s no inner square within the upper square (like there is no inner square within the blue square in Case 0), it is changed into red (2).  Every other cell keeps its original color.\\\\n30. To make the output, you first have to identify whether there is a blue shape in the upper or lower part of the grid. Then identify if any different colored spot is present in the middle of these blue shapes.  For the blue shape in the upper part, you have to replace all the cells that are horizontally or vertically adjacent to black cells (or the cell on the perimeter of the shape) and not diagonally with the color of the spot if there is any. If there isn\u2019t any different colored spot in the middle of the blue shape, replace the cells with black.  For the blue shape in the lower part, you do the same except the cells that are diagonally adjacent to black cells and not horizontally or vertically. They are replaced with the color of the spot or black if there isn\\\\\\'t any different colored spot.  The color of spots in the blue shapes doesn\\\\\\'t change. All the remaining cells should remain the same.\\\\n31. To make the output, you need to follow a specific pattern. If a red line is intersected by a blue line on row x, replace the intervening cells on that row with the color indicated by the central cell of the intersecting blue line. For example, if the central cell is 2, replace the cells with red color; 6 with light purple, or 3 with green. After intersection, if there\\\\\\'s another blue figure under or above, repeat the process with the number indicated at the center of that figure. Repeat the process for the entire grid.\\\\n32. To make the output, you have to transform the blue lines that enclose the colored cells, into the the color of the enclosed cell. This can be interpreted as spreading the color of the singular cell onto the lines of the rectangle. The rest of the elements in the grid must remain the same.\\\\n33. To make the output, replace the black squares inside the blue figure with squares of the inner color present in the figure. If the color inside the figure is red, replace the black squares with red. If it\\\\\\'s yellow, replace them with yellow. If it\\\\\\'s teal, replace them with teal. Do not disturb the blue squares or any other squares outside the blue figure. If multiple blue figures are present in the input, apply the rule to each figure separately.\\\\n34. To make the output, you have to: - Look for blocks of colored numbers (not zeros) - Each of these blocks of numbers correspond to an inner square in blue and an inner number - Then replace the blue color (number 1) with the color of the numbered cell found in that block in the outer boundary (excluding corners). - This forms a sort of \\\\\\'highlighting\\\\\\' effect and occurs independently for each block.\\\\n35. To make the output, locate the group of blue squares forming a shape and the non-blue square in the center of this shape. Replace all of the black squares that are within or on the boundary of this shape with the color of the center square. The remaining part of the grid is kept intact. This rule is applied independently to each form in the grid.\\\\n36. To transform the grid, you should color all the pixels inside (surrounded by) the blue figures with the color of the distinctive pixel found inside the blue figure. For example, if there is a red pixel inside a blue figure, all the pixels inside the blue figure should be colored red. The area outside the blue figures and the pixels of the figures themselves should not be painted.\\\\n37. To make the output, you have to find the colored pixel (which color is not blue) in those segments and replace the nearby blue pixels to this color. For example, if the colored pixel is red, then all the blue pixels on its left and right in the segment will be turned to red. Please note, blue color represents the number 1, and black color represents 0.\\\\n38. To get the output from the input, do the following: Keep the shapes with blue cells (rectangles or squares) and the single cell located at their center as they are. The magic happens on the cells surrounding the central one: if they used to be black cells, color them with the color of the central cell.\\\\n39. To make the output, you should consider only the colored rectangle. If there is a colored block other than blue within this rectangle, all the black blocks inside this rectangle should be changed to the same color with this block in the output. Other blocks (blue ones and the differently colored one) within the rectangle are unchanged in the output. The rest of blocks outside of these rectangles are also unchanged.\\\\n40. To make the output, you have to locate the colored shapes in the same location as the input but replace the black pixels that form the border with the color of the middle pixel of each pattern. If there\\\\\\'s no differently colored pixel in the middle, make the border black.\\\\n41. To make the output, first identify the colored number in the center of the blue square. Then replace all the bordering black boxes within the blue square  with new squares in the color of that number. The pattern of the boxes inside the blue square remains the same as the input grid. If there are more than one blue squares in the input grid, perform the same operation for each of them.\\\\n42. To make the output, replace all the black boxes inside the blue shape with the color contained by the blue shape (red, teal or purple). You can do this by following these steps: 1. Identify the blue shape\\\\\\'s center, which will be defined as the colored box (if it exists, else center remains black). 2. Replace all boxes inside the blue shape with the color of the center box, with the exception of the blue boxes on the boundary of the shape. 3. Leave everything else in the grid unchanged.\\\\n43. The output is generated by taking the geometric shapes and transforming the surrounding blue squares to match the color of the square(s) that are in the center of the shape. Note that the transformation only applies to the blue squares that are directly surrounding the colored squares within the shape. The rest of the blue squares and the black background remain unchanged.\\\\n44. To make the output, you have to take the spot where the color of the second rectangle resides in the first rectangle and fill the second rectangle\\\\\\'s shape in the first rectangle completely. Inversely, you also take the spot where the color of the first rectangle resides in the second rectangle and fill the first rectangle\\\\\\'s shape in the second rectangle completely. The rest other areas are mirrored on both rectangles.\\\\n45. The transformation involves changing the blue color to other colors based on the colored number originally found inside the blue shape. If there was a red \\\\\\'2\\\\\\' in the blue shape, change all blue \\\\\\'1\\\\\\'s to red \\\\\\'2\\\\\\'s. The same goes for the other numbers and colors; if it was a fuschia \\\\\\'6\\\\\\', change all blue \\\\\\'1\\\\\\'s to fuschia \\\\\\'6\\\\\\'s. If a blue shape had no colored number inside it, then it remains blue in the output. Another rule is that if there are multiple blue shapes, then the transformations apply separately for each one - that is, numbers inside one shape do not affect another shape. In this scenario, each transformed shape will have their own unique color. For the remaining cells outside of the shapes, they remain black as in the input grid.\\\\n46. To make the output, if there is a red, fuschia or any other number inside the blue squares, change all black numbers in that blue square to the number present. Other parts of the grid remain the same.\\\\n47. To make the output, you have to change the pattern in the grid. Starting from the second line of the pattern, color the lines till one line before the end of a pattern in the color of the colored pixel found inside the pattern. The colored pixel would occur only in the pattern\\\\\\'s third line from top. If no colored pixel is inside the pattern, leave it unchanged.\\\\n48. To create the output, we first need to identify the coloured cell in the center of the blue square. We then have to highlight every cell that has a straight path to the coloured cell and is also surrounded by Blue cells. These cells then turn to the color of the center cell. The rule is also issued for the figure at the bottom.\\\\n49. To make the output, replace all the black \\\\\\'0\\\\\\'s inside the boxes with the color number present inside the same box while maintaining the blue \\\\\\'1\\\\\\'s as a box boundary. All the remaining grid spaces outside the blue \\\\\\'1\\\\\\' boxes remain as black \\\\\\'0\\\\\\'s.\\\\n50. To generate the output grid, you must take the color of the internal square in the blue square in the input and extend that color to fill the previously empty squares inside the blue square. Leave the grid black if there are no squares.\\\\n51. For the transformation, colour all the cells that are orthogonally connected to the cell in the center of the figure with the color of the center cell retaining its shape. Keep the rest of the grid identical to the input grid.\\\\n52. To make the output, you have to transform the upper and lower shapes (made of blue cells) into a new single color structure.  For the upper shape, fill all empty cells within the shape with red cells (if they exist), turning it into a red structure. For the lower shape, fill all empty cells within the shape with the color of the single colored cell inside (if it exists), turning it into a structure of that color. If multiple single colored cells with different colors exist in the lower shape, use the color of the cell that appears first when reading the grid from left to right, and from top to bottom. For all the other cells that are not part of the two shapes, keep their color as in the input grid.\\\\n53. To make the output, you have to fill the cells outside and within the rectangles. Cells surrounding the blue rectangle are colored with the color that filled in the middle row of that rectangle. The cells within the blue rectangle remain unchanged. If the cell is inside any small color square, but outside of the blue rectangle, it also takes the color of that small square. Other cells remain black.\\\\n54. The rule of transformation seems centered on the blue patterns found in each region (upper and lower parts). Each blue pixel that is adjacent to a black pixel (only looking horizontally and vertically, not diagonally) is replaced with the color (i.e., the number) of the central pixel square within the blue pattern. The transformation only applies to the region where the colored square is found. The remaining blue squares or any differently colored squares remain unaffected.   Note: This pattern assumes that the colored square will always be surrounded by blue squares in the shape pattern, and the distinct color pixel is not on the periphery of the overall 10x10 grid.\\\\n55. To make the output, you need to keep the blue squares intact but fill the empty spaces inside the rectangle with the color of the box that was originally inside the rectangle. If there are two rectangles, you fill the empty space inside each rectangle with the color of the box that was inside that specific rectangle. The squares that are not part of the rectangle(s) remain black.\\\\n56. If the blue configuration forms a shape, the cells that form the border of that shape are replaced with the highest non-blue number found within that shape in the output grid. If there are no non-blue numbers within the shape, the border remains blue. The transformation is applied independently on each separate blue configuration. Other cells within the configuration and all the other cells outside the configuration remain unchanged.\\\\n57. To make the output, you have to identify the highest numerical value within each outlined shape and flood-fill the areas that were previously black with this identified color within each shape. Keep the outline color (blue) unchanged.\\\\n58. To make the output, you have to do the following transformations:   - For each figure encased by blue squares, replace all the black cells inside the blue squares with cells of the same color as the non-blue colored cell if present in the figure.  - Leave colors of the cells outside the blue squares unchanged. - Repeat this process for every other colored figure present in the grid.   For example, if a cell within the blue-figure contains a red cell, convert the other black cells inside the blue squares to red. The blue squares, yellow line or any cells outside the figures remain unchanged.\\\\n59. The transformation requires expanding the non-1 color within the rectangle of 1s to the full size of the rectangle, except for the cells that contain 1s on edges. If a cell inside the 1s rectangle was black (0), it gets colored with the non-1 color. If it was 1, it remains 1. All other 0s outside of the 1s rectangles remain 0s in the output grid.\\\\n60. To make the output, you have to fill the entire enclosed area that surrounds a single cell with a number other than 1, using that number. Here, an \\\\\\'enclosed area\\\\\\' refers to a continuous space that completely surrounds a certain point and its boundaries are made up of number 1 or the grid sides.\\\\n61. To make the output, you have to change the black cells in each blue rectangle that surround a colored cell by the color of that central cell. The rest remains unaltered.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "Category 1: Rules that involve changing the color of pixels based on the color of a central pixel.\n- Rule 1\n- Rule 2\n- Rule 4\n- Rule 5\n- Rule 7\n- Rule 8\n- Rule 10\n- Rule 18\n- Rule 20\n- Rule 21\n- Rule 22\n- Rule 24\n- Rule 25\n- Rule 27\n- Rule 28\n- Rule 30\n- Rule 32\n- Rule 33\n- Rule 35\n- Rule 36\n- Rule 38\n- Rule 41\n- Rule 42\n- Rule 43\n- Rule 45\n- Rule 48\n- Rule 51\n- Rule 54\n- Rule 55\n- Rule 56\n- Rule 57\n- Rule 58\n- Rule 59\n- Rule 60\n- Rule 61\n\nSynthesized Rule: To make the output, identify the central colored pixel within each distinct shape or pattern.

To make the output, the contains 4 squares of the dominant color (not black) of the last colored 5x5 square in clockwise order.\\\\n2. To make the output, you have to identify the color of boxes in the digit that appears first (upper or top left in the case of tie) in the reading order (left to right, top to bottom). Fill the output square with this color . All boxes in the output are filled with this single color.\\\\n3. To make the output, transform the input by taking the 5x5 grid that is in the bottom right-hand corner (whether it\\\\\\'s composed of black or colored cells) and replace the entire grid with four cells of the color that appears on the top left-hand side of the input grid. If no such colored cells are present, replace the grid with black cells.\\\\n4. To make the output, you have to replace the first shape in the input with a 2x2 grid all of the same color as the first shape, while ignoring the second shape.\\\\n5. To make the output, you have to fill the 2x2 output grid with the color being used in the upper right square of the input grid.\\\\n6. To make the output, you need to calculate the most frequent non-black color for each apparition of  the 5x5 square separated by the empty black band and to fill the output grid with this color. In the case that there is no non-black color appearing more than once, you may select any of the non-black colors.\\\\n7. The output is generated by identifying the color of the squares in the input and creating a solid 2x2 square of that color in the output. The color of the upper square of the input is used to fill the upper part of the output, and the color of the lower square of the input is used to fill the lower part of the output.\\\\n8. The transformation compresses each colored square into a 2x2 square of the same color in the output grid. The top half of the input corresponds to the top half of the output, and the bottom half of the input corresponds to the bottom half of the output. The color of each 2x2 square in the output is the same as the color of the corresponding square in the input.\\\\n9. To change the input into the output, you should identify the color of the lower square in the input grid (ignoring the black color), and then fill all the squares in the output grid with this color.\\\\n10. To make the output, from each of the four squares in the input grid, identify the colored square (if there is one) and map it to one of the four squares in the output grid in the same relative position. If a square in the input grid does not contain a colored square, map it to a black square in the output grid.\\\\n11. To make the output, you have to identify the color of the rectangular box from the most recent row where both rectangles were colored in the input. Then, color all the boxes in the output with the identified color.\\\\n12. To make the output, you have to \\\\\\'shrink\\\\\\' the large colored squares on the diagonal of the input (from top left to bottom right) to 2x2 squares with the same colors. The colors from the two large squares should replace the two black squares in the top left and bottom right of the 2x2 output. The color from the top left square in the input should be placed in the top left of the output, and the bottom right color in the input should be placed in the bottom right of the output. The other two cells in the output should match this corresponding color.\\\\n13. To make the output, you need to pick the color of the enclosed square from each 7x7 square in the input. From the top square, choose the color for the top left and top right squares of the output. From the bottom square, choose the color for the bottom left and bottom right squares of the output. Ignore all black cells.\\\\n14. To make the output, you have to condense each square from the input into a single cell in the output, maintaining their position relative to each other. The color of each condensed cell should be the color of the original squares. If the square in the input is in the upper left quadrant, it will correspond to the upper left cell in the output,  and so on for each square and quadrant.\\\\n15. The rule for the transformation is to replace each 10x10 input grid with a 2x2 output grid. The number in the output grid is the same as the one in the 4x4 square in the lower part of the input grid. This mean all elements in the output grid will have the same number.\\\\n16. To make the output, select the color of the square from the bottom half of the input grid. Fill the four cells in the output grid with the selected color.\\\\n17. To make the output, you have to evaluate the input grid and determine which color, teal or orange, is present more on the flat grid. The output grid will then be composed entirely of the color that was in majority in the input grid.\\\\n18. To make the output, you have to scale down each square into a single cell. Hence, the big square on top is shrunk to a single cell on the top of the output, and the lower big square is shrunk to the bottom cell in the output. The output consists of two rows, the color of the top row is the same as the color of the square at the top in the input, and the color of bottom row is the same as the color of square at the bottom in the input.\\\\n19. To make the output, you have to fill the 2x2 grid with the color of the square that appears at the top in the input grid.\\\\n20. To transform each input to its corresponding output, create a 2x2 grid. Then fill it with the color of the first box that appears in the input grid. The color is decided by looking at the the first non-empty color from left to right, from top to bottom.\\\\n21. To make the output, you have to take the color of the squares that you see in the input and fill the 2x2 grid completely with this color. That means the output will be a 2x2 square of the same color.\\\\n22. The transformation involves extracting the color of topmost shape in the input grid and filling it into the entire 2x2 output grid. The colors, positions or shapes in the rest part of the input grid are irrelevant to the transformation.\\\\n23. To make the output, you have to omit the small square at the corner and shrink the colored pattern of the bigger square into a 2x2 grid with the same color.\\\\n24. To make the output, you have to replace each 5x5 square in the input with one square in the output of the same color as the squares in the 5x5 square. The position of the colored square in the output should correspond to the position of the 5x5 square in the input.\\\\n25. To make the output, you need to select the color used to draw each square in the input, then fill up the squares in the output with the color corresponding to the square in the input, from top square to bottom square in the input to the leftmost to rightmost square in the output.\\\\n26. To make the output, you have to find the color (which is not black) in the input, assign it to all the cells in the output grid. So, the output grid contains only one color, this color is the same as the color found in the input.\\\\n27. To make the output, consider the color of the bottom-most colored square in the input. Fill all the cells in the output grid with this color code.\\\\n28. To make the output, you have to check the color of the non-black square shapes. Take the topmost square and color the top left cell in the output the same color. In the same way, color the top right cell in the output the same color as the square in rightmost region in the input. For the bottom cells, the bottom left cell in the output should have the same color as the bottommost square in the input, and the bottom right should carry the color of the leftmost square in the input. If those positions are black in the input, the corresponding cell in the output should also be black.\\\\n29. To make the output, you have to note the color of numbers in the larger 5x5 square of the input. These colors are then applied to the 2x2 output grid. The output grid should be fully painted with the color of the larger 5x5 square in the input.  In other words, if the larger 5x5 square is painted with \"7\", then the 2x2 output grid would also be painted fully with \"7\". If the larger 5x5 square is painted with \"4\", then the 2x2 output grid would also be painted fully with \"4\", and so on.\\\\n30. To make the output, create a 2x2 grid where each square is filled with the color of the filled square in the input grid. If the filled square shapes is in the left upper corner then fill the left upper corner of the 2x2 grid with its color, and if it\\\\\\'s in the right lower corner then fill the right lower corner of the 2x2 grid with its color. In case the cell of the 2x2 grid doesn\\\\\\'t contain any color from the input, fill it with black.\\\\n31. To make the output, you have to look at the lower hollow square from the input. If the lower square is colored in its border fringe, fill in the entire output with that color. If the lower square is not colored, fill in the entire output with the color used in the upper square border fringe.\\\\n32. To make the output, you have to create a 2x2 square that mimics the color of the larger square in the upper half of the input grid. All the cells in the output grid should be of this color.\\\\n33. To make the output, you have to look at the color of the first square (top one if squares are positioned vertically, or left one if they are arranged horizontally) and fill the whole 2x2 grid with that color.\\\\n34. To generate the output, the color code associated with the second square (from the top) in the input grid is taken and a 2x2 square is created using that color code only.\\\\n35. The color of the 2x2 square in the output grid should be the same as the color of the lines in the 5x5 squares in the input grid. If the central line or the corners of the first square is in color X and the central line or the corners of the second square are in color Y, then the 2x2 square in the output grid should be in color X.\\\\n36. The output grid indicates the smaller square representation of the larger square in the upper left corner  of the input grid. The color of all cells in the output grid is the same as the color of the larger square in the input grid.\\\\n37. To make the output grid, you have to check the color of the rectangle in the input grid and fill the output grid fully with that color.\\\\n38. To make the output, you have to identify the color of the outlined square with the colored center, and fill all squares in the output grid with this color.\\\\n39. To make the output, you have to identify the color of the larger squares found at the corners of the grid. For instance, if the large square at the top left is orange, all boxes in the top left chunk of the output should be orange. Then if the large square at the bottom right is teal, all boxes in the bottom right chunk of the output should be teal. Note: all divisions of the output are equal and make up a 2x2 grid.\\\\n40. To make the output, you have to find the bigger shape in the input grid and construct a 2x2 colored grid using its color. The size of each pattern in the input is calculated by subtracting the number of black cells inside the rectangular shape from the total number of cells it possesses. Then pick the color of the pattern which has more colored cells to fill in the 2x2 output grid with.\\\\n41. To obtain the output, consider only the lower rectangle of the input grid. The color of this rectangle will fully occupy the output grid. You essentially replace the output grid with the color of the bottom rectangle from the input grid.\\\\n42. The transformation pattern seems to involve taking the shape that is smallest, ignoring color, and compressing it down into a 2x2 square of the same color as the original shape.\\\\n43. The transformation involves recognizing the shape and color of the filled squares in the input. The output grid is filled with 2X2 squares of the color seen in the upper square of the input. The lower part doesn\\\\\\'t affect the output.\\\\n44. To do that first steps are to identify the color of bottom square box and then fill 2x2 output grid with that color.\\\\n45. To create the output, you should return a 2x2 grid filled with the color of the second box in the input. The second box is defined as the one being placed lower in the grid or to the right if they are aligned horizontally.\\\\n46. To make the output, you count the number of non-black cells that form the frame in the input grid, then fill the 2x2 output grid with the corresponding color number. The position or other shapes of the non-black elements in the input is not relevant for the output.\\\\n47. To create the output, you should locate the color of the bottom square on the input and fill the whole 2x2 output grid with that color identifier.\\\\n48. To make the output, you need to replace the bigger square, whichever color it is, with a 2x2 square of the same color.\\\\n49. Follow these steps:         1. Identify the larger colored square in the original grid. Even if that colored square is in two parts, treat them as one unified square.         2. Replace it with a 2x2 square of the same color in the output grid. To make the output, you have to shrink the bigger box to a 2x2 box with same color. It\\\\\\'s like the two big boxes are competing and the larger one wins and gets to color the output.\\\\n50. To make the output, you have to identify the color of the square in the last non-empty section of the grid. Then the output 2x2 square becomes the discovered color.\\\\n51. To make the output, you have to identify the lower shape of the two shapes in the input grid. The output then is a 2x2 grid in the color of this lower shape.\\\\n52. To achieve the output, check the top left corner of both \"hollow boxes\" in the input grid. The output grid is filled with the number that is in the top left corner of the bottom right box from the input grid.\\\\n53. To make the output, you have to find which color forms a square in the input grid. The 2x2 output grid then becomes this color.\\\\n54. To get the output, select the color number that is the highest between the two shapes of the input grid and fill the output grid fully with that number. In case the colors are the same for the shapes, use that color.\\\\n55. To make the output, you have to look for the object, the colored square, that doesn\\\\\\'t have any other colored cells inside it (is completely full). Then replace every cell in the output grid with the color of that full colored square.\\\\n56. To make the output, you have to take the color of the second square (positioned in the lower half of the input grid). Once identified, fill all boxes in the 2x2 output grid with that color.\\\\n57. To transform the grid, check the color of the digit in the second box from the right. Then, fill the 2x2 grid entirely with that color.\\\\n58. To make the output, you have to first consider the lower shape in the input grid. If the left and right sides and top and bottom sides of this shape are unbroken (all cells are non-zero), then all cells in the output grid will take the value of those non-zero cells.\\\\n59. To make the output, you have to determine the color of the rectangle in each half. Fill the top half of the output with the color of the top rectangle and the bottom half of the output with the color of the bottom rectangle. If there is no rectangle in the half, fill the corresponding half of the output with black.\\\\n60. Look at the non-black square at the bottom of the input grid. The color of this square should be the color of the entire output grid.\\\\n61. To make the output, you have to check the color of the rectangle that is closer to the left side of the input grid. The entire 2x2 output grid should be filled with that color.\\\\n62. To make the output, you have to ignore the black cells, and transform each of the 2 original colored squares into a 1x1 square of the same color in the output. The top square in the input corresponds to the top cell in the output, and the bottom square in the input corresponds to the bottom cell in the output. Regardless of the original size and shape of the colored squares, they become a 1x1 square in the output.\\\\n63. To transform the input into the output, you need to find the color of the rectangle that the other rectangle is located within, and fill the 2x2 output grid with that color.\\\\n64. The first step is to choose the filled boxes. If R surrounds a box, then in the output grid, the color of the corresponding box will likewise be R. If G wraps the box in the input grid, then in the output grid, the corresponding box color will also be G, and so on. Then replace emptiness with the color of the box in the output grid.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "Category 1: Rules based on the dominant or most frequent color\n1.

For each category, synthesize the rules into a single, specific rule that combines the ideas of all rules in that category, while clearly differentiating it from the other categories.\\\\nThe new rule should be as specific as possible, following the format of the given rules.\\\\nThe new rule should be applicable without any information from the original rules - i.e. it should be standalone.\\\\n\\\\nRules:\\\\n1. The topmost blue shape in the input grid (magically) drops down straight line until it hits a red shape or the bottom of the grid, filling all the black cells it passes with blue. If it hits a red shape, it stops at the row above it; if it doesn\\\\\\'t hit any red shapes, it fills all the way to the very bottom of the grid. The red shapes remain at their initial positions.\\\\n2. To make the output, you have to replace the whole area spanned by one color with the other color, while keeping the original pattern. For example, if the blue color is on top and red color is at the bottom, the colors should be swapped.\\\\n3. To make the output, you have to repeat the top rectangle on the rows right above the bottom rectangle. The length of the rectangle is determined by the width of the top rectangle. This rectangle keeps its original color - blue. The bottom rectangle keeps its original color - red. When it repeats, the rectangle doesn\\\\\\'t overwrite the color of the bottom rectangle, so only the black pixels will be replaced.\\\\n4. To form the output, find the outline box of the non-black squares (assuming black to be background). Then, the blue cross is copied over all the rows that have red squares in the same column. The red squares are maintained and not changed.\\\\n5. To make the output, you have to look for the red band on the input grid and duplicate it above in the direction of the blue band if any. The blue band gets overwritten here by the red band.\\\\n6. To make the output, you have to overlay the shapes from the top section to the bottom section while retaining the figures in their original place in the bottom section. In places where both shapes coincide, the figure of the topmost shape is retained. Transpose the shapes present in the top-most line but not in the bottom-most line, down to the black spaces in the bottom-most line. The single figure shapes at the top remain unaltered.\\\\n7. To make the output, you have to take the shape formed by blue boxes from the top half of the grid, and mirror it below the red color shape in the bottom half of the grid, and then fill it with blue color. All other squares remain the same.\\\\n8. To make the output, you have to copy the blue grouping beneath the red grouping exactly where it was originally with respect to the red, filling all remaining black squares between the red grouping and the new blue grouping with blue as well. If there is not enough space under the red grouping for the blue one, just copy as much as possible.\\\\n9. To transform the input into the output, you\\\\\\'ve to recreate the shape made by the red cells beneath the blue location and invert it. The blue cells have to be copied into both rows and columns until reaching the border of the original red shape. Example: If you see a 3x1 red cell shape at the top, you place a 3x1 blue cell shape at the bottom.\\\\n10. To make the output, you have to reflect the top form directly beneath it, if there is no other color or form in between. If there\\\\\\'s a second form at the bottom half, this should get reflected upwards. If there\\\\\\'s a third from in the middle, this should get reflected both upwards and downwards. The reflection should happen in the same columns as the original form. If there\\\\\\'s a form obstructing the reflection, the obstructing form should stay as it is without being overlayed.\\\\n11. To make the output, you need to copy the blue line block, maintaining its placement in the grid, from the position of the topmost color area and paste it above the line of red blocks in the bottom-most color area. Fill in any black space in-between, keeping black spaces on either side, if it exists, within the area bounded by the red line. Leave the rest of the input grid, including the red blocks, unchanged to form the output grid.\\\\n12. To make the output, you have to take the single column or line of squares from the top-middle or middle-right respectively and copy it downwards or leftwards respectively to make a solid block filling up that half of the grid. The size and position of the block depends on the location of the original line or column.\\\\n13. Take the blue cross from the input grid and rotate it 90 degrees in clockwise direction. Place the rotated shape in the output at the same location where the line of red cells starts from in the input grid. If there exist any intervening cells on the positioning area, they should be replaced by the cells from the rotated shape. The rest of the grid remains the same in output as input.\\\\n14. The rule of transformation is focused on copying the top pattern to the area in the middle. We identify the very top pattern formed by cells of blue (1 value) and red (2 value) and copy it to the rows immediately above the bottom red (2 value) pattern. The size of the pattern replication stretches to the width of the grid, leading to the formation of a broader pattern. The bottom pattern from the input remains unchanged. If there is no pattern at the top, no change is performed.\\\\n15. To make the output, we copy the blue shape vertically to the positions based on the location of the red shapes in the input grid. The copied blue shape should be placed on top of the red shape if it exists. The remaining parts of the grid, not overlapping with the copied blue shapes or existing red shapes, should remain black.\\\\n16. To transform the input to the output grid, blue patterns from the top pattern are repeated in the row above the red pattern. If the blue pattern is a single column, it should be repeated column-wise, until it covers the block above the red pattern. If it is multiple columns, the entire pattern should be repeated as a block. This new repeated pattern gets placed right above the red pattern.\\\\n17. To make the output, you have to copy the blue horizontal line and place it into the space in front of the red line. The copied blue line turns into a grey line in the output.\\\\n18. To make the output, you have to clone the structure from top half until it occupies the space under it respectively, just right before the structure from the bottom half begins and change color to be equal to the top half. Keep the bottom\\\\\\'s original color unchanged.\\\\n19. To make the output, you have to identify the top group of colored cells (either blue or red) and replicate them below, modifying the color to blue. Locate the highest non-black cell and duplicate its row downwards till you encounter the next color. The newly filled cells become blue, regardless of the color of copied cell (either blue or red).\\\\n20. To make the output, you have to replicate the pattern in the opposite side of grid. Place it between the center line and original pattern on the opposite side. Each row of the pattern would repeat twice when replicated. If the pattern is on top half initially, the replicated pattern should be in blue color and if it\\\\\\'s on the bottom half, it should be in red color.\\\\n21. To make the output, you have to visualize the bottom-colored pattern (colored parts only, excluding black spaces), rotate it 180 degrees and place it so it fills the black empty space below the top-colored pattern. The result is an extension of the top-colored pattern downwards and the original bottom-colored pattern remains in its original position. The color of the extended pattern is the color of the top pattern in the input grid. The remaining parts of the grid stays intact.\\\\n22. To transform the input grid to get the output grid, firstly, identify the locations of the blue and red bars. Then, create a 4x4 blue square at the start (left-most point) of the red bar and maintain the original red bar in its place. Lastly, replace all other cells without any bar into black ones, if not already. Keep all other aspects of the input grid unchanged to achieve the desired output grid.\\\\n23. The transformation appears to be a reflection of the blue grid pattern onto each of the red lines. To make the output, simply copy the blue pattern onto the red lines, and mirror it vertically so it creates a reflection. The blue shapes are always copied from top to bottom. Note, the process is not a symmetry along the horizontal line in the middle of two red lines, but basically pasting a mirrored original blue pattern into the section divided by the red lines. The blue pattern remains the same after being pasted and its position is always starts from the top of the section.\\\\n24. To make the output, you need to duplicate the line denoted with \"1\" to the location where the \"2\" line is located. If there are previous elements at the new location, overwrite them. If there are elements from the \"2\" line that extend beyond the length of the \"1\" line, leave them intact. The position and length of the line formed by number \"2\" stays the same.\\\\n25. To make the output, you have to copy the blue shape with a red spot and mirror it horizontally towards the red lines. You should fill all the black space between the new mirrored shape and the red lines with the blue color. The red lines stay the same.\\\\n26. The transformation moves the blue shape down until it fills in the top of the red shape. If there isn\\\\\\'t a blue shape, nothing happens. The blue shapes leave a trail of blue that fills in the cells they were previously occupying. When the blue shape reaches the top of the red shape, it stops moving and stays on top of the red shape.\\\\n27. To make the output, you have to create a \"reflection\" from the blue shape across the horizontal axis of the grid to replace any original red shapes. Keep the rest of the grid black. The blue shape keeps its original position as well.\\\\n28. To make the output, first, find the topmost colored line. From there to its nearest colored line below, fill the spaces with the color of the line above. Repeat this until the grid is filled from top to bottom. Note that blue color (1) takes precedence so any repeated lines of color at the same vertical level should be filled with blue.\\\\n29. To make the output, you have to copy the small shape at the top left to the area starting from the left top corner of the large shape at the bottom right and below it. Imagine placing the small shape at the top left corner of the inside of large shape in bottom right corner and filling all cells to the bottom.\\\\n30. To generate the output, place the blue ship onto the area occupied by the red submarine while maintaining the spatial layout of blue color from the ship. The output grid should maintain the red color of the submarine and the black outline of both the ship and submarine. Keep the remaining cells black.\\\\n31. To make the output, you have to shift the first shape (the blue rectangle) downwards so that the top of the shape aligns with the bottom of the second shape (the red rectangle). Replace the points where the blue rectangle was with the same pattern (the blue rectangle itself). And finally, extend the blue pattern so that it reaches the left edge of the grid.\\\\n32. To generate the output, the red lines/shapes in the middle portion of the grid are copied and rotated clockwise 90 degrees by the center square. This copied shapes are then overlaid onto the red lines in the bottom portion of the grid. If there are any collisions between copied shapes and existing shapes, the copied shape replaces the existing shape.\\\\n33. To make the output, you have to reflect the blue figure downwards, mirroring it on the x-axis. The mirrored figure will be positioned directly above the existing lower red figure. The blue figure is replaced with blue and the top red figure is left unchanged.\\\\n34. To transform the grid you need to mirror the pattern on top and replicate around its counterpart below. If the pattern on top is composed of Blue cells then replicate taking into account the pattern of black cells around it. If it is composed of red cells then replicate it with blue colour taking into account the pattern of black cells around it. If there are more black cells surround the below pattern then fill the black cells with blue cells.\\\\n35. To achieve the output, you need to wrap the lower color cluster (blue if present) with upper color cluster (red). Fill the entire row of the lower color cluster with upper color cluster. If the lower color contains only one row, repeat it below until it takes the same number of rows as the original upper cluster.\\\\n36. To form the output, you have to identify the row with either the mixed (blue and red) or red line in the input grid. The output then mirrors the original input while replacing each black square below a colored square from this identified row with a blue square. Subsequently, the mirrored pattern of the blue squares extends downwards until it hits a red squares from the identified row or the row of red squares in the input grid, whichever comes first. The bottom row of red squares in the input grid, if present, is duplicated in the output grid.\\\\n37. To make the output, the block of red squares needs to be replicated vertically, every single line from that block must be copied starting from the line underneath till black cells are found. The transformation maintains the other colors in their original state and place.\\\\n38. To make the output, the contiguous leading blue cells from the input are firstly replicated above the blue cells in the lower part of the grid, filling out to the leftmost and rightmost edges of the grid. The blue cells present in the lower section are retained as they are. The pattern does not apply to the scattered red cells that may occur in the upper and lower portions of the grid. These remain as they are in the input grid.\\\\n39. To make the output, you have to mirror the red-blue triangle at the top, and draw it below the red-red triangle at the bottom. Fill all the empty spaces above the lower triangle with blue.\\\\n40. To make the output, you have to identify the two colored objects in the input. Now propagate or expand the blue object from the top to bottom but only until you encounter the red object. The red object acts as the boundary and doesn\\\\\\'t get replaced with blue. If there\\\\\\'s no red object in the way, fill the entire bottom part with blue until the end of the grid. The black and red cells remain as they are.\\\\n41. To make the output, the red shapes from wherever they are located on the input grid, are translated to the opposite vertical location (if they were on top, they go to the bottom, and vice versa), but maintain their horizontal positions, and take over the structure of the blue shape at that location. The shape of the copied red shape will duplicate the exact shape of the blue structure that it replaced. If the blue structure was within multiple adjacent grids, the red figure will occupy all those grids preserving the shape. All other elements in the grid remain stagnant and unchanged.\\\\n42. To make the output, draw a line of blue cells from the top of the blue arrow to the bottom of the grid, up until the start of the red arrow. The blue cells should take the same shape as the blue arrow, mirroring it along the vertical axis passing through the center black cell that divides the grid in two halves. Do not modify cells that fall under the red arrow.\\\\n43. To make the output, you have to draw an outline in blue (color 1) around the existing blue shape. For better clarity, think of this as a \\\\\\'halo\\\\\\' or \\\\\\'aura\\\\\\' around the shape. The outline should follow this rule:  1. Above the shape, draw a line of blue boxes the full width of the shape, starting and ending 1 box away from the shape\\\\\\'s left and right edges.   2. Below the shape, do the same.   3. To the left of the shape, draw a line of blue boxes the full height of the shape, starting and ending 1 box away from the shape\\\\\\'s top and bottom edges.   4. To the right of the shape, again do the same.   Essentially, you are making a blue \\\\\\'frame\\\\\\' around the shape in the input, and keeping everything else the same, including any other shapes in the input.\\\\n44. To transform the input into the output, a one-square wide blue rectangle is drawn such that it stretches from the blue line (if it exists) to the red rectangle, filling all squares in between. However, the red rectangle is left as is. Note that the blue rectangle also stretches to the margins of the grid, not just the width of the blue line. The blue rectangle is drawn regardless of whether the blue line exists or not. If the blue line doesn\\\\\\'t exist, the rectangle is drawn from the edge of the grid. If both the red rectangles and blue line don\\\\\\'t exist, no changes are made to the grid.\\\\n45. To make the output, you have to shift the smaller cluster of blue cells, respectively located in the upper left and lower right quadrant of the input, towards the centre, until they form an 3 cells deep extended cross bar based on the original position of the red cell. The rest of the grid stays the same, consisting of black cells.\\\\n46. To make the output, copy the \"upward arrow\" made of blue cells and paste it to the exact same location on the grid where the red \"downward arrow\" is, while keeping the original red \"downward arrow\". ########################################################################################################################################################################################\\\\n47. The transformation for the output involves a mirroring operation combined with a pattern replication. Here are the steps: 1. The pattern in the top left quadrant (single unit of 1\\\\\\'s with a single 2) is replicated horizontally to populate the entire top left quadrant in the output. 2. This replication is then mirrored along the vertical centerline of the grid to fill the bottom left quadrant in the output. 3. The pattern in the bottom right quadrant (triple repetition of 2\\\\\\'s) is preserved as is, without any changes or mirroring. 4. The top right quadrant in the output remains empty/solid black, just like in the input.   Note: The rule seems to preserve the empty/solid black in the top right, and any pattern in the bottom right, while duplicating the pattern from the top left quadrant into a new upper-half and reflecting it into the bottom left quadrant.\\\\n48. To make the output, the band of ones and red (2)s at the top defines a figure that is reproduced before the band of only red (2)s at the bottom. This figure is filled in with blue color (1). The rest of the grid remains black.\\\\n49. To transform the grid, identify the clusters of colored tiles. Each cluster forms a specific figure. For the transformations, the figures rotate by 180 degrees independently around their central point. As the figure rotates, it fills in black spaces it overlaps with the color of the figure. The original figure remains unaltered.  For example, in Case 0 Input: The blue \\\\\\'L\\\\\\' shaped figure and the double line of red tiles which are rotated by 180 degrees to occupy empty space in the Output. The original figures remain in their original position, and the newly filled colored spaces coexist with the original figures. This is done for all cases in a similar manner.\\\\n50. To create the output grid from the input, a blue buffer area must be added between the blue and red lines in the input grid. This blue buffer area corresponds to the width of the blue area above it, effectively replicating the blue stripes beneath them, between them and the red stripes. This transformation rule only applies to the blue stripes that directly precede the red stripes.\\\\n51. To make the output, you have to reflect the upper shape downwards toward the lower shape. The shapes merge into one, resulting in a bigger shape. Note: The reflection should align the right edges of the two shapes. If there are any black cells within the reflected shape, fill in blue cells to form a complete shape.\\\\n52. To make the output, you have to mirror the objects on the top half of the grid to the bottom half of the grid while maintaining the same distance from the horizontal centerline. If there are multiple objects, mirror them both and place them between the center and the original positions. The mirrored objects should be replaced by colored object with color 1.\\\\n53. To make the output, you have to copy and shift the blue values on top of the green ones. By shifting, it means that the pattern of blue cells roll down to the place of green cells and fill the area that the green shape would originally take, but keep the pattern of blue cells. Leave the rest of the grid black.\\\\n54. The cross made of red and green is transferred to the far right side into the largest free area (made up of black cells) where the tip of cross is at the same vertical position as the old one but in far right. The transferred cross should not overlap with any pre-existing colored cells and replace the black cells.\\\\n55. To make the output, you have to expand the upper shape down until it reaches the lower shape by repeating its pattern vertically, filling every row down to the one before the lower shape starts (if such a shape exists). Keep all other elements the same.\\\\n56. The transformation involves first identifying the first occurrence of the pattern 1 1 1. Then the transformation fills in 1s(marked as blue) in all cells of the same column, starting from the first occurrence of the pattern, up to, but not including, the next occurrence of the pattern (2 2 2). To make it clear, we are creating a \\\\\\'column\\\\\\' bridge of 1s (blue) between first sequence of 1s and second of 2s. For any rows with no 2 2 2 pattern, the grid remains the same.\\\\n57. To make the output, you have to first identify the blue cells (1) and red cells (2). The blue cells form an \\\\\\'I\\\\\\' pattern in the top-left quadrant of the grid and the red cells form a \\\\\\'-\\\\\\' pattern in the bottom-right quadrant. Now, in the output, the \\\\\\'I\\\\\\' pattern of blue cells must be repeated multiple times - just enough to fill the empty space until they reach the red \\\\\\'-\\\\\\' pattern. Hence, the transformation essentially involves replicating the blue \\\\\\'I\\\\\\' pattern to fill the empty space between the original blue and red configurations.\\\\n58. Each blue cell in the grid will replicate its shape in blue cells below it, up until the next blue cell or the bottom of the grid. The cells directly below the shape are turned blue, and this continues down until it hits another line of blue cells or the bottom of the grid. The shape should be a mirror image of the original and it should start directly underneath the original. This is essentially \"reflecting\" the blue shape about a horizontal line.\\\\n59. To make the output:  If there is a colored cell on the left hand side of the input grid, that cell\\\\\\'s color will fill an entire row starting from the left border and ending in the current cell column.  If there is a colored cell on the right hand side of the input grid, that cell\\\\\\'s color will fill an entire row starting from the current cell column and ending at the right border of the grid.  Black cells on both sides remain black in the output grid.\\\\n60. To make the output, a blue pattern needs to be drawn at the left side of the grid. The blue pattern matches the shape of the red pattern drawn in the input, but it is reflected horizontally and filled with blue squares. All squares that do not belong to the newly created blue pattern or the original red pattern will be black.\\\\n61. To make the output, you have to expand the blue diamond shape to meet the red diamond shape. After the expansion, the diamond shape should take the size and position of the red diamond while the red diamond keep it\\\\\\'s original size and position. The shape and position of the red diamond is not change. If there is no red diamond shape, leave the blue diamond shape as it is.\\\\n62. To transform the grid, identify the blue (value 1) and red (value 2) shapes. Blue shapes represent the \\\\\\'positive\\\\\\' signs and red shapes \\\\\\'negative\\\\\\'. Starting from the negative red shapes at the bottom and drawing upwards, duplicate the positive blue shape. The blue form should start at the row immediately above the red form and extend upwards. Stop duplicating when the blue shape reaches the same height as in the original image. Leave black cells (value 0) if there are no shapes.\\\\n63. To obtain the output, the transformation pattern is based on mirroring the blue shape present in the input grid, vertically along an axis formed by the red cross. The mirrored part is represented by a green color (1) in the output. In case the blue shape is on the both sides of the red cross in the input grid, no change is made. The red cross remains constant in the output grid. The cells that do not undergo any transformation remain black.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "Based on the similarities in the rules, they can be categorized into eight distinct categories as follows:\n\nCategory 1: Rules involving the movement of blue shapes towards red shapes or the bottom of the grid.\n- Rules: 1, 8, 26, 31, 40, 55, 58\n- Synthesized Rule: The topmost blue shape in the input grid moves downwards until it encounters a red shape or the bottom of the grid, filling all the black cells it passes with blue.

For each category, synthesize the rules into a single, specific rule that combines the ideas of all rules in that category, while clearly differentiating it from the other categories.\\\\nThe new rule should be as specific as possible, following the format of the given rules.\\\\nThe new rule should be applicable without any information from the original rules - i.e. it should be standalone.\\\\n\\\\nRules:\\\\n1. For transforming the grid from input to output, follow these steps:   1. Start at the top left corner of the input grid and move in left to right, top to bottom manner.  2. If the cell color is black, repeat as black cells in the output grid. 3. If the cell color is non-black, magnify the colored cell to a 4x4 square in the output grid. 4. Repeat steps 1-3 till you reach the last cell in the input grid.  Note that, the cells in the bottom-most row and right-most column are exception where the squares are shifted to align with the grid\\'s boundary.\\\\n2. To make the output, you have to check the nth column of the nth row and the 10th column of the nth row of the input. If a cell is colored, generate two rows at the top and the bottom of the output in which each color takes a 2x2 grid. Perform this for all n from 1 to 10. The rest of the cell in the output is black.\\\\n3. To make the output, you have to expand the input grid cells to fill the output grid. Each cell in the input grid is mapped to a 2x2 block in the output grid.   The structure is preserved and filled with a 4-times larger grid.   Every cell value that appears in the top row of the input needs to be replicated into a 4x4 cell grid in the top row of the output. The same is done for the color values that appear in the bottom row, but they are placed at the bottom part of the output grid.\\\\n4. To make the output, you have to replace each colored cell in the input with a corresponding 4x4 square of the same color in the output grid. The position of the color in the output grid should correspond to the input\\'s position, but at double the distance from the upper and left edge. All other cells in the output grid should be black. If there are several colored cells on the same row in the input, their corresponding squares in the output should also be on the same row, with black cells between them. Same goes for columns.\\\\n5. For each colored point in the input grid, a 4 by 4 square corresponding to that color has to be created in the output grid. Other cells in the output, for which there is no colored counterparts in the input, should be black. The overall layout of the output is preserved as in the input.\\\\n6. To make the output, you have to take the positions of the colored points in the input.  In each position where a color exists, create a 4x4 square of that color.   If colored points are at the same index, create a 4x4 square of color matching the color point in the first line (or row from the top) in the input. The squares should not overlap. Fill in the rest of the grid with black cells.\\\\n7. To obtain the output, for each colored pixel in the input, ensure it expands to a 4x4 square of the same color in the output. Maintain the position of expansion in the same grid sections. For black pixels, recreate the same in 4x4 squares in the corresponding positions in the output. This seems like a pixel magnification operation.\\\\n8. Each non-black cell (either it\\'s red, blue, purple, teal, or brown) and black cells between them in the input grid stretches into 4 cells wide in the output grid. The stretching method maintains the original color of the cells. All other black cells in the input grid stay black in the output grid.\\\\n9. You have to double the size of the grid in both vertical and horizontal axis. For each square with color, generate a 2x2 square with the same layout and color in the relative position in the output. Then, mirror this pattern horizontally within this new 2x2 square section. The mirroring should occur only for the colored blocks in the top and last row of the input grid while the rest of the grid cells remain black.\\\\n10. To make the output, you have to enlarge the colored dots from the input to a 4x4 square of the same color in the corresponding location in the output. Black squares in the input stay black in the output, even when enlarged. The pattern of the 1 to 2 colored dots is maintained when enlarging the grid.\\\\n11. To make the output, you have to scale the colored pixel from each row of the input using a factor of 4 such that the color and column of the pixel stays same. After scaling if the color is detected in the first or second column in the row then the color spreads for next 3 pixel in that row starting from the first column. If the color is in the middle two columns then it spreads from the fifth to the eighth column. If the color is in the last two columns then the color spreads from thirteenth to sixteenth column. If the color is in the last column then the color spreads from the seventeenth to the twentieth column. If the size of the input is not equal to 10 then the colour spreads in a similar way but to columns equal to double that of input size. The black pixels remain unchanged.\\\\n12. To make the output, you have to find the non-zero cells in the input grid and create a 4x4 square with the same color in the location on the output that corresponds to the input cell\\'s position, expanded by a factor of two. The rest of the cells in the output grid should remain black (0).\\\\n13. To make the output, you have to scale every color by a factor of 2 and push each colored shape to the first quadrant only i.e. in the top left of the grid.\\\\n14. To make the output, you have to enlarge the input grid by 2 times horizontally and vertically, maintaining the original colors of the non-black cells. Each non-black cell in input appears as a 4x4 square of the same color cells in the corresponding position in the output. Black cells in the input will remain black in the output.\\\\n15. To make the output, you have to enlarge each colored dot in the top line to a 4x4 square with the same color in the output. Repeat the same for the colored dots in the bottom line. All other cells stay black.\\\\n16. The non-black numbers close to the edges on the top, bottom, left and right are each transformed into a square of the same size as the total grid with corresponding color associated with the number. These squares of different colors should be placed in the same order in the output grid as they are in the input grid, but mirrored with respect to the centre. Hence the one that is closest to the centre in the input will be the outermost in the output. The rest of the output grid cells are black.\\\\n17. To make the output, you have to expand each cell of the input grid into 4 cells and replace the colored dots to fill half of the line they were previously in. The cells with black pixels should remain black. The order of colors from the left in the input corresponds with the order of colors from the top in the output after expanding. If two colored dots are in the same row of the input, they should form a combination in the output with the first color filling the left side and the second color filling the right side of the resultant row.\\\\n18. To make the output, you have to rotate the input grid 90 degrees counterclockwise, then quadruple the size. Each cell in the input is represented by a 4x4 block of the same color in the output.\\\\n19. To make the output, you have to select each row from the input grid separately. If the row consists of colored blocks, duplicate each colored block by four times so that it covers four blocks horizontally. If the row only contains black blocks, no transformation is needed, and you can duplicate it as it is. After applying these transformations to each row, repeat this processed row four times to form the final 20x20 grid. In summary, every colored block from the input has been transformed into a 4x4 colored grid in the output, while black blocks remain untouched.\\\\n20. To make the output, you have to take each individual colored dot from the input and convert it into a square block in the output of the same color. Each individual dot should become a 4x4 block in its corresponding position in the output. For instance, if a single red dot is located in the 2nd row and column in the input, it should become a 4x4 red square located in the 2nd to 5th rows and columns in the output.\\\\n21. To make the output, the transformation involves two procedures. First, you need to expand the input grid to double the original size. Then, for any colored cell in the input grid, create a 4x4 square with the same color at the corresponding location in the output grid.\\\\n22. To make the output, you have to iterate over the input grid if a colored cell is found then in the corresponding output grid location, convert that cell and the cells next to it (in all directions) with the same color in a 4x4 square. Keep the cells not affected by the above rule as black.\\\\n23. To make the output, you have to place the colored squares from the input grid in the output grid in the same places, but each square should be scaled up by a factor of 2. All other squares remain black.\\\\n24. To make the output, you have to first split each row of the input grid into two rows in the output. Then, the colored cell(s) will be copied four times to fill up four consecutive positions in the new row. The rest of the cells in the row will remain black. Repeat this for every row in the input and output.\\\\n25. To make the output, you have to enlarge the image by a scale factor of 2 in both dimensions. This means that every pixel in the input will be represented as a 2x2 square of the same color in the output. The whole transformation can be considered as an upscaling process.\\\\n26. To make the output, find the colored cells in the input and quadruple their dimension without changing their color and arrangement. Extend the area into four identical parts, effectively resulting to a 2x increase in size both lengthwise and heightwise.\\\\n27. To make the output, you have to perform the following steps on the colored cells in the input grid: 1. Extend each colored cell into a square of color, each side measuring 4 cells in length. If a colored cell is at the position (i, j), the corresponding square should be placed in the output grid within the range [2*i:2*i+4, 2*j:2*j+4]. 2. The rest of the output grid is filled with black cells.\\\\n28. To make the output, you need to take the colors in the top row and fill the first four rows with the first color and next four rows with the second color. Repeat the same with the colors on the bottom row but on the last 8 rows of the grid. All the remaining spaces in the middle of the grid should be filled with black.\\\\n29. To make the output, color every square with a value from the input should be repeated 4 times in the output, both horizontally and vertically. This operation can be explained as stretching the input pixels proportionally towards right and down to four times their original size.\\\\n30. To transform the input into the output, each cell in the input grid should be expanded to a 2x2 block in the output. The color of the cell in the input should match the color of the 2x2 block in the output. This process should be followed for all cells in the input, regardless of their color.\\\\n31. To make the output, you have to duplicate the size of each row and column by a factor of two and then proportionately inflate the colored cell by spreading it horizontally by a factor of two. Each row on the input grid maps directly to four rows on the output grid and each colored cell maps to a 4x4 block on the output grid. The color of the 4x4 block on the output grid is the same as the color of the corresponding cell on the input grid. All black cells remain the same.\\\\n32. The grid transformation requires expanding the entire 10x10 grid by a factor of two. Coloured cells become a 4x4 square of that colour while black cells remain as four black cells grouped together.\\\\n33. To make the output, you have to expand each 1x1 colored square in the input to a 4x4 colored square in the same color. These enlarged squares should be placed in the same location relative to the grid. All the blank (black) spaces remain the same size and location.\\\\n34. To transform it, each colored cell needs to be expanded to a 4x4 square of the same color in the respective position in the output grid.  The rest remains black.\\\\n35. The transformation from the input grid to the output grid takes each cell of the input and magnifies it into a 2x2 block in the output with the color identified by the input cell number.   For example, if a cell in the input grid is marked as 1 (blue), it will translate to a 2x2 blue square in the output grid. Empty or black cells in the input are also magnified into a 2x2 black block in the output.   Furthermore, in the output grid, each colored block is positioned in a quadruple size location, mirroring its position in the input grid.   Specifically, the cell colors are projected downward in the Y axis, hence, if a color-coded cell in the input grid appears closer to the bottom, it will also appear closer to the bottom in the output grid.\\\\n36. For colored cells (non-zero entries) in the input, expand each cell to fill a 4x4 sub-grid of the same color in the output.  Keep the horizontal arrangement of these expanded cells the same as in the input. The rest of the cells (zeros in input) remain as zero (black) in the output.\\\\n37. To make the output, you have to mirror each row of the input in horizontal direction, and double each individual cell, quadrupling the total grid size. Subsequently, the second half of each row will be filled with black cells. For instance, a single blue cell in the input will become a 2x2 square of blue cells in the corresponding quadrant of the output, and the other part of this row will remain black.\\\\n38. To make the output, you have to expand each colored cell from the input grid into a 4x4 square of the same color in the corresponding location in the output grid. Keep all the black cells as is.\\\\n39. To make the output, you have to locate the any colored dots from the input at their respective positions in the output while enlarging them 4 times their initial size. All other positions in the output grid must be black.\\\\n40. The transformation rule is that each colored pixel is expanded to a 4x4 pixel of the same color in the corresponding position on the output grid. The black pixels in the input grid stay the same size in the output, they don\\'t expand.\\\\n41. To make the output, you have to locate the color pixel in each row of the input grid. Duplicate the entire row lining up the color pixels at the center of output row and also extend the color pixels to fill a square block at the center of output row. If the input row is entirely black, maintain the same row in output.\\\\n42. - All colored cells in the first row of the input transform to a 4x4 square of the same color in the first four rows of the output.  - All colored cells in the last row of the input transform to a 4x4 square of the same color in the last four rows of the output.  - The rest of the output\\'s cells are black.\\\\n43. To make the output, you have to double the size of the grid. All colored squares in the input grid must be four times larger, forming a 4x4 box of the same color in the output grid. The rest of the output grid should be filled with black cells, including all places not occupied by the enlarged boxes.\\\\n44. To make the output, you have to take each non-black cell in the input (in their order of appearance from left to right, top to bottom) and create a 4x4 square of the same color in the output. The first non-black cell will be transformed into a 4x4 square in the top-left of the output, and subsequently transformed non-black cells will form 4x4 squares to the right of any existing ones. If there\\'s no space to the right, start from the most left in a new line below. Black cells in the input are ignored.\\\\n45. To make the output, you have to scan the input grid from top to bottom, left to right. Once a colored cell is encountered, it is expanded into a 4x4 block in the output grid. The position of this block relative to the output grid\\'s gridlines is the same as the colored cell\\'s position relative to the input grid\\'s gridlines. All other cells are black in the output grid.\\\\n46. To make the output, you have to first scale the input grid to twice the size. Each cell expands to a 2x2 domain with the same color. After that, shift each colored area 2 cells to the right from its original position in the input as follows: the points in the left part of the original grid moves to the left part of the output grid, the point in the right part of the original grid moves to the right part of the output grid. The rest cells are colored in black.\\\\n47. To make the output, you have to identify the colored dot in each row and column of the input, then recreate a 4x4 square of the same color in the same location on the output. The transformation also involves expanding the output grid towards the right and down by a magnitude of 2.\\\\n48. To make the output, you have to enlarge each individual cell from the input to a 2x2 size while maintaining their colors and position in the output grid.\\\\n49. The transformation involves enlarging or amplifying the size of the original grid and as well as the colored points. The original 10x10 grid becomes a 20x20 grid. The colors are also duplicated into a 4x4 square instead of a single point. In the input, each color, if it exists, appear as single points in two consecutive cells of a row. If translated to color, it should be visible as a line extending from top to bottom with a specific color assigned to each line depending on the number.  The color mapping is as follows: 1:blue; 2:red; 3:green; 4:yellow; 8:teal. For black cells or empty backgrounds, it is represented by 0. The colors in the output grid are expanded such that each point from the input is now a 4x4 block in the output.\\\\n50. To make the output, you have to expand each cell in the input grid to a 2x2 square in the output grid. If the input cell has a colored number, reproduce this number in the corresponding 2x2 square in the output grid. If the input cell is blank, leave the corresponding 2x2 square in the output grid blank as well.\\\\n51. To transform the input into the output grid, observe the color of the points on the input grid (non-black cells). Then, for each colored point, you create a grid patch of 4x4 of the same color in the corresponding position in the output grid. All other cells in the output remain black.\\\\n52. To make the output grid, you have to scale up the original 10x10 grid by a factor of 2, expanding in both horizontal and vertical directions. Each non-black cell entry in the input grid should be expanded into a 4-cell square in the corresponding location in the output. The rest of the grid remains black. Colored cells retain their original color in the output.\\\\n53. To generate the output grid, we first double the size of the input grid by replicating each cell of the input in a 2x2 block in the output grid. If a cell in the input grid contains a colored cell (non-zero number), the cells in the corresponding 2x2 output block will contain that number. If a cell in the input grid is black (contains a zero), the cells in the corresponding 2x2 output block will also be black.\\\\n54. To make the output, you have to replicate (or mirror) each colored square in the input on a 2x2 level in the output. So for each colored square (non-zero number) in the input, it should become a 2x2 square of the same color in the output. For black squares (zero number), leave them black in the output. The overall layout of the colors should match the input, just larger due to the replication of squares.\\\\n55. To make the output, you have to enlarge the grid by a factor 2. Following this, each colored cell in the input grid is blown up into a 4x4 square of that color in the output. The cell locations are relative to the direction of the blow up. In each 4x4 section, if the top left cell is blue in the input, then all four cells in the top left corner of the output are blue. This same operation is applied for other colors as well.\\\\n56. To make the output, you have to enlarge every cell from the input grid (which is one-colored square) into a 2x2 block of that same color in the output grid. For example, a single 3 in the input grid becomes a 2x2 block filled with 3s in the output grid, and a single 4 in the input becomes a 2x2 block filled with 4s in the output. The position of the 2x2 squares in the output grid is the same as the position of the original cells in the input grid (scaled by a factor of 2). Black empty spaces (0s) in the input are similarly turned into 2x2 blocks of zeros(0s) in the output.\\\\n57. To make the output, you have to take the significant number from each row of the input grid, and then expand it to fill a 4x4 block in the corresponding area of the output array having that same row number. The colors should retain their original values, and zeros remain as zeros.\\\\n58. To create the output grid, every color point on the input should be enlarged to a 4x4 square in the same color. The relative positioning should be preserved. The empty black spaces are enlarged in the same way, with a 1x1 black square becoming a 4x4 black square.\\\\n59. To make the output, you have to double the grid both horizontally and vertically, and for colored shapes, you need to quadruple them horizontally and vertically. The empty grids remain as is. In essence, you\\'re transforming each individual cell from the input into a 4x2 cell in the output, with the color of the original cell filling the newly formed cells.\\\\n60. To make the output, enlarge the grid by copying every row and every column two times. Distribution of colors remain the same. Meaning, if a row or column in input had a colored square, the corresponding row or column in the output will have four consecutive squares of the same color.\\\\n61. Each cell of the grid that has a color form a square of the same color of size 4x4 in the corresponding position in the output grid. The exception is the black cells which size remains the same in the output grid. Ordering of rows and columns is retained from the input to output.\\\\n62. To make the output: - First, find if there are color cells in the first or last line of the input. - If there are colored cells, map them to a 4x4 square of the same color in the first or last four lines of the output correspondingly. - All the other cells stays black.\\\\n\"}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "Category 1: Rules that involve magnifying the entire grid, including black cells.\n- Rule 1\n- Rule 3\n- Rule 7\n- Rule 8\n- Rule 14\n- Rule 25\n- Rule 26\n- Rule 30\n- Rule 32\n- Rule 48\n- Rule 52\n- Rule 53\n- Rule 56\n- Rule 61\n\nSynthesized Rule: To make the output, you have to magnify the entire input grid, including black cells, by a factor of 2.

For each category, synthesize the rules into a single, specific rule that combines the ideas of all rules in that category, while clearly differentiating it from the other categories.\\\\nThe new rule should be as specific as possible, following the format of the given rules.\\\\nThe new rule should be applicable without any information from the original rules - i.e. it should be standalone.\\\\n\\\\nRules:\\\\n1. The output grid is created by placing the input grid on top of a vertically reflected copy of itself, essentially mirroring the input grid along the horizontal axis. The top half of the output grid is the reflected copy of the input, and the bottom half is the original input grid.\\\\n2. To make the output, you have to mirror the input grid along a horizontal axis in the middle of the grid. This results in the top half of the grid being a mirror image of the bottom half, effectively duplicating the original input grid.\\\\n3. To make the output, you have to mirror the input grid across the horizontal axis, meaning that the last row becomes the first row, the second-last row becomes the second row, and so on. Then, this transformed grid should be placed below the original to complete the full output grid.\\\\n4. To make the output, you have to take the input and flip it vertically, then concatenate the flipped version to the original version. Therefore, the output grid is formed by the original grid maintained at the bottom and its vertical reflection appended at the top.\\\\n5. The grid transformation involves mirroring the input grid along the horizontal central axis to generate a new grid below the original one creating a 6x4 grid. This essentially doubles the size of the grid, with the second half being a reversed copy of the first half.\\\\n6. To make the output, you have to flip the input grid vertically and then duplicate it. The output grid should contain two copies of the input grid, top to bottom, where the first is reflected along the horizontal axis from the original, and the second is exactly the same as the original.\\\\n7. To make the output, you need to mirror/reflect the input grid horizontally, then concatenate the input grid and its mirror image vertically to form the output. In other words, copy the input grid, reverse its order from top to bottom, then attach it to the bottom of the original grid.\\\\n8. To make the output, we need to mirror flip the input grid along the horizontal central axis, and then stack it under the original input grid to get the output grid.\\\\n9. To make the output, you have to flip the input grid vertically and then append it to the bottom of the original grid. This means the first row of the output is the last row of the input and the fourth row of the output is the first row of the input repeated. The fifth and sixth rows of the output should be the same as the first and second rows of output, completing the repeating pattern.\\\\n10. To transform the input grid to the output grid, first copy the entire grid, then flip it vertically to create a mirror image. Repeat this process one more time to get a grid that is three times the height of the original grid, where the top and bottom sections are mirror images of the middle section.\\\\n11. To make the output, you should duplicate the input grid and append it to itself, but the second copy must be flipped vertically, looking like a mirror reflection.\\\\n12. To make the output, you have to mirror the original grid along the horizontal axis in the center of the grid so that the lower half is an upside-down copy of the upper half.\\\\n13. To create the output pattern, the original 3x4 rectangle should be flipped vertically. The flipped rectangle should then be attached to the bottom of the original rectangle, resulting in a 6x4 grid.\\\\n14. To make the output, you have to duplicate the input 3x4 colored grid in the output, then flip and copy the original grid vertically to the bottom of the original copy. The result is a 6x4 grid with the rows arranged in a pattern of: 3rd, 2nd, 1st, 1st, 2nd, 3rd.\\\\n15. To make the output, you have to mirror the original input grid along a horizontal axis located in the middle, creating a reflection of 3 rows below the original ones. This will yield a grid with 6 rows instead of 3. After mirroring the input grid, the bottom 3 rows will be an exact replica of the initial grid.\\\\n16. To make the output, you have to vertically mirror the original grid and then stack the original grid on top of the mirrored version so that the original grid is on the bottom.\\\\n17. To transform the input grid into the output grid, flip the input grid vertically and then append the original input grid to the bottom of the flipped grid.\\\\n18. To make the output, reverse the order of the rows in the input and then duplicate every row in the new reversed grid. This means that the bottom row in the input will be the top two rows in the output, the middle row in the input will be the middle two in the output, and the top row in the input will be the bottom two rows in the output.\\\\n19. To make the output, flip the whole input vertically and duplicate it. The result should be the input grid on top and its vertically reversed version just below it.\\\\n20. To get the output from the input, make a mirrored copy. Duplicate the matrix, and then reverse the order of the entire rows for the copied part. This results in the original matrix on top and its flipped version on the bottom.\\\\n21. To get from the input to the output, take the input grid, and then make a copy of it, but flipped vertically. This means that rows in the input are reversed in their copy. Append the copied and flipped grid to the input grid.\\\\n22. To make the output, you have to take the mirror image of the input grid along the horizontal axis and attach it to the bottom of the original grid.\\\\n23. To make the output, you have to flip the whole grid vertically and superimpose the original grid on it. This means the first row of the original grid is the third row in the output grid and the last row of original grid is the middle row in output grid. Then, it repeats back the rows till the end.\\\\n24. To make the output, you have to take the input and reflect it about the horizontal axis. The output is essentially a vertical mirror image of the input, repeated once.\\\\n25. To make the output, you have to first flip the input grid upside down, and then take the flipped grid and place it again underneath the original grid with the NOW upside down orientation. Essentially, the output grid is formed by stacking the original grid and a vertically flipped copy of the original grid.\\\\n26. To make the output, you have to mirror the input downwards, ie. the bottom row of the input becomes the top row of the output, and vice versa. This mirroring repeats so that the bottom half of the output is a mirror image of the top half.\\\\n27. To make the output, form a new grid by inverting the order of rows of the input pattern and duplicating the entire grid one over the other, keeping the original grid on top.\\\\n28. To achieve the output, the input grid is flip vertically and then stacked on top of the original, thus repeating the input grid content in an inverted fashion, doubling the number of rows in the process.\\\\n29. To make the output, you have to mirror the input grid along the middle horizontal line. Imagine that you placed a mirror at the center of the input grid and reflected the top half down. The result will be a repetition of the original grid.\\\\n30. To make the output, you need to first mirror the input grid along the horizontal axis. Then, append the mirrored grid to the bottom of the original grid.\\\\n31. To make the output, you have to copy the rows of the input grid, but in reversed order, and then append these reversed rows at the end. The order of the numbers in each row does not change, only the sequence of the rows changes. This transformation can be described as a vertical reflection, followed by a duplication of the reflected grid.\\\\n32. To transform the grid, you have to take the rows of the input grid, read from bottom to top, and then repeat this pattern again. This will form the output grid. So, the last row of the input becomes the first row of the output, and the first row of the input will also become the fourth row of the output. This pattern repeats for the second and third rows of the input grid as well.\\\\n33. To make the output, you have to flip the input matrix along its horizontal central axis and then append the original grid to the flipped grid. Thus, you end up with a cascading pattern that appears to be a reflection along the horizontal middle line. This transformation effectively duplicates the original grid while mirroring the color patterns.\\\\n34. To make the output, you have to mirror the input grid along the horizontal middle (mirror top to down), resulting in a doubling of the rows in the input grid to produce a 6 by 4 output grid.\\\\n35. To get the output from the input, we flip the input vertically and then repeat it. This results in a grid where the pattern of the input grid is repeated, but each repetition has the pattern of the input grid being inverted vertically.\\\\n36. To make the output, you have to flip the input grid along the horizontal axis (mirroring of the input along the x-axis), and appends the flipped grid below the original grid.\\\\n37. To make the output, you have to reflect (or flip) the input grid along the horizontal central axis, and then append this reflected version at the bottom of the original input grid to create a new grid which is double in size with repeated patterns.\\\\n38. To make the output, you need to mirror the input grid vertically around its middle row. The mirrored grid should then be appended to the original input grid to form a new 6x4 grid.\\\\n39. To make the output, you have to mirror the input grid along the horizontal axis to create the bottom half of the output grid, resulting in a grid that is twice as tall as the input grid.\\\\n40. To make the output, you have to flip the whole grid vertically, so the top row becomes the bottom row and vice versa. Then, duplicate the flipped grid so you double its size vertically, achieving a 6 row by 4 column grid.\\\\n41. To make the output, you have to mirror the input grid along a horizontal axis in the middle of the grid. The top row becomes the bottom row, the second row becomes the second last row and likewise. Then copy these mirrored rows again. Therefore, each row in the input has a duplicate in the output.\\\\n42. To make the output, you have to reflect the pattern of the input grid over the horizontal axis, resulting in a 6x4 grid where the top half is a reflected version of the bottom half.\\\\n43. To make the output, you have to mirror the image along the horizontal axis. This means replicating the exact grid upside down below the initial one.\\\\n44. To transform the grid, mirror the input by appending the same 3x4 grid upside down. Thus, the output grid is twice as tall as the input.\\\\n45. To make the output, you have to replicate the input grid twice. The bottom grid becomes the top grid and vice versa. This forms a pattern of 2 grids having the same values.\\\\n46. To make the output, you have to reflect the input matrix along one of its horizontal (mid) axis and append it to the original matrix. Essentially, duplicating the original matrix in an upside down manner right beneath it.\\\\n47. To make the output, you have to copy the input grid vertically and then reverse the order of all the rows. The top grid in the output should be the reversed order of the input grid and the lower grid in the output should be a copy of the input grid.\\\\n48. To make the output, you have to duplicate each row in the input grid in the corresponding position in the output grid. Then, repeat this sequence once more below it. This process will form a mirror image of the shapes along a horizontal axis.\\\\n49. To make the output, you have to copy the entire grid of the input and paste it below the original, however, the copied version should be vertically flipped. Combine the original grid and the copied flipped grid to obtain a complete 6x4 grid.\\\\n50. To make the output, you have to duplicate the input grid and append it vertically in reverse order. Giving the effect of reflecting the grid along the horizontal axis and stacking it.\\\\n51. To create the output, you have to mirror the input grid along a horizontal axis line passing through the center of the input. This mirror operation duplicates the input and appends it to the bottom of original. Essentially, you have two copies of the input, with the second one being a vertically flipped version of the first.\\\\n52. To make the output, start by taking the input grid and reflect it along the horizontal central axis. Then, append this reflection to the end of the original grid. The pattern is essentially duplicating the original grid and flipping it vertically.\\\\n53. To make the output, you have to flip the original grid along a horizontal central axis to create a mirrored pattern. Duplicate the mirrored pattern from top to bottom. This is equivalent to repeating the original grid twice, once in its original form and once in its vertically mirrored form.\\\\n54. To make the output, you must reflect the input grid downward along its middle row axis, and append this reflection to the original grid.\\\\n55. To make the output, you have to duplicate the input grid horizontally and then, flip the complete set over the vertical axis.\\\\n56. To make the output, you have to duplicate the input grid and append it to the bottom but flip it vertically. So, the top half of the output grid is a vertically flipped version of the input and the bottom half of the output is a copy of the input grid.\\\\n57. To make the output, you have to reflect the input grid along the horizontal axis, adding it onto the bottom of the original grid. This essentially doubles the number of rows, making the bottom half of the grid a reflection of the top half.\\\\n58. To make the output, you have to keep the same pattern as the input but you have to mirror it along the horizontal central line. That means you repeat the input pattern once and then you repeat it in the reverse order.\\\\n59. The transformation involves flipping the original 3x4 block vertically, resulting in a mirrored image below the original structure to form a 6x4 block. This creates a symmetrical pattern along the horizontal axis right through the middle of the grid.\\\\n60. To make the output, you have to flip the input grid upside down and then duplicate the flipped version below the original. The resulting grid has a mirror symmetry along the middle horizontal axis.\\\\n61. To make the output grid, you have to mirror the full input grid over a horizontal axis situated at the middle of the input grid. The content of the original grid is then repeated, but in reverse order.\\\\n62. To make the output, you have to mirror the original 3-row grid vertically. This means that the first row becomes the last row, the second row becomes the second last row, and the third row stays in the middle and becomes a mirror axis. The result is an output grid with two identical 3-row patterns.\\\\n63. To make the output, you have to vertically flip the input grid and append this flipped version to the original input grid. This will double the height of the grid.\\\\n64. To make the output, you have to duplicate the rows in the original input grid and then reverse the sequence of these duplicates. The first row becomes the third and the third row becomes the first in the duplicate grid. The original grid and the manipulated duplicate are then stacked on top of each other to form the 6x4 grid.\\\\n'}]\", 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "After analyzing the rules, it's clear that they all describe the same process of transforming an input grid into an output grid.

For the transformation, the vertical grey \"bars\" remain the same. Between each pair of bars, colored segments are changed into three rows of constant color, where each color corresponds to the original color + 5. The left-most segment turns into the color corresponding to the number 2 plus 5 (i.e. 7, which corresponds to orange). The middle segment turns into the color corresponding to the number 1 plus 5 (i.e. 6, which corresponds to fuchsia). The right-most segment turns into the color corresponding to number 3 plus 5 (i.e. 8, teal).\\\\n2. To make the output, you have to change the color of black cells depending on the color of the colored cell on the same horizontal line. If the colored cell is blue, then the black cells on that horizontal line should change to fuschia. If the colored cell is red, then the black cells on that horizontal line should change to orange and so on. Basically, increment +5 to each black cell corresponding the value of colored cell on same horizontal line. But keep the color of grey cells same as they are in the input. The color-to-number mapping should be as follows: Blue (1) => Fuchsia (6), Red (2) => Orange (7), Green (3) => Teal (8), Yellow (4) => Brown (9)\\\\n3. To make the output, you have to first look at the middle cell of each section. The transformation depends on the color of the mid-cell. From blue, it changes to fuschia. Red changes to Orange. Green changes to teal. Yellow changes to Grey. After dealing with the mid-cells, fill the empty cells between the grey lines with specific colors based on the mid-cell color. A fuschia center color fills adjacent cells orange, and orange center fills them with teal. Teal-filled cells around the middle can fill the remaining ones with grey, and grey fills the remaining with Fuschia. Grey vertical lines remain unchanged.\\\\n4. To make the output, you have to replace the black cells with a fuschia colour. The surrounding areas of the grey cells to the right are to be replaced with teal cells and those to the left with brown cells. The color in the middle of the grey cells determines the colour of its surrounding cells, blue turns the surroundings into brown cells, red turns them into fuschia cells, green turns them to teal cells and yellow into brown colour cells. The grey cells retain their colour.\\\\n5. The transformation process is as follows:  - The columns of 5\\\\\\'s in the input grid remain unchanged in the output.  - For the cells adjacent to these 5\\\\\\'s column, they are filled with a number equal to the middle column number between the two 5\\\\\\'s columns plus 5.  - This pattern of filling cells adjacent to the 5\\\\\\'s column is repeated, filling out the remaining cells in the row with the same number obtained above. But if the Input grid has a divider (represented by a row or column filled with 5), we follow the same pattern for the different sections separated by the divider.\\\\n6. To transform the input into the output, you have to paint the area around the grey line with a different color according to the colored number in that area, in this order: blue -> fuschia, red -> orange, green -> teal, and so on. The areas remain separated by the grey line.\\\\n7. To create the output grid, each unique colored square between the grey segments is mapped to a new color. Blue squares are turned to fuschia, red squares are turned to orange, green squares are turned to teal, and grey squares are turned to brown. In addition, these colored patterns, once changed, span across the whole line, replacing the black squares. The grey squares remain the same. For cases with more than one pattern set, the process is repeated after the full grey line.\\\\n8. To make the output, you have to replace all black cells with the color from the middle cell of each section in the order of blue, red, green, fuschia, orange (1, 2, 3, 4, 7). So, any black cell that was in the blue section should become teal (6), any black cell that was in the red section should become orange (7) and so on. The grey cells should remain as is.\\\\n9. To produce the output, we add +5 to the colored numbers found in the columns 2,5 and 10 of the input grid. The grey lines and black cells remain the same. If the input has multiple sections divided by the grey lines, then perform the same operation in each section separately.\\\\n10. To produce the output grid, the first color (blue, 1) is replaced by fuschia (6), the second color (red, 2) is replaced by orange (7), the third color (green, 3) is replaced by teal (8) and the fourth color (yellow, 4) is replaced by brown (9). Black and grey (5) spaces remain the same. Repeat this process for both sections(if present) separately.\\\\n11. To make the output, you have to change all the black cells, of three cells block to the left and right of the grey-bar, to fuchsia or teal or light blue or yellow or brown based on whether the color cell in the middle is blue or red or green i.e., it\\\\\\'s based on the original color cell order. The color of the cells in the middle row on left of gray bar is replaced by numbers starting from 6 to 9 for the original colors blue, red, green and yellow respectively. For the cells to the right of gray bar, the colors are replaced in an ascending order starting from 6(i.e., whichever color is present in the middle row on left gray bar after 5th column is replaced from 6 and so on). The fifth column in grey remains the same.\\\\n12. To make the output, replace the set of three black cells for each colored line on the left with fuschia, each grey colored line with teal, and each on the right with orange, brown, or yellow (for blue, red, and green respectively). The grey lines in the middle and the full grey row, if one exists, remain unchanged.\\\\n13. To make the output, you can map each colored cell to 3 numerical values ahead on the color scale (blue (1) maps to fuschia (4), red (2) maps to grey (5), green (3) maps to orange (6)). Fill the cells in the column of the colored cell with the corresponding color mapped from the color number. The teal cells remain the same.\\\\n14. The transformation rules are as follows:   - If the color in the middle row of the input box is 1, the output should be filled with color 6. - If the color in the middle row of the input box is 2, the output should be filled with color 7. - If the color in the middle row of the input box is 3, the output should be filled with color 8. - If the color in the middle row of the input box is 4, the output should be filled with color 9.  - The row filled with color 5 in the input is copied to the output without any changes.   So for each input block, observe the pattern of colors in the middle row and fill the whole block in the output as per the rules.\\\\n15. To transform the grid, the blue (1), red (2) and green (3) colors in the input are replaced by three different colors: fuchsia (6), orange (7), and teal (8) respectively in the first instance and they are incremented by one in each subsequent section separated by the gray (5) vertical lines.   So: - blue (1) becomes fuchsia (6) in the first block and onwards it increases as teal (8), brown (9), then back to fuchsia (6). - red (2) becomes orange (7) in the first block and onwards it increases as brown (9), fuchsia (6), and then back to orange (7). - green (3) becomes teal (8) in the first block and onwards it increases as fuchsia (6), orange (7), and then back to teal (8).   The gray (5) columns retain their color in the output. Black (0) cells become teal (8) cells.\\\\n16. To make the output, you have to replace the black cells with either fuschia or yellow, and grey cells with orange ones. Specifically, if the color of the block in the grey line is blue, the black cells in the same line in the output are replaced with fuschia. If the color of the block in the grey line is red, the black cells in the same line in the output are replaced with yellow. If the color of the block in the grey line is green, the black cells in the same line in the output are replaced with teal. If the color of the block in the grey line is purple, the black cells in the same line in the output are replaced with orange. The teal blocks in the input are always replaced with orange blocks in the output.\\\\n17. To generate the output, you need to take the number present in the cells of the input grid (other than gray and black cells), add 5 to it and replace all the black cells in that section with that summed number. Retain the gray cells at their original positions. Note: The output color sequence will be fuchsia, teal, orange, and brown for the input colors blue, red, green, and brown respectively.\\\\n18. To produce the output, you must look at the number on each side of the yellow row in the input and switch it with fuchsia (6) if it is blue (1), orange (7) if it\\\\\\'s red (2), teal (8) if it\\\\\\'s green (3), and brown (9) if it\\\\\\'s yellow (4). Then duplicate the result on each corresponding side of the yellow bar. The yellow bar itself remains unchanged.\\\\n19. Each grey cell should be replaced with a color according to the pattern in the blue cells. The number in the blue cells should be incremented by 5. For instance, cells around the blue cell with number \\\\\\'1\\\\\\' should be painted in fuschia (\\\\\\'1+5\\\\\\' gives color \\\\\\'6\\\\\\'), cells around blue cell with the number \\\\\\'2\\\\\\' should be painted in orange (\\\\\\'2+5\\\\\\' gives color \\\\\\'7\\\\\\'), and so on.\\\\n20. The pattern involves a conversion from 1-blue, 2-red and 3-green, 4-yellow spaces to be replaced by 6- fuschia, 7-orange, 8-teal, 9-brown multiple blocks respectively. The grey lines remain unchanged from the input to output.\\\\n21. Based on the middle number in each three-column module, replace the black cells. If the middle number is 1, replace black cells with fuschia; if it\\\\\\'s 2, replace with orange; if it\\\\\\'s 3, replace with teal; if it\\\\\\'s 4, replace with brown. The grey cells and their flanking red cells stay in place. If there\\\\\\'s a row of only grey cells, leave it as it is and replace black in modules above and below as it\\\\\\'s normally done.\\\\n22. To make the output, you have to map each colored number to the next number in the sequence (blue -> red -> green -> fuschia -> grey). You will keep the grey numbers (5) as it is. The black borders should be colored fuschia (6). Each new color corresponds to a new, incrementing number: blue becomes fuchsia (1 -> 6), red becomes teal (2 -> 7), green becomes orange (3 -> 8), and fuchsia becomes brown (4 -> 9).   Note that if there is a grey line dividing the input grid into two parts, consider the numbering separately for the two sections.\\\\n23. To make the output, you have to replace each factor of color in the input with another color in the output, according to the following pattern: blue (1) is replaced by fuchsia (6), red (2) is replaced by orange (7), green (3) is replaced by teal (8), and yellow (4) is replaced by brown (9). These changes are made while keeping the grey (5) stripes intact. Every three stripes, separated by two grey stripes, are manipulated in the same way, with each color being one unit higher than the corresponding color in the previous group of three. The pattern repeats after yellow (4). That\\\\\\'s why, in the fourth case, red (2) is replaced by orange (7) again, not by the color one number higher than brown(10) since it doesn\\\\\\'t exist.\\\\n24. The transformation of the grid involves the four non-grey squares in the rows before and after grey squares.  According to the number on non-grey squares in the input grid:  - if the number is 1 (blue): fill the corresponding quadrant in output by number 6 (fuschia); - if the number is 2 (red): fill the corresponding quadrant in output by number 7 (orange); - if the number is 3 (green): fill the corresponding quadrant in output by number 8 (teal); - if the number is 4 (yellow): fill the corresponding quadrant in output by number 9 (brown).  Keep the grey squares at the same position in the output grid.\\\\n25. To create the output, we need to replace the three dots in each section according to their color. Blue dot should be replaced with fuschia, red dot should be replaced with orange, and green dot should be replaced with teal. The number immediately following fuschia, orange, or teal should be yellow, except when the following number is grey. The rest of the grid should be transformed into teal. Note that a section here is bordered by grey lines and the grid boundaries.\\\\n26. The transformation involves a color increment for each colored number except for colors represented by the grey line. If black or grey squares are met they are left as they are. To be more precise : - Replace the blue values (1) by grey values (6), - Replace the red values (2) by orange values (7), - Replace the green values (3) by fuschia values (8), - Replace the yellow values (4) by teal values (9)  - Do not change the value of the grey line (5). The other cells are fuchsia(6).\\\\n27. The pattern that converts the input grid to the output grid follows a mapping based on the color blocks found within the black blocks. Blue color (1) transforms to brown (6), red color (2) to fuschia (7), green color (3) to teal (8), and grey color (4) to orange (9). The formation of the blocks and their color then replicates across the entire row (excluding the grey row).\\\\n28. To make the output, you have to look at the second row from the top and the second row from the bottom, both rows contain numbers from 1 to 4. Numbers 1 to 4 should be transformed into 6 to 9 respectively, and the new number should fill the corresponding column, but 5s should remain the same. Also, for larger grids, if a row of 5s separates two number-containing rows, the transformation should occur independently above and below this row.\\\\n29. To make the output, you have to assign a new color to each current color found in the center of each lane. The transformation is as follows: blue changes to fuschia, red to orange, green to teal, and yellow to brown. After the transformation, fill the entire lane with the new color.\\\\n30. To make the output, you have to replace each colored cells in the segments with a new color depending on the original color:  -   Blue cells (1) transform to Fuschia (6),  -   Red cells (2) transform to Orange (7),  -   Green cells (3) transform to Teal (8),  -   Grey cells (4) transform to Brown (9).  Keep the yellow line the same and fill in the rest of the region (previously black cells) with associated color transformations. In Case 3, repeat the procedure for each separated region above and below the yellow line.\\\\n31. To make the output, you have to  change the black cells of the input grid to purple cells and numbers represented by specific colors  (blue, red, green, and yellow) are transformed to corresponding numbers represented by specific colors (purple, brown, teal and orange), based on the following mapping:  - blue (1) becomes purple (6) - red (2) becomes brown (7) - green (3) becomes teal (8) - yellow (4) becomes orange (9)  Grey cells remain the same. The transformed cells are copied to correspond to their paired row in the output. There should be symmetry across the grey rows.\\\\n32. To make the output, you have to find the box (blue, red or green) in the input grid and colorize the section (from the beginning of the grid to the gray line) according to the following rules: - If only blue boxes are found, the color should be fuschia. - If only red boxes are found, the color should be orange. - If only green boxes are found, the color should be teal. - If blue and red boxes are found, the color should be teal. - If blue and green boxes are found, the color should be brown. - If red and green boxes are found, the color should be fuschia. - If blue, red and green boxes are found, the color should be orange.  Keep the gray lines the same as in the input grid. Your transformation should go around the grey lines and coloring the areas depending on the color(s) found in the given section.\\\\n33. The output grid is transformed according to the color boxes found between grey boxes. The color boxes in the input influence the color in the output grid. The part before the first gray box becomes 5 (fuchsia) if the color is blue, 6 (orange) if the color is red, 7 (teal) if the color is green and 8 (brown) if the color is yellow. The part between the two gray boxes is 6 (orange) if the color is blue, 7 (teal) if the color is red, 8 (brown) if the color is green and 9 (black) if the color is yellow. The part after the second gray box is 7 (teal) if the color is blue, 8 (brown) if the color is red, 9 (black\\\\n34. To make the output, you have to replace the number 0s in the first and third rows of each section (both in the body and outer bookends of the middle row) with the number 6, 7, 8 and 9 depending on the middle box of the middle row being 1, 2, 3, or 4 respectively. The middle box is then replaced with the next big number in the sequence. The transformation process does not affect the separators (rows of number 5 boxes).\\\\n35. To make the output, you first have to determine which color appears the most next to the grey bar. Assume that blue cells have a value of one, red cells have a value of two, etc. up until fuchsia cells, which have a value of four. If the value of the most appearing cell is X, you need to replace all the black cells of the row with the cell that has a value of X+5. If there is not any coloured cell in the row, replace the black cells with teal cells. The grey cells remain the same.\\\\n36. To make the output, the grey line remains the same while the rest of the squares is filled by different colors depending on the colors of the dots. Spaces to the left of the grey line are filled with a color code of the color dot present before the grey line plus 5 (e.g., if the colored dot is blue (code 1), then the left space will be filled with fuchsia (code 6)). Spaces to the right of the grey line are filled with a color code of the color dot present after the grey line plus 5 (e.g., if the colored dot is red (code 2), then the right space will be filled with teal (code 7)).\\\\n37. To create the output grid from the input grid, all black cells inside the boxes need to be changed to the exactly same color that is found at the center of that box. All 5\\\\\\'s (grey) and zero\\\\\\'s (black) outside the boxes stay as they are. Between boxes only horizontal grey lines exist.\\\\n38. The transformation maps each colour to another colour. The blue is mapped to teal, the red is mapped to orange, the green is mapped to yellow, and the yellow is mapped to fuschia. The grey blocks remain grey. The mapping is independent of the arrangement of the colours.\\\\n39. For a given input, replace the colored numbers (1,2,3,4) by adding each number by 5 (6,7,8,9) and then duplicating the lines with these new colors (6,7,8,9). The grey lines in the grid remain unchanged. The black cells are replaced by fuchsia color represented by number 6.\\\\n40. To make the output, the cells are replaced based on their color in the input. The transformation rule is as follows:  - Blue cells (1) are replaced with light grey (6). - Red cells (2) are replaced with fuschia (7). - Green cells (3) are replaced with orange (8). - Yellow cells (4) are replaced with teal (9). - Grey cells (5) remain the same.  This colour replacing rule applies to each section of the grid, from left to right. After the transformation, all cells within each section should be of the same color.\\\\n41. To produce the output,you must fill the whole row column-wise. This goes as follows: if cells contain a blue number, change it to fuschia; if they contain red,  change it to orange; if they contain green, change it to teal; if they contain yellow, change it to brown. Keep the grey cells as they are.\\\\n42. To make the output, you have to fill up the sectors defined by the grey lines. According to the color of the square in each sector, fill the entire sector with the corresponding color in the following rule: if the square is blue, fill with fuschia; if red, fill with orange; if green, fill with teal; if yellow, fill with brown. If a sector is empty, fill it with fuschia before a grey line and with orange after. Summarily, the transformation goes from blue->fuschia, red->orange, green->teal, yellow->brown, empty sector before grey line->fuschia, empty sector after grey line->orange.\\\\n43. Colors on the input are bounded by strips of grey. The colors are either absent (replaced by black squares), or are represented by one of the four other colors: blue, red, green, or yellow.   The transformation requires changing the color strips based on the colors in the center of the strip - the color in the middle row of the strip. Gray becomes fuschia. Blue, red, green, yellow together with the black where they are absent, are replaced by yellow, fuchsia, teal, orange, and brown, respectively, with the addition of two to their value. If there\\\\\\'s a grey line across the grid, it stays the same in the output.  Simply put, the entire transformation follows this color mapping: 0:6 (black to fuschia), 1:6 (blue to fuschia), 2:7 (red to orange), 3:8 (green to teal), 4:9 (yellow to brown), 5:5 (grey remains grey). The color changes are applied between\\\\n44. To make the output, you have to replace all the black cells on both sides of the grey cells with the colored cells. This color coding is given as follows: blue is replaced by fuschia. The red cells are replaced by orange. The green cells are replaced by teal, and yellow cells are replaced by brown. The grey cells remain unaltered. This replacement takes places in both directions, i.e., before and after the grey cells.\\\\n45. For transforming the grid, observe the colored digits present in each row above and below the gray section. For every blue digit, the cells between the gray sections transform to \\\\\\'fuschia\\\\\\', for every red digit the cells transform to \\\\\\'orange\\\\\\', for every green digit the cells transform to \\\\\\'yellow\\\\\\', and for every yellow digit the cells transform to \\\\\\'brown\\\\\\'. These transformed colors fill up the entire space between the gray sections. If there is a gray section in the middle of the grid, those remain unchanged. The transformation occurs on the complete row basis.\\\\n46. To transform the grid, each horizontal band of cells needs to be filled with fuschia, orange or teal depending on the color of the scattered cells present in that band:   If the scattered color is blue, fill the band with fuschia.  If the scattered color is red, fill the band with orange.  If the scattered color is green, fill the band with teal.  If the scattered color is yellow, fill the band with brown circles.  If the band contains scattered grey colors,no transformation is done.  The grey lines separating the bands should remain unchanged in the transformation.\\\\n47. To make the output, you need to color the cells based on the color cell found in each section. Each section can contain numbers from 1-4 corresponding to blue, red, green, and yellow respectively. Each of these colors is represented by a different color in the output: blue is represented as fuschia (6), red as orange (7), green as teal (8) and yellow as brown (9). Color all cells in a section, except for the grey cells, with the corresponding color from our mapping.\\\\n48. To make the output, you have to replace the black cells on both sides of the fuschia color cells, with fuschia color increasing by one for each color appearing from left to right. Keep replacing the colors until you encounter the next fuschia row. Therefore, if you start with fuschia (5), you should change the blue colors before the next row to orange (6), the red colors to teal (7), and if you encounter green colors, you should change them to brown (8), and so on. The principle is to replace the black cells based on the sequence of colors you see in the row.\\\\n49. The numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 in the input grid are replaced by the colors grey, green, teal, and brown respectively. The segments of black cells in the input are transformed into a segment of fuchsia cells in the first part, and a segment of teal cells in the second part. The cells with the number 5 acting as separators are maintained.\\\\n50. The output transformation takes the colored cells from the input and determines how many columns away they are from a grey line. This number is then added to the blue cell\\\\\\'s value (1) to form a new colored cell value. This new color fills the cells on both sides of the grey line, up to it, for a given set of rows. The grey cells stay the same.\\\\n51. To make the output, you have to replace the black cells with numbers according to the color cell in the next stripe to the right. Black cells before blue cells become number six (\\\\\\'6\\\\\\'). Black cells before red cells become number seven (\\\\\\'7\\\\\\'). Black cells before green cell become number eight (\\\\\\'8\\\\\\'). Black cells before yellow cells become number nine (\\\\\\'9\\\\\\'). The grey number five (\\\\\\'5\\\\\\'), blue, red, green and yellow cells remain the same.\\\\n52. To make the output, look at the colored square in each section. In ascending order from left to right, replace all black squares in the section with a colored square depending on the initial color:  - If the initial color is blue, replace black squares with a fuschia square.  - If it is red, replace black squares with a orange square.  - If it is green, replace black squares with a teal square.  - If it is yellow, replace black squares with a brown square.   Keep the grey dividing line unchanged in the output.\\\\n53. Increase the value of each colored square by 5 (e.g. blue square from 1 to 6), the grey squares (5s) remain the same. Fill the rest of the grid with squares of this color, keeping the grey lines the same. Repeat this operation for the part of the grid below each grey line, increasing the value of the color for each different line. If there are no colored squares on one side of a grey line, it copies the squares from the other side.\\\\n54. The transformation rule is to replace colours of the squares with new ones in the order of blue, red, green and yellow to fuschia, orange, teal and brown, respectively. But if the rows are separated by full lines of grey squares, it suggests a change in the replacement order.  After the grey line, the order changes to red, green, yellow, blue replaced by orange, teal, brown and fuschia.   The grey squares remain the same during transformation. Black squares are not a factor in the colour replacement, but are instead replaced by colour fuschia which follows the replaced colour in the order. If there is a grey square in the middle, all black squares on both sides will be replaced by the colour after the replacement corresponding to the colour in the previous middle box, in the order given.\\\\n55. To make the output, along each line of colored boxes, replace blue with fuschia (6), red with orange (7), green with teal (8), and yellow with brown (9). Replace the black boxes with the color of the box in their line. For any line containing solely grey boxes, leave it unchanged.\\\\n56. To make the output, you have to look at the numbers in the input grid excluding the yellow strip and transform them as follows: 1 to 6, 2 to 7, 3 to 8, and 4 to 9. Then you have to repeat this pattern on both sides of the yellow strip. If an input square is yellow, it stays yellow in the output. The black areas around the transformed colored squares in the output become filled with the color resulting from the transformation of the two adjoining colored squares in the input.\\\\n57. To make the output, you have to add 5 to the numbers that are not grey (5) replacing 0 with 6. This increases the original numbers proportionally, i.e., 1 becomes 6, 2 becomes 7, 3 becomes 8, and 4 becomes 9. The grey squares stay the same.\\\\n58. To make the output, each blue box is replaced by a fuschia box (6), each red box by a orange box (7), each green by a teal box (8) and each yellow by a brown box (9). The grey strip if present, stays as it is in the original grid. Each box\\\\\\'s color is replaced irrespective of its position in the grid.\\\\n59. For each colored number in the input grid, you need to transform all the zeros from the first position up to the first five of that row to the color number increased by 5. This should also be done for the zeros from the position of the first 5 plus 1 to the position of the second 5 and from the position of the second 5 plus one to the end of the row for the colored number in the 10th position. All the intermediate fives from the original grid should remain the same. The row made up of only 5s remains unchanged.\\\\n60. To make the output, you have to color the squares on either side of the grey line based on the color of the colored squares on that side in the input. If there are blue squares, color the squares fuschia. If there are red squares, color the squares orange. If there are green squares, color the squares teal. If there are yellow squares, color the squares brown. Lastly, keep the grey line as is.\\\\n61. To make the output, you have to fill the spaces around the blue, red, and green cells with colors according to the following mappings: blue --> fuchsia, red --> orange, black --> teal, green --> yellow, and gray cells remain the same. After gray cells filled between these colors on each side of the shapes, colors should repeat.\\\\n62. In each row with the series of 5\\\\\\'s, the values on either side are transformed based on the original color marked in each segment. Blue container (number 1) transforms to Fuschia (number 6). Red container (number 2) transforms to Orange (number 7). Green container (number 3) transforms to Teal (number 8). Yellow container (number 4) transforms to Brown (number 9).\\\\n63. The transformation follows a color value increase process for each unique non-zero value in the columns flanking the grey line. This is to be applied on a row by row basis from top to bottom: 1. All black (0) cells are converted to fuschia (6). 2. The blue cells (1) are converted to red (2) in the first section, green (3) in the second section and yellow (4) in the third section, etc. each followed by a color increase by 1 sequential unit. 3. The red cells (2) are likewise converted to green (3) in the first section, yellow (4) in the second section, and then to grey (5) in the third section, and so on for subsequent sections. The grey line remains unaltered.\\\\n64. To make the output, we first identify the color of the section by calculating the maximum color value in that section. We then modify the colors in the sections as per the following mapping: if blue (1), the section becomes fuchsia (6); if red (2), it becomes teal(7); if green (3), it becomes orange (8); if no colour (0), the section remains bore color (black). The grey lines remain the same.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 826}\")": "Category 1: Transformation based on the color of the middle cell\nRule: For each section, the transformation depends on the color of the middle cell.

For each category, synthesize the rules into a single, specific rule that combines the ideas of all rules in that category, while clearly differentiating it from the other categories.\\\\nThe new rule should be as specific as possible, following the format of the given rules.\\\\nThe new rule should be applicable without any information from the original rules - i.e. it should be standalone.\\\\n\\\\nRules:\\\\n1. To make the output, you have to shift each colored section up by one place, i.e., the blue section moves to the place initially occupied by the yellow section, the red section moves to where the blue section was, and the yellow section moves to where the red section was originally. The colors on the black background remain the same otherwise.\\\\n2. To transform the input grid into the output grid, follow these steps:  1. For the colored squares in the input, move them upward exactly half the height of the grid, keeping their relative positions within the grid constant.  2. The rest of the colored squares should be black.\\\\n3. Identify the non-black cell groups in the input; these will be in a 4x4 square at varying positions in the input grid. In the output, shift each of these groups up by seven cells. If this causes a group to shift off the grid, place it at the bottom in the same horizontal position. Black cells have no effect and remain unchanged. The rest of the grid is filled with black cells.\\\\n4. To transform the grid, the top rectangle remains the same. The middle rectangle moves up into the place of the topmost rectangle, while keeping its original color, effectively replacing the top rectangle. The bottom one replaces the middle one with its own color. Now you should leave the old position of the bottom rectangle black. Repeat the process each time the transformation is applied.\\\\n5. To form the output, the transformation takes place in two steps:  1. The three color patterns are adjusted to be in the same order as the input, but with blue kept in the top middle. So, the sequence of patterns regardless of their color, from top to bottom after adjustment is: color box 1 in the input, blue box in the input, color box 2 in the input.  2. The middle row containing the blue boxes in the adjusted input is then duplicated and added to the very middle row of the grid leaving the rest of the grid black.  This transformation essentially shifts the blue color pattern to the top half of the grid and duplicates it to split the grid into half while maintaining the order of the other two color patterns as per the input.\\\\n6. To create the output, you need to shift each colored rectangle up by 1 unit. In essence, imagine the non-zero elements of the grid as objects affected by gravity and are falling towards the bottom of the grid.\\\\n7. To make the output, you have to shift the entire colored crops up by one row, and the rows that gets isolated during this shift should be moved to the bottom, making it appear as if the rows were being scrolled upwards.\\\\n8. To make the output, you have to move each color block upwards until they hit the top edge of the grid, keeping all of their squares in the same positions relative to each other. All squares not part of a block should remain black.\\\\n9. To make the output, you have to shift the lines from their original position to the center of the grid. The blue line remains vertical, but moves horizontally to the middle of the grid. The horizontal red line moves up to center vertically in the grid but stays on the left edge, and the yellow line stays on the right edge but moves up to become horizontal and is centered vertically. Everything else remains black.\\\\n10. To transform the input into the output, shift each colored figure up by one row. The blue squares move to the position originally occupied by the red rectangles, the yellow rectangles take the place of the blue squares, and the red rectangles come to the very bottom. In the process, the top row becomes entirely black.\\\\n11. To make the output, you have to keep the blue and orange cells in their original positions but move the red cells from the bottom to in between the orange and blue cells. Additionally, black cells occupy the previous position of the red cells. This effectively makes the red rectangle slide up to the middle of the grid.\\\\n12. To make the output, you have to drop each of the colored blocks until they rest at the lowest point. This means replacing the cells under the colored block with the block itself and replacing the original position of the block with black cells. If two blocks occupy the same vertical column, only the bottom-most block will drop to the lowest point while the other falls atop the lower block, maintaining their relative height difference as seen in the input.\\\\n13. To make the output, you have to move the blue and red blocks upwards by three steps while the yellow block stays at the same level. Once moved, clear the spaces where the blue and red blocks were initially positioned. The rest of the grid remains unchanged.\\\\n14. The transformation includes moving each color as a whole along the horizontal middle line of the grid to its other side while keeping the colors in their original order. Then, delete the original colored regions, replacing them with the black color, making it appear as if the colored squares have been flipped about the middle row.\\\\n15. To make the output, you have to  visually shift up each of the colored shapes while keeping their original width and height until reaching to a same horizon line. The colored shapes do not overlap each other.\\\\n16. The transformation of this grid involves vertical rotation. You have to rotate the colored stripe from bottom to top. The only thing to keep in mind is that the yellow line is always located in the middle of the grid, dividing the blue and red lines. The blue and red lines always switch their places with respect to the starting position.\\\\n17. To make the output, you have to move each colored rectangle up by 4 squares (rows). If the rectangle hits the top border of the grid after being moved, then its bottom part will disappear, anything that goes beyond the top border is not displayed in the output. The cells that are left empty after the move are then filled with black cells (0).\\\\n18. To make the output, you need to consider only the area covered by the colored blocks on the input. You have to perform the following steps: 1. Shift the colored blocks towards the center such that each block is just one cell away from the center. 2. Drop the topmost block to the bottom. As a result, the bottommost block in the input becomes the topmost block in the output. 3. Retain all other blocks at their current vertical positions.\\\\n19. To produce the output from the input, the operation performed is shifting. Each colored rectangle is shifted up until it hits a non-black cell. The blue rectangles move up to the top of the grid, since there is no non-black cell above them. The red rectangle stops when it hits the first blue rectangle, and the yellow rectangle stops when it hits the red rectangle. Black cells fill the empty space left by the shifted rectangles.\\\\n20. To create the output, you have to scroll each color block up by one space, ensuring the color blocks occupy the spaces previously held by the black cells directly above them. The black spaces left behind the colors on the lowest rows will be replaced by black cells (value 0). All other cells remain unchanged.\\\\n21. To make the output from the input, each of the coloured clusters should be moved up four rows, leaving black (empty) squares in their previous location. This creates the illusion that all coloured squares have risen. If there is any coloured cluster, move it four rows above its initial position.\\\\n22. The transformation involves moving the colored shapes within the grid. Each colored shape retains its form and moves in the same direction: the blue squares move up 5 cells, the yellow squares move down 4 cells, and the red square does not move. Any colored shape that hits the boundary of the grid is cut off at the boundary, not wrapped around. The remaining black cells are unmodified.\\\\n23. The transformation consists of moving the colored rectangles towards the center of the grid. The blue rectangle moves downwards, the red rectangle moves upwards, and the purple rectangle moves upwards. In other words, Annihilate four black rows between the colored rectangles. The rectangles preserve their size and color during the moving process.\\\\n24. To make the output, you have to mirror the input horizontally, while maintaining the color of the shapes. Each horizontal row is mirrored on the center of the grid. The shapes present only appear in the lower half of the grid, so the shapes get moved to the top and vice versa.\\\\n25. To make the output, you have to move the colored lines up by one level. The blue lines stay in place, the red lines move up one level, and the yellow lines move up two levels. The green lines also move up by one level. Everything else stays black.\\\\n26. To make the output, you have to rotate the three color sections 90 degrees counterclockwise without changing their relative positions. Red section will move to the bottom, blue to the left and yellow to the top. The remaining parts will be filled with the black color.\\\\n27. To make the output, you have to shift the colored squares to the center of the grid. The squares retain their position relative to each other, but they should all be moved up such that the top row of the top square is positioned on the row of the input where the top square used to start.\\\\n28. To make the output, you have to take the block of blue squares from the bottom-left and move it up 3 spaces. The red and yellow squares should be moved up 2 spaces each. The single blue square between the blue and red squares should be moved up by one space. All other squares should remain in the same place.\\\\n29. To make the output, move the row of blue squares up until they touch either a non-black square or the top of the grid. Repeat with the red squares falling until they touch a non-black square or the bottom of the grid. Repeat with the yellow squares going downwards in the same manner. Black squares do not move. In each case where one square color touches another, the square color being moved \"bounces\" back and retains its original row.\\\\n30. In order to get the output grid, every colored box from the input grid moves upwards by five cells. The transformation doesn\\\\\\'t affect the color or the size of the boxes, just their position.\\\\n31. Each colored rectangle must be shifted upwards by 4 cells. The space that was formerly occupied by the rectangles becomes black. The resulting figures maintain their original colors: blue, red, and yellow.\\\\n32. To make the output, you will first identify the three rectangles in the input grid. These rectangles will be placed in a different order in the output. The blue rectangle stays at the same position, the red rectangle moves to the blue rectangle\\\\\\'s initial position, yellow rectangle stays in it\\\\\\'s place and green rectangle moves to the red rectangle\\\\\\'s initial place. Any space between and around the rectangles is kept black. The remaining space above and below the rows is kept black.\\\\n33. To make the output, you need to shift each colored shape up the grid by one place. The top shape moves off the top of the grid and doesn\\\\\\'t appear in the output. The other shapes move up one place so the red shape will now be at the top and the yellow one in the middle. The space where the bottom shape used to be is filled with black.\\\\n34. To make the output, you have to move the block of colored squares up by four cells. The lowermost colored squares become black, while the cells that the colored squares surpass during their ascent become a copy of the original block.\\\\n35. To make the output, you have to rotate the colored blocks of cells by 90 degrees anti-clockwise about the middle of the grid, keeping the other cells as they are.\\\\n36. To make the output, you have to shift the coloured rectangular shapes upwards by one row. This shift happens in the following order: blue rectangle moves first, then red, and finally green. The cells below the moved shapes become black, while the rest of the grid remains the same.\\\\n37. To make the output, the colored lines of boxes are shifted upwards in the grid. The blue boxes remain at the same horizontal level, the green boxes are shifted up by two spaces and the red boxes by four spaces. All the remaining space in the grid is filled with black.\\\\n38. To make the output, you have to conduct two transformations. First, you move the red strip upwards by two spaces. Then, move the the yellow strip upwards by four spaces. The color strips maintain their width, and empty spaces are filled with black.\\\\n39. To make the output, you have to move each color block down by one block in the grid. The block at the bottom is moved to the top. And all the other blocks are located under the one that they were initially on top of.\\\\n40. To make the output, you have to \\\\\\'slide\\\\\\' the coloured sections upwards, until they hit the top of the grid or another coloured section. The blue section slides up until it hits the top of the grid. Similarly, the red section also slides up, but stops when it hits the blue section. The yellow section also slides up until it hits the red section.   This is equivalent to \\\\\\'floating\\\\\\' the colored sections up to the \\\\\\'surface\\\\\\' of the black grid, where they come to rest either at the top, or on top of another colored section.\\\\n41. To make the output, you have to rotate the colored lines 90 degrees anticlockwise. The lines remain in the same horizontal position but their colors and lengths will now run down vertically instead of horizontally.\\\\n42. To generate the output grid from the input grid, the pattern in the input grid is moved up by 1 row. Then, specifically for the blue areas, they are replaced by an equal number of red areas, and similarly, the red areas are replaced by an equal number of yellow areas, and the yellow areas are replaced by an equal number of blue areas. All the other black spaces remain unchanged. Subsequently, the output grid sequence features a movement of pattern in an upward direction and color transformation.\\\\n43. To make the output, look for the colored squares at the bottom of the grid. Move each of the colored lines upwards by 4 rows and the leftmost colored line to the bottom. The rest of the cells should remain black. The transformation involves repositioning of the color lines while maintaining the rest as black cells.\\\\n44. To transform the grid, move the each color object up to the highest row possible within the grid, maintaining their column positions. The remaining squares should be black.\\\\n45. To make the output, you have to translate the blue line of cells up to the first line on the grid where a color cell exists, translate the green line of cells down to the line on the grid where yellow cells exist, translate the yellow line of cells up to where the green line was and, finally, translate the red line of cells up to where blue line was.\\\\n46. To transform the input into output, visualize flipping it around the horizontal axis in the middle. The colored sections appear at the same position from the center, but above it instead of below. Furthermore, all non-colored blocks (those that are not blue, red or yellow) should be made black.\\\\n47. To make the output, you need to move the colored blocks towards the middle while preserving their order from right to left. the colored blocks needs to be moved up by two cells at a time from the bottom until no block reaches the bottom row. The blue block, if present, will always be the first to move up even if it\\\\\\'s not at the bottom. After the blue block has moved up, the red block is the next to move, and finally the yellow block. Note that the yellow blocks only move up if the blue and red blocks have already moved up or are not present.\\\\n48. To make the output, you have to shift each colored strip upward by one row. If the top row of a colored strip is reaching the upper edge of the grid, delete it. If a color strip disappears completely after shifting, do not replace it with a new strip at the bottom.\\\\n49. To make the output, you need to swap the first two colored rectangles from the bottom. You leave the bottom most rectangle in place and swap the placement of the next two rectangles above it. This results in the sequence of colors from top to bottom becoming: yellow, blue, red.\\\\n50. To make the output, you have to shift the color strips upwards by one row while maintaining the same width and length, replacing the bottom row of each strip with black. Do not shift the topmost strip. Afterward, erase the contents of the new last-colored-row (what used to be the second-colored-row before the shift) leaving only black.\\\\n51. The operation performed on the grid seems be an upwards shifting of colored layers. Each colored layer appears to move upward to replace the black layer directly above it. Once a colored layer hits the top, it disappears and turns into black. The lowest layer of the colored bands appears to remain stationary.\\\\n52. To make the output, you have to shift the smaller squares upwards, keeping them in the same order. When a smaller square reaches the top of the larger square (row 7 of the grid), it should stay there for the subsequent turn, and then disappear (turn into black cells) in the turn after that. The square that originally was at the bottom will move up after the upper two squares have disappeared.\\\\n53. To make the output, you have to shift the colored squares upward. Each colored square (red, blue, yellow) should be moved up such that the top side of each square aligns with the top side of the black box previously above it. If there is no black box above the colored square, consider the top of the grid as the reference. After the shift, the squares\\\\\\' positions become either the topmost row or the row 1 row below the existing squares.\\\\n54. To make the output, you have to move the blue square 5 lines up, the red square 6 lines up and the yellow square 7 lines up. The spaces previously occupied by the squares become black.\\\\n55. To make the output, you have to move the colored squares upward. Move the red squares located at the lower left corner to upper left corner, blue squares from lower middle rows to middle rows and yellow squares from right middle rows to upper right corner. The rest of the squares in the grid will stay black.\\\\n56. To make the output, you have to push all the colored lines to the border nearest to them and remove the lines in the middle. Bluish lines should go up to the top border, yellowish lines go to the right border, reddish lines go down to the bottom border and greenish lines go to the left border.\\\\n57. To make the output, you have to move the different colored shapes down by one row, starting with the yellow shape, then the blue shape, followed by the red shape.\\\\n58. To make the output, you have to shift the colored blocks up by a few rows. The number of rows to move up for each block is determined by their numerical color value. For example, blue block (1) moves up by 1 row, red block (2) moves up by 2 rows, and yellow blocks (4) move up by 4 rows. Once a block encounters another block during the shift, it stops moving up. Note that movement only occurs in the upwards direction; no horizontal or diagonal movement is involved in this transformation.\\\\n59. To make the output, you have to first remove the upper areas of 3 colored rectangles so that they all look like 3 small squares aligned at the bottom. Then you move the red square up to the center of grid.\\\\n60. To make the output, you have to shift the small colored squares upwards and remove the bottommost row of squares. Each small square (colored blue, red, or yellow) is shifted upwards by the same amount as the horizontal distance between itself and the left border of the grid. The bottommost row of squares is removed entirely.\\\\n61. To make the output, you have to shift each colored stripe upwards by one row. The topmost coloured stripe wraps around to the bottom of the grid. All other cells remain black.\\\\n62. To make the output, you have to  swap the positions of the two blocks. The block that was in the top will now be at the bottom aside, and the block that was at the bottom will now be at the top. The empty blocks between and surrounding each of the two blocks should remain the same. {\\\\n63. To transform the grid, note that the colored shapes on the input grid are divided into four categories. The transformation pattern involves mirroring the shapes along the middle row of the matrix, replacing the original colored shapes with their mirrored versions. The order of the mirrored shapes from top to bottom remains the same as the order of the original shapes from top to bottom.  For example, in case 0, the first shape is a blue line, which is mirrored along the middle row of the matrix to replace the green line at the bottom. Then the red line is mirrored and placed in the former blue line position, so on and so forth. The transformation completes when the colored shapes have each been replaced with their mirrored version and the unoccupied part of the matrix remains black.\\\\n64. To make the output, you must first look for the yellow, blue and red rectangles in the input. Then, move each rectangle like the whole grid is rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise. Thus, the red rectangle remains at the bottom of the output, the blue rectangle is moved to the middle and the yellow rectangle is moved to the top. The black background cells fill in the remaining blocks of the grid.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "Category 1: Shifting colored sections upwards by a specific amount\n1.

To make the output, you have to look for the colored patterns in the input grid. These colored patterns are located around the center of the grid and consist of two lines of squares with the same color. You need to copy the pattern and extend it to both sides horizontally until it touches either side of the grid or another square. If there is a square of another color already placed where you would like to extend the pattern to, do not overwrite that square with the extended pattern.\\\\n2. To make the output, you have to extend each colored shape by one cell to the left and right. If a colored shape is not touching the top or bottom of the grid, you should also extend it downwards as well as upwards.\\\\n3. To make the output, you have to reflect the upper symbol in relation to the axis passing through the middle of the symbol\u2019s two cells, creating a sequence of symbols in the black cells. It would look like the symbol is dragged down. Similarly, the lower symbol is reflected up. The filled cells from the original input remain unchanged.\\\\n4. To make the output, you have to expand the patterns in each direction toward the middle of the grid, wherever there\\\\\\'s empty space. This should be done symmetrically until the expanded parts meet in the middle.\\\\n5. To make the output, you have to take the colored formations from the input and transform them. Around each colored formation, you will draw a square (or rectangle) using the same color as the smallest cell within that formation. The square/rectangle will be drawn from the first cell of the formation in the top left corner to the last cell of the formation in the bottom right corner. Note that the shape\\\\\\'s area (formed by colored cells) is not only filled but extended outside until it makes the rectangle/perimeter respecting the black cells borders. The non black color used for this task will be the one common of all lines. If there are cells of other colors on top or at the bottom of the colored formation, they are enclosed within the square/rectangle as well. The rest of the grid remains black.\\\\n6. To make the output, you have to expand each shape into their eight neighbors in all orthogonally and diagonally skew directions. It is like an explosion that happens once and propagates to the immediate surroundings. Although the black cells are expanded this never overlaps with the explosion of colored shapes. If a shape is close to the border and there is no space to complete the expansion, it should just expand as much as space allows it to.\\\\n7. The pattern in transforming the grid is based on square formation of pixels. The four pixels of color \\\\\\'x\\\\\\' forming a square are transformed to form another square of color \\\\\\'x\\\\\\'. The additional pixels of color \\\\\\'x\\\\\\' will place on top the current square formation. The center of the new square formation is the same as the center of the original 4-pixel-square. For those color pixels which doesn\\\\\\'t form a square are left as it is.\\\\n8. To generate the output grid from the input, copy all cells on the left of the center (excluding the center line if the total columns of the grid are even) to the right side such that the original leftmost column overlays on the original rightmost column, the second leftmost column overlays on the second rightmost, and so on. The overlaid cells then replace the original cells on the right. If two different colored cells overlay each other, then keep the smaller numbered color.\\\\n9. To make the output, you have to horizontally expand the coloured squares in the middle of the grid only. The other coloured squares remain unchanged. After expanding, the squares should replace the surrounding black cells. The size of the squares remains the same with the colours of the original grid squares.\\\\n10. To make the output, replace the larger shape in the input grid with an altered version of the smaller shape. This smaller shape is then scaled up to double its original size, while the original design elements inside the shape remain the same size and are centered in the quadrants of the shape. The original large shape is now replaced and depicted in a smaller size centered in the new larger shape.\\\\n11. To make the output, you have to follow a specific sequence: 1. Find the block with two rows of colored squares at the top of the grid. Perform a vertical mirror flip to this block but maintain its position. 2. Find the block with three rows of colored squares in the middle of the grid. Retain the middle row of this block and move it one step up and down to create an expanded block with five rows in total. Keep the middle row unchanged. 3. Find the block with two rows of colored squares at the bottom of the grid. Repeat the same process that you used for the top block by flipping it vertically and retaining its position.\\\\n12. To make the output, you have to expand any coloured block horizontally. For a coloured block, identify its height (the difference between the highest and lowest vertical position it occupies). Then, extend this block by the same number of cells to the left and right. If there is a single coloured dot, it expands to form a line of that color and all cells two spaces away to the left and right acquire the same color as well. But if there is no colour on a row or if there is another colour block on that row, do not expand or extend it.\\\\n13. To make the output, do the following: Cylindrically reflect each distinct shape across the center of the whole grid: i.e. the top shape is reflected to the bottom and vice-versa; on the left to the right and vice-versa and at the intersection of the four quadrants, where the four shapes from the previous steps meet, change the colors to the corresponding ones from the input grid.\\\\n14. To make the output, you have to find the colored cells in the center of the grid, notice its height (the number of cells from top to bottom) and width (the number of cells from left to right). Then reflect this shape to the left side.   However, for the reflected shape on the left side, you do not copy its colors, but instead use a specific color according to the following rules:  - If the original shape uses blue, use red. - If the original shape uses green, use teal. - If the original shape uses orange, use grey. - If the original shape uses purple, use yellow.   After this reflection, if the original shape\\\\\\'s height is even, reflect the whole thing (including the new left-side shape) downwards but keeping the colors the same. If the original shape\\\\\\'s height is odd, do not do this additional reflection. The cells that were not affected remain the same.\\\\n15. To make the output, identify two kinds of colored squares in the input: a short square (one that is only two cells tall), and a long square (one that is three cells tall). In the input, the short square is located above or below a longer square of another color.   For all the long squares, extend them by one cell on the side where the short square is located. Do this by looking at the side of the square where the short one is located and coloring in the cell that is immediately adjacent to its outer edge.   For all the short squares, extend them two cells towards both left and right side. Fill the cells with the color of the short square.   Black cells in the grid remain untouched.\\\\n16. To make the output, you have to identify the two singular colored pixels that are the same color and are lying alone or surrounded by other colored pixels in the input. After recognizing them, you have to draw a colored rectangle around the lowest of these two singular colored pixels in the output. This colored rectangle should be the same color as the identified colored pixel and should have the same height and width as the distance between the two identified colored pixels in the input.   Notice that the rectangle should be filled out completely with the identified color and be continuous with no breaks in it. For cases where the two identified colored pixels are at the same vertical position, simply draw a vertical line of identified color at the corresponding position in the output. Moreover, it is important to note that other configurations in the input (whatever they may be) are completely ignore and does not transfer over to the output.\\\\n17. The transformation pattern involves expanding the color blocks horizontally in both directions by duplicating the color for 2 additional cells. This inflation only occurs if the color block size is more than 1 cell. If the block is a single cell, no expansion occurs. The transformation tends to resemble horizontal line duplication for color blocks more than 1 cell in height.\\\\n18. To make the output, you have to draw identical colored shapes at each side of the initial point (the middle). The shapes on north or south gets duplicated below or above respectively, and if the shape was on the east or west, gets duplicated to the west or east. In other words, the grid seems to reflect the shapes over an \"invisible line\" to get to the output grid.\\\\n19. To make the output, you have to take a look at the blue color of each group and extend them (painted with the extend color) within the boundary of the smaller group. The boundary is defined such that the two squares on two consecutive rows or two consecutive columns are the same colors.\\\\n20. To make the output, you have to reproduce each colored pattern three more times in its surrounding area. Simulate the spreading of the colored pattern in the adjacent rows above and below its initial position in a symmetrical way. Colored patterns should not overlap each other, and the black cells outside the patterns remain unchanged.\\\\n21. To make the output, you have to expand each colored shape by 2 cells in all cardinal directions (up, down, left, right) by filling the cells with the same colored pixels, except the black cells should stay black. If this expansion causes an overlap between two shapes, the lower positioned shape in the input grid should take priority and replace the pixels of the higher positioned shape.\\\\n22. To make the output, you have to figure out the shape of the colored tiles. The rule is to consider the colored shapes as an open bottom container and fill in the empty spaces below the shapes by the same color till its bottom is closed by the same color or reaches the end of the grid. The filled color is based on the color found in the column where the filling takes place.\\\\n23. To make the output, you have to pick each colored shape in the input grid, then create a larger square around it by duplicating the colored pixels from the periphery of the shape. The boundary of this new square is 2 pixels away from the shape\u2019s boundary. The duplicate pixels are placed in the same order as they appear on the shape\\\\\\'s boundary, filling the periphery of the new square. After this step, each small shape should be enclosed in a larger square of the same color.\\\\n24. To make the output, you have to expand the colored objects by 1 square around their original position, marking this expanded space with the color of the object. After expansion, the new space colored in yellow (4) overlaps with already colored spaces in red (2), keep the color red (2) in those squares. For other colors (3 in case 0, 2,3; 8 in case 1), color the three cells just below the colored cell if they are black. Ignore any isolated colored squares that do not form part of a larger colored object in the output.\\\\n25. To make the output, you have to duplicate the colored blocks in the upwards direction. The color blocks on the input grid that are 2 cells high grow to be 5 cells high in the output grid. Blocks that are 1 cell high remain as 1 cell in height.\\\\n26. To make the output, you have to replicate the blue, half-filled rectangle under the three-colored shape, then replace the upper half of the rectangle with the color of the middle part of the three-colored shape. The two rectangles should be the same size. Do not change any other parts of the grid.\\\\n27. To make the output, you have to extend the colored blocks vertically both downwards and upwards until they reach another colored block or the end of the grid. The colors of the blocks should remain unchanged during the expansion. Colors do not mix- a yellow block will stop expanding if it hits a red block, and vice versa.\\\\n28. To make the output, you have to horizontally expand any group of colored squares of the same color so that they form a straight horizontal line across the grid. Every group of colored squares must be expanded independently from each other. This transformation affects the entire row where the group is located, turning it into the same color as the expanded group. Rows where no vertical sections of colored squares occur remain with no change.\\\\n29. The transformation from the input to output grids reflects a series of shifts with respect to the two main shapes:  1. For the vertical shape on the top/left part of the grid:     The main shape/pattern will be enlarged on its right and downside by duplicating its original cells (colors).    The enlargement maintains the original shape\\\\\\'s line of symmetry (e.g., case 0, header line of \\\\\\'3\\\\\\'s is completed to the bottom). If part of the shape is not symmetrical the lines are not duplicated (e.g., case 1, \\\\\\'8\\\\\\'s in the middle are not duplicated).   2. For the horizontal shape on the bottom part of the grid:     The main pattern is duplicated one time to top. (e.g., case 0, bottom \\\\\\'4\\\\\\'s are duplicated to just above its original position)    The new duplicates are located directly above and in line with, their corresponding original elements.  Note: The duplication process does not affect any other color or pattern within the grid, black or colored. The \\\\\\'background\\\\\\' remains the same. The changes are\\\\n30. To make the output, take the color and shape of the blocks in the upper pair and expand this shape downwards to match the vertical size of the lower block pair, ensuring the expanded portion matches the color of that above. Do not change the original upper pair. Erase the original lower pair, replacing them with black. For any lower pair of blocks without a corresponding upper pair, leave unchanged as they don\\\\\\'t contribute to any transformation.\\\\n31. Here\\\\\\'s how the transformation goes. The transformation appears to expand the colored shape in the middle zone both upwards and downwards to fill the immediately next cell vacant in the upper and lower zone. This expansion only happens in the same horizontal column the colored shape is present in. If a colored shape already exists in the cell where the expansion would happen, the original color remains. The color of the block that expands is the color of the block present in the middle zone of the input grid. Other colors in the grid remain unchanged.\\\\n32. To make the output, you have to expand the colored shapes in the lower half of the grid upwards and downwards by two rows. The colors enclosed within the larger shapes are not affected by this expansion. The upper half of the grid is rotated around its center and is overlaid on the right half of the grid. This merged section can overlap with the lower half of the grid but no merging of colors occurs.\\\\n33. To make the output, you have to look at the colored squares from the input grid. If there are two squares of one color, copy the color on the row above and the row below the existing ones, leaving empty the column before and after the colored squares. Then, repeat the process with the other color. If there is one square of one color, copy the color in the same column but one row above. No other changes should be made.\\\\n34. To make the output, you have to duplicate the \"arrow\" pattern on both sides of the original. Keep the central part of the arrow in the original color, and fill out the duplicated parts in the color of the arrow\\\\\\'s \"wings\". Remove colors that are not part of the arrow pattern.\\\\n35. To make the output, you have to look for the horizontal lines of colored cells in the input. You have to take these lines and make them the center of a filled square of the same color in the output. The squares should extend above and below the original line (without changing its width), until its center is at the same level as the original line, and it should not \"overfloat\" the grid, its size should always be adapted to fit in the input grid\\\\\\'s size. But if the original line of color already has the maximum length upwards and downwards, leave it as it is. In case there\\\\\\'s more than one line of the same color, treat each one as separate cases. Rest of the cells should remain black.\\\\n36. To make the output, you have to extend the colored spikes through the black space by 4 cells in total length. Firstly extending upwards for spikes on the top half of the grid and downwards for spikes on the bottom half. Stop extending when another colored spike or the end of grid is encountered. If spikes encounter, color of the top spike is used.\\\\n37. To make the output, you have to replicate the exact pattern for the top shape which will remain unchanged. For the bottom shape, you can imagine flipping the whole shape upside down except for a horizontal middle line that will stay the same.\\\\n38. To make the output, you have to find the squares in the input and \"flood fill\" them to the left and right in the output. This is best explained with an example: - In Case 0, there are two squares in the input. One green square is at the top and one blue square at the bottom. In the output, the green square remains untouched, while the blue square is flood filled to the left and right. - In Case 1, there are two squares in the input. One grey square at the top and one red square at the bottom. In the output, the grey square remains untouched, while the red square is flood filled to the left. - In Case 2, there are also two squares. One blue square at the top and one green square at the bottom. In the output, both squares are expanded, but the blue square is expanded to the left and right and the green square is enlarged downwards and upwards. - In Case 3, there are three squares in the input. One green square at the top, a purple square in the middle and, a yellow square at the bottom. In the output,\\\\n39. To create the output, look for any pair of colored pixels on top and bottom half of the input grid that vertically align with each other and are the same color. Extend colored pixels of the same color upward and downward from each pair to create a vertical colored line that spans the height of the grid between the locations of the original pair. Finally, keep the other colored pixels that do not meet the above condition the same.\\\\n40. To make the output, you have to find the colored shapes and double their width and height by adding the same color cells to their sides. The cells should be added to the left side and the top side of the original structures.\\\\n41. The pattern is a vertical mirroring effect by which the colored shape in the upper half is duplicated and mirrored vertically in the middle of the grid. The same pattern applies for the lower half of the grid too, but the duplication and mirroring effect takes place in the opposite direction, from the lower part to the middle of the grid. The colors remain the same during this operation.\\\\n42. To make the output, you have to look for these small groups of coloured cells in the input. Each group, defined by common colour, should be surrounded by an extra layer of cells of the same colour in the output. Note that the additional layer should be on the sides and bottom, but not the top of each group. If a group is already adjacent to another group, the second group does not get another layer on that side. The rest of the cells keep their values as in the input.\\\\n43. To make the output, you have to perform an operation on each shape (series of same colored cells of the same type). The operation is to mirror the shape across its vertical centerline. Note that the centerline of each shape is not necessarily the same. If the shape contains an odd number of cells, the centerline is the column of cells located at the center of the shape. If the shape contains an even number of cells, the centerline is halfway between the two central columns. The shape is mirrored across the centerline by copying its left side to its right side and its right side to its left side. Finally, replace any red cell that is a part of the original shape with a black color.\\\\n44. To transform the input grid to the output grid, extend the pairs and triplets of colored cells horizontally to meet in the middle of the grid. If the colored cells are found in the upper part of the grid, fill the empty cells to their right. If the colored cells are found in the lower part of the grid, fill the empty cells to their left. The filled cells should take the same color as the original pair or triplet.\\\\n45. To make the output, you need to add horizontal symmetry on the midline of each symbol. This means all color cells that are above the midline of the symbol should be reflected below the midline and all color cells that below the midline should be reflected above the midline. You can imagine it as folding the symbol along the midline. Note that for symbols that take up only one row, no transformation is required and they remain the same in the output.\\\\n46. To make the output, you have to look for the presence of 2x2 blocks of color (except black). If found, mirror the pattern at the top (or bottom, if no space at the top) of the grid to form a larger pattern of the same color forming a 3x4 rectangle where middle 2x2 block is original color pattern. If multiple 2x2 color blocks are present, this needs to be done for each one. If any colored single square is present without a 2x2 block, it is left as is.\\\\n47. To make the output, replicate the top colored line in the same position. Then, surround both sides of the middle colored line with the same color that appears on the top colored line. The bottom color line should be the same as the middle colored line in the input. The rest of the grid should remain black (empty).\\\\n48. To make the output, you need to identify the patterns and replicate them both vertically and horizontally around the initial configuration of the pattern. At some points, the patterns overlap each other - smaller pattern (2 cells wide or tall) is overlapped by the larger pattern (4 cells wide or tall). Two elements wide patterns remain the same, but four elements wide patterns get increased to be 8 cells wide. The increase is symmetric around the original cells.\\\\n49. To make the output, you have to expand each colored object in its row by doubling its size symmetrically. If the object has a single color, the expansion will use the same color. If the object has two colors, the expansion will still maintain the order and proportion of the colors. The expansion should not affect black parts in the row.\\\\n50. To make the output, first copy the input grid to the output. Then look at the small bottom sign. You need to draw a larger image of the small bottom sign under the middle sign with the top end touching the middle sign. Similarly, draw a larger image of the top sign on the top of the middle sign in the same way. Note that the output drawn sign should be 4 times the size of the input sign and should be centered in the grid as much as possible.\\\\n51. To make the output, you have to extend horizontally the vertical lines of colored pixels located in the bottom field. Every group of pixels should preserve its form and color, while being extended towards both left and right up to the groups of pixels beside it. If there is no other group beside it, the group of pixels should be extended up to the side of the grid. The top field and the rest of the grid unoccupied by the fields remain unchanged.\\\\n52. Each colored symbol in the input grid expands equally in the vertical direction. More specifically, for each color, besides the original shape, it also occupies every black cell that is vertically adjacent to the colored cells. The expansion does not overlap with the area occupied by the other color.\\\\n53. To produce the output grid, you need to take each colored blob/figure from the input and expand it outwards by one unit space in the cardinal directions (up, down, left, and right), while keeping its original color. This additional layer is added only if adjacently there is black (empty) space and not any other blob/figure. Seems like, the blobs or figures are inflated or expanded while respecting the boundaries of other figures.\\\\n54. To make the output, you have to transform each separate shape to look like it has been vertically mirrored and its \"reflection\" added right below where it originally stood in the input, doubling the height of the shape without widening it. The \"reflection\" below shares the same color as the original shape. None of the other colors are changed, and all cells around and between the shapes remain empty.\\\\n55. To make the output, you have to analyze the electrical schematic symbol in the input and make them complete if they are incomplete by extending them to both sides horizontally until they reach another symbol or the edge of the grid. If a full schematic symbol is already present in the grid and surrounded by empty grid cells, leave it as it is.  The symbol drawn with orange and blue color is a transistor, with the orange color indicating the direction of current in one direction and the blue indicating no current in the opposite direction. If the transistor is incomplete, complete it.  The symbol drawn with green color represents switch symbol, complete it if it is incomplete.  The electrical symbol of the purple color represents the bulb or lamp. If the lamp is incomplete, complete it.  The symbol drawn with red color and a blue line crossing it represents the LED. The red part represents the anode and the blue part represents the cathode. If they are incomplete, complete them.\\\\n56. The transformation starts by looking at each color set individually in the grid. For each individual color set, look at the colored shape. If it is alone, do nothing. But if it has more than one element together in a 2x2 square, extend this colored shape 1 cell in each direction but only vertically. It is like a vertical stretching of these colored 2x2 shapes. Each point increases 1 point to up and down but never expand more than the size of the grid. Do nothing with the cells not affected by the color expansion, these remain black.\\\\n57. To make the output, you have to replicate the upper symbol below itself and the lower symbol above itself so that both symbols meet exactly in the middle of the grid. The area which was originally occupied by the upper symbol should now be occupied by the lower symbol and vice versa. The rest of the grid remains black.\\\\n58. To obtain the output grid, follow the following transformations: 1. If there\\\\\\'s a vertical line of green squares on the left of the grid, extend it to the right until it reaches an obstacle, keeping the distance between the green squares and the obstacle the same on both sides. 2. If there\\\\\\'s a vertical line of teal squares on the right of the grid, extend it to the left until it reaches an obstacle, again keeping the distance between the teal squares and the obstacle the same on both sides. 3. If there\\\\\\'s a mid-length horizontal line of yellow square on the left of the grid, move it to the center and duplicate it such that it makes a square with the upper line. 4. If there\\\\\\'s a mid-length horizontal line of brown square on the right of the grid, move it to the center and duplicate it such that it makes a square with the bottom line. Briefly, the transformation seems to take each pattern and extend it in the opposite direction, maintaining symmetry.\\\\n59. To create the output grid, locate the isolated color configurations in the input. Each distinctly colored region is transformed as follows: the color configuration is extended in both vertical directions until it hits another color or the grid limit. The color used for extension is the color that is most common in the particular circlelike region.\\\\n60. The transformation rules are as follows. For any colored point inside the smaller figures, place a similar lesser circle around it but keep the colour of new size same as the point.\\\\n61. To make the output, you have to  1) Keep the green shape at the same place.  2) Move the red squares to the middle of the grid, creating a plus sign (+). 3) Extend the red squares with the additional color that\\\\\\'s present in the green shape (yellow or blue). It seems the blue square in the green shape is guiding how to extend the red squares. If it is in the horizontal direction the red squares are extended horizontally, and if it\\\\\\'s vertical, the red squares are extended vertically.\\\\n62. To make the output, you have to follow these steps. First locate the colored shapes that are not in the center area of the grid. Then, you need to create a mirrored version of these shape that is reflected across the central vertical axis. Any color in the input should be kept the same color in the output. The cells that don\\\\\\'t have a colored shape stay black.\\\\n63. To make the output, you have to follow these steps. First find the repeating pattern in the bottom half of the image, then take this pattern and expand it around the existing pattern in the top of the grid. For example, if the shape is a two pixel wide vertical line, then add this pattern to the top, bottom, left, and right of the existing pattern. The new pixels you add should be of the same color as the existing pattern.\\\\n64. To make the output, firstly find a square of a color that is not black in the top of the grid. After finding that square, you should expand it one block both of the top and the bottom. Then, you should find a square of a different color that is not black at the bottom. After finding that square, you should expand it one block both top, bottom, left and right. The remaining parts of the output array would be identical with the input array.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "After analyzing the rules, they can be categorized into eight distinct categories based on their similarities:\n\n1.

To make the output, you have to generate a filled square in the color corresponding to the input pixel. The filled square is centered around the colored pixel position. If there is more than one colored pixel, there will be more than one corresponding square in the output. The filled squares have a size of 11x11 and are surrounded by a black square of size 13x13. The top left of the largest square will be located 8 units to the left and above the original colored pixel. Any point which is not part of the square or its surrounding black frame is kept identical to the input.\\\\n2. To make the output, you have to detect the position of each colored spot in the input grid and draw a symbol as follows: horizontal line across the full grid at this vertical position, vertical line across the full grid at this horizontal position, a smaller square structure with the colored spot at its center if it is above the vertical midline of the grid, a large square structure covering the grid\\\\\\'s full width and height if the colored spot is below the vertical midline of the grid.

The star should consist of a horizontal and vertical line crossing at the dot, each 3 cells long in both directions, plus diagonal lines through the dot, each 2 cells long in both directions. The rest of the grid should remain black.\\\\n4. To make the output, you have to identify the location of colored cells in the input grid. Then you draw a central square of the same color, the side of the square equals the side of the grid divided by 3. This is followed by smaller squares at the edges of the bigger square. The side of the small squares equals the side of the grid divided by 6. The corner cells of the squares are also colored.\\\\n5. To make the output, you have to place a small, bordered 7x7 grid at each colored cell\\\\\\'s location from the input. The border is the color of the cell from the input while the remaining cells in the 7x7 grid are black, apart from a colored cross in the middle. The color of the cross is also same as the colored cell from the input. If the 7x7 grid extends off the edge of the large grid, only draw as much as fits on the grid. At the bottom of the grid place a row of the colors seen in the input (In the order they are placed on the grid from top to bottom). The final output should be a large grid with these small, bordered 7x7 grids and a colored strip at the bottom.\\\\n6. To make the output, you have to follow the following steps: - Draw a bigger square with the color filling, this square is filled only with the existing colors on the original grid. - Draw a smaller square the same way, inside the bigger one, leaving a one-cell border with the color filling between them. - Draw even smaller squares inside the other square, again leaving one-cell border with the color filling between the squares. - Keep drawing smaller squares inside until you reach the original colored spots. The original colored mean a square has to be built and all squares can be in different sizes as per the colored position in the original grid. - If there\\\\\\'s no color in the input grid, output the same input.\\\\n7. To make the output, you have to draw a pattern around the color dot(s) as follows:  1. Draw a square border immediately adjacent to the dot(s), where the square is colored from inside to outside. 2. If the colored dot(s) are along the same row, draw a consistently colored straight horizontal line that cuts across the entire grid. 3. If the colored dot(s) are arranged along the same column, draw a consistently colored straight vertical line that cuts across the entire grid. 4. Draw a larger square encompassing the previous squares. Leave the corners of the larger square uncolored.  5. Repeat step 4 three times. 6. If the colored dot(s) only inhabit one row or one column or both, draw a final border across the edge of the grid. 7. The rest of the grid should remain black.  8. Note that if there\\\\\\'s more than one dot, the patterns intersect, creating a combined pattern.\\\\n8. The transformation works by taking each non-black (colored) point in the input and placing it at the center of a cross-shaped structure of the same color in the output, taking into account that the arms of the cross reach the edges of the grid in the horizontal and vertical direction. This cross-shaped structure doesn\\\\\\'t overwrite existing structures (i.e., overlapping cross arms will be the color of the point that was placed first in that position). For the last point placed, a border of the same color circumference, touching the edges of the grid, is formed around the cross-shaped structure. Note that the sequence of points placed might vary but the rules will always apply.\\\\n9. To generate the output, the given input grid is rotated 180 degrees. Once the rotation is complete, the colored cells should be outlining the shape of an arrow pointing in a certain direction. They will form a border of thickness 1 around the arrow. The color of the border and the arrow will be the same as that of the colored cells in the input grid, and the direction of the arrow will indicate the position of the original colored cells after the grid has been rotated. Specific transformations are as follows: - When the colored cell in the input is at the center, the output will have an arrow in the shape of a plus (+) sign. - When the colored cell is above the center, arrows in the output point upwards. - When the colored cell is below the center, arrows in the output point downwards. - When the colored cell is to the left of the center, arrows in the output point to the left. - When the colored cell is to the right of the center, arrows in the output point to the right. - If there is more than one colored cell, a\\\\n10. To make the output, you have to transfrom the input grid by first determining which color squares are in the grid. Then, for each colored square, create a filled square at the edges of the output grid for every bordering black cell in the input grid. Keep the fill color the same as the original.\\\\n11. To make the output, Draw four horizontal and vertical lines passing through the colored points. At the intersection of each two lines, draw a square whose edges are the intersecting lines. In case of multiple colored points, only consider the colored point with the minimum row and column indices. The lines and squares are formed by coloring the corresponding cells with the color of the chosen point.\\\\n12. To make the output, you have to create a cross mark (consisting of dot lines) of the color in the input which cuts through the initial colored cell point. The rest of the cells remain black.\\\\n13. To make the output, you have to look at the colored spots in the input grid. From each colored spot in the input, draw a horizontal, vertical and diagonal line towards the center of the grid until it encounters another non-black square or reaches the border of the grid. The line thickness should be one square. The colored spots will be the intersection points of these lines. Fill all the squares that were not on any lines with the number 0 (Black).\\\\n14. To make the output, you have to look for the cells in the input grid that are not black. For each colored cell you found, draw a square around that cell in the output grid. The size of the square should align with the grid\\\\\\'s boundary and its center should be coincident with the colored cell. All cells inside the square should be the same color as the dot, while cells outside remain black.\\\\n15. To make the output, you have to draw two concentric squares and a cross, all centered around the initially colored dot. The outer square fills the grid vertically. The second square is 1 cell smaller on each side and the cross is 2 cells smaller on each side than the second square.\\\\n16. To make the output, you have to create a square border of the color equal to the color of pixel in the input. The size of the square should be equal to the length of the grid side, and it should be positioned in the same place as the pixel in the input. If the pixel is in the center of the grid, then fill the entire grid with the pixel\\\\\\'s color.\\\\n17. To make the output, you have to replace black cells following the pattern of creating a larger dot (like an eye) with the colored dot in the center. The larger dot (eye) is 5x5 cells with the center being a 3x3 square of the colored cells. This larger dot (eye) is repetitively formed throughout the grid until the bottom, leaving space between all of them in the pattern of two black cells horizontally and vertically. The bottom line of this eye pattern stops 4 cells from the bottom. Then, fill the second bottom line entirely with the colored cell. After that, just leave the last line black.\\\\n18. For transforming the grid, note the positions of the teal cells if there are any in the input grid. Then in the output grid, form a vertical, horizontal and diagonal cross pattern starting from each teal cell\\\\\\'s position. The cross pattern includes the draw of teal cells in the same row left and right of the initial teal cell, including itself; moreover, in the same column above and below the initial teal cell, excluding itself. In addition to that, we are drawing teal cells diagonally in all four directions: from top-left to bottom-right, from top-right to bottom-left, from bottom-right to top-left, and from bottom-left to top-right. But in the diagonal draw, we are excluding the original teal cell.   Lastly, at the 1st row, 1st column, last row, and last column we are drawing teal cells entirely to enclose the picture in a border except the corners which should be black. If there are no teal cells in the input grid, then the whole output grid is black.   In other black cells, the original black position should be maintained. The output grid is mostly composed of black cells with some teal cells that form a specific pattern\\\\n19. To transform the input grid to output, start from the first teal box in the ascending order from the top of the grid. From this box, create 3x3 white squares around the teal box, until it intersects with another square. If it intersects, stop expanding the square at this point and continue with the remaining teal boxes in the same way. Finally, color the row where the last teal box is located and the bottom one with white.\\\\n20. To convert the input to the output, create an empty copy of the input grid. Identify the rows, columns, and diagonals where colored dots are located in the input grid. In the output grid, fill the relevant rows, columns, and diagonals entirely with the color of the dot, and keep the rest of the grid elements black.\\\\n21. To create the output grid, draw a line forming a diamond shape with the original 3 green pixels at three of its corners. Fill in the lines and the inside of the diamond with green, forming an outlined diamond in the image. The line should be a 1-pixel thick, and it starts from green pixel, goes half the width of the grid to the right, full height down, half width to the left, and then full height up. The last pixel from each line does not connect to create the diamond shape.\\\\n22. To make the output, you have to draw with green a bounding box encompassing all the teal points. The boundary should be away by 1-cell inward from each of the grid edges if no teal dots are present close by. If a teal dot is on the edge of the grid,all the side closer to the grid\\\\\\'s edge also will touch the grid edge and not be located inside the grid. Inside the bounding box, draw a smaller box with the same rules: 1-cell inward from the larger box\\\\\\'s edge or touching it if a teal dot is on it. Continue this process until no more bounding boxes can be formed. Represent the area inside but not the box walls with green for the small boxes inside the teal dots and leave remaining spaces black.\\\\n23. The cell with a number other than 0 in the input grid moves to form a pattern in the output grid. The three locations form the vertices of a right-angled triangle whose hypotenuse passes through the center of the grid. The grid is transformed to create a image made up of various shapes which includes a bigger equilateral triangle formed by the three vertices and smaller internal as well as external triangles.\\\\n24. To create the output grid, imagine a square border around the dot that extends to the edges of the grid. The inside of these four squares will completely become the color of the dot (within the border). Individual squares in the remaining area are colored by the nearest dot(using Manhattan distance). The top row will correspond to the farthest right dot, bottom row will correspond to the farthest left dot, and the far left and right columns will correspond to the highest and lowest dot respectively.\\\\n25. To form the output, the boundaries of a graveyard (in this case, rectangular enclosure represented by color) are drawn around each color in the input grid by leaving one block distance between the dot of color in all directions. The entire boundary and inner square of each colored dot become the same color. However, if the boundaries of one color overlapped with another color\u2019s boundaries, the overlapping boundaries, including the overlapping color, would become black. Finally, the sequence of colors from top to bottom is painted from left to right on the bottom side of the grid.\\\\n26. To make the output, you have to locate the colored box and create a square of the same color around the edges of the grid with each of its sides equidistant from the colored box and the edge of the grid. Inside this square, create another similar square that is one step closer to the colored box, and repeat this process until you reach the colored box itself. Fill any remaining space in the grid after reaching the colored box with black boxes.\\\\n27. To make the output, you have to create the structure of a game of Tic Tac Toe, maintaining the original colored cell as the center of the game board. If the original colored cell was teal (value of 3), the Tic Tac Toe structure should be filled with teal cells. If the original colored cell was brown (value of 2 or 8), the structure should be filled with brown cells. All the other cells should remain black.\\\\n28. To achieve the output, you should draw a square from the left edge of the grid to the colored block(s). The height of this square should be the same as the width of the grid. If there are two colored blocks, there should be two squares of different color. If the colored blocks are in different rows, the squares should overlap to form a rectangle in the middle. The left and right edges of the squares should be covered by the colored blocks. The top of square(s) should be a colored line stretching across the entire width of the grid. If a colored block appears in the last row of the input grid, a colored line should be drawn across the entire bottom of the grid.\\\\n29. To make the output, you have to craft the outline of a square where each green cell is found in the input. If the cell is green, change all the cells that would form a square around it to green. The square is defined as such that the green cell lies at the centre of this square in the output. Treat the edge of the grid as the boundary for forming these squares.\\\\n30. To make the output, you have to draw a smallest possible rectangle containing all in teal estimation running from left to right and top to bottom, then fill the inside of the rectangle in teal again. Note that the rectangle should only be drawn if there are 3 or more teal dots, and the rectangle itself should be 2 squares away from any teal dot.\\\\n31. To make the output, place a light blue square in the same position as the original colored square. The transformation involves forming a pattern around the location of the colored square in the shape of plus sign by replacing the black squares with light blue squares, along with a square border enclosing the plus sign.   The rules of the transformation are as follows: - Extend a line of light blue squares from the colored square to the edge of the square grid in north, south, east, and west directions. This forms a light blue plus sign. - Enclose the light blue plus sign within a square border of light blue squares. - The rest of the grid remains as black squares.   Note: The location of the original colored square is considered the center of the plus sign and the border.\\\\n32. To get the output, draw a 3x3 square around the cell with the color. Furthermore, draw a plus shape such that its center is the same colored cell extending up to the edge of the grid. For all cells that fall into these shapes, color them with the same colored cell value. Leave the rest of the grid black.\\\\n33. To make the output, you\\\\\\'ve to draw diagonals with green color which intersect at the points where the green squares are located in the input grid. Extend these diagonals, leaving a margin of one cell at the grid edge. If there is only one green square in the input, draw a square with the green square as the center. There should be no green square at the intersection of the diagonals.\\\\n34. The transformation seems to involve using the location of the colored pixel in the input grid as the center point of the output pattern. A series of rectangles are then drawn around the center pixel in the output, using the same color as of the center pixel. The rectangles grow in size and follow a pattern - two lines of pixels around the center pixel, then one empty line, and repeating. This pattern of empty space and colored lines continue until the rectangle reaches the edges of the grid.\\\\n35. To form the output grid, you should draw a green \"8\" shape at the center of the grid where the digit formed by green cells has equal width and height. Ignore the red or green cell in the input, as they only serve as the clue to draw \"8\" in the output. The placement of the digit \"8\" is symmetrical and centered and each vertical or horizontal stroke of the digit \"8\" is 3 cells wide. The cells outside and inside of the digit \"8\" shape in the output grid are black.\\\\n36. To create the output, draw the following shapes: - Draw a teal square bounding box that is three cells from the edge of the grid. - Draw a smaller teal square within the previous one, wrapped ten cells away from the edge. - Draw yet a smaller teal square within, two cells away from the edge of the previous square. - For the four teal cells in the input, find its mirrored position on the other side of the middle line of the vertical axis. Each of these cells and its mirrored counterpart form a cross shape. Form a hollow square shape by filling up the boundary of the square box that contains each cross shape perfectly, with only the corners of the square box being filled with the teal cells. - Finally, fill in the rest of the row at the bottom of the grid with teal cells.\\\\n37. From the position of the green dot in the input, create a larger square and a smaller square, both centered on the location of the green dot in the input. The outer square should be surrounded by a row of green cells, the inner square is filled with green cells and the cells between the two squares are empty (black).\\\\n38. To make the output, using the colored squares from the input grid, draw a vertical line, a horizontal line and diagonals through the entire output grid. Fill the intersection of lines with color to form a plus in the center of the grid.\\\\n39. To make the output grid, you have to make a square centred at the position where each green cell is located in the input, if that cell is the only green cell in its row. The side of the square would be as large as the distance between the green cell and the closest grid edge but not less than 5. The square extends equal distance from the center to the left, right, up and down directions and lined by red. The green cell which was the center becomes red too. This rule should be applied to every green cell in the input. If there are several green cells in the same row, the rule does not apply. The cells that do not fall under this rule remain black.\\\\n40. The output grid depends on the location of the teal cells in the input grid. If in the input grid, there is a teal cell at row x and column y, then in the output:  1. Replace all black cells in row x and column y with teal cells. 2. Replace all black cells in the rectangle formed by row x and column y with teal cells. 3. If there is a teal cell on the corners of the grid in the input, replace the entire row or column that touches the side of the grid with teal cells.\\\\n41. The transformation of the input seems like creating a large square with colored cells around the placed colored cells in the input. The center of the square is where the colored cell is placed in the input. The color of the square in output is same as the color of the cell in the input, except for the central cell of the square in the output which is black. If there isn\\\\\\'t any colored cell in the input, ignore it as black. There are two rows without any squares above and below the squares in the output grid, except for the bottommost row which has a long colored cells line.\\\\n42. To make the output, you have to find the position (row x, column y) of the first non-black cell. Position (0, 0) is the top left corner. Then, you build a 4x4 box (value 3), with the bottom right corner located at the initial non-black cell. After that, create a horizontal line (value 3) starting from (0, y) to (row x, y). These operations should be repeated for every non-black cell in the input. All the other cells remain black.\\\\n43. To make the output, you fill the entire perimeter of the grid with teal. Then paint a line of teal down the center of the grid. Within this line, create a box shape of teal around each teal pixel in the initial picture. For example if the pixel of teal was (r,c), then for the output the cells are colored teal from ((c-3, r-3) to (c+3, r+3)). Fill the remainder of the grid with black cells (i.e background) .  So the transformation involves, expanding the presence of each colored pixel into a box shape at their respective positions in the grid.\\\\n44. To make the output, you have to draw a bounding box (a rectangle) with color around all the pixels that appear colored in the input grid. The color of the rectangle should be the same as the color of the pixel in the input grid. The edges of the rectangle should touch the most left, right, top and bottom points where the colored pixel has appeared.\\\\n45. To make the output, you have to follow a few steps. If we represent a non-black cell as a point:  1. Draw a bounding square with the non-black points on the diagonals. 2. Draw a bigger square that fits the smaller one entirely inside. 3. Draw four lines across the bigger square from each corner to its opposite. 4. Fill each inner square bounded by the intersecting lines, with the same color, but leave the outermost layer black. 5. If there are no non-black cells in the input, then output the same unchanged grid.\\\\n46. To make the output, you have to identify the position of the colored cells in the input. At these positions, fill a 13x13 square starting from the colored cell position, the color of the fill is the same as the cell found in input grid. This 13x13 square is centered at the colored cell position surrounded by black cells. These squares filled with color in the output grid depict a digit \"0\" depending on the position of the colored cell in the input grid.    For example, if there is a colored cell at the 5th row and 8th column in input grid, it means we\\\\\\'re drawing the left boundary of the \"0\" digit at that position in the output grid. If there is a colored cell at the 13th row and 12th column in the input grid, it means we\\\\\\'re drawing the top boundary of the \"0\" digit at that position in the output grid. Similarly, we interpret other positions of the colored cells in input grid to complete the \"0\" digit in the output grid.   In case of multiple colored cells in the input\\\\n47. The transformation operates from roughly the center of the grid, which is located at the positions of individual colored pixels in the input. From these central points, vertical and horizontal lines of the same color are drawn outwards and meet the sides of the grid, thus creating a square shaped pattern. The lines don\\\\\\'t intersect with each other but continue as if uninterrupted when they overlap. This creates a multiple square pattern with the center points determined by the color pixel\\\\\\'s position in the input.\\\\n48. To make the output, you have to draw a square in the center of the grid that touches the edges of the grid horizontally. The color of the perimeter of the square is the same as the color of the pixel from the input. The pixels outside of the square should stay black. Inside the square, draw a smaller square that touches the larger square vertically with a black border and the same color inside. You should then draw a cross inside the inner square with the color of the pixel in the input(grids are making 90 degree angles with the outer edges of the inner square), and the rest of the inside part stays black. The pixels outside of the larger square should stay black.\\\\n49. To make the output, you have to generate a roof-like shape by following a few steps. The transformations are:  1) Transform the first row and column, the last two rows and columns into the color of the square in the input. 2) Repeat this process on the inner square, until you reach the colored square in the input, which, considering the figure as a house, would be the top of the roof. 3) The square right below the roof of the house should be the same color as the roof and its left and right squares should be black. 4) Go straight down painting the color of the roof until reaching the last but one line of the house. 5) From this line, paint the color of the roof to the left and right edges of the house. 6) This process should create a structure that looks similar to a colored house with a roof at its top.\\\\n50. To make the output, you have to get the coordinates of a colored point and then form an empty square (square with the colored borders and black inside) which has its center at the colored point\\\\\\'s place. The side of the square should be equal to the half size of the grid minus 2. This operation should be done for every colored point. Then make the border of the grid colored as well.\\\\n51. To make the output, the transformation employs a strict pattern. The pattern involves turning all the previous black cells outside of a specific central circular area into pink cells. The central area where the previous light blue cells were located, transforms into a larger square with a diagonal line from top-left to bottom-right. The inner square is composed of pink cells at its borders and the diagonal, while the rest of the cells remain black.\\\\n52. To make the output, you have to take each teal pixel from the input and shift it to the left border of the grid. Then on the row containing the teal dot, fill the rest of the row starting from the second column with teal dots until you hit a wall of teal dots or the end of the grid. If there is no teal dot on the row, left it black.\\\\n53. For the transformation, you would need to draw a large hollow lime square at a certain position in the grid. The top left of the square starts in the 5th cell on  the left and in the 2nd cell from the top. The bottom right of the square ends in the 2nd to last cell on the right and the 2nd last cell at the bottom. Outside the large square, paint a large solid line square in the border of the grid. The hollow square contains a smaller solid square, located at different places defined by the position of the color in the input grid. For example, if the color spot in the input grid was at 8th from left, 12th from top, the small square will be located 3 cells below the top of the hollow square and 3 cells to the right of the left side of the hollow square. The location of small squares inside the big ones change according to the positions of colored cells in the input grid.\\\\n54. To make the output, Place the color of the dot in the grid to form an inverted \\\\\\'N\\\\\\' pattern extending from the edges of the grid to the location of the colored dot. Fill this inverted \\\\\\'N\\\\\\' with the color except for the immediate surroundings of the colored dot. At the same time form a rectangular-shaped wall with the color from the edge of the grid to a row or column before the colored dot. The colored dot should be surrounded by a square of the color that is part of the wall and the inverted \\\\\\'N\\\\\\'. Then from the colored dot going along the diagonal down to the last row form a solid diagonal pattern with the color which continues along the last row of the grid to the last column.  This pattern resembles an hourglass tilted 45 degrees to the right or a pyramid with its top-right corner knocked off. In this transformation, the position of the colored dot determines the width of the upper half of the hourglass/pyramid shape.\\\\n55. To make the output, draw using the color of the input, an object that looks like a plus sign (+) that is a mirror reflection centered on the colored number. The length of the arm of the plus sign is until the boundary of the grid. The width of the plus sign is 3 cells. Fill the boundary of the grid with the color of the colored number until reaching the tips of the plus sign\\\\\\'s arms.\\\\n56. To make the output, you have to trace a square box surrounding each colored dot in the input grid and outline it with the corresponding color on the output grid. The colored dot determines the center of the box. Assuming that the placement of the colored dot is (x,y), the box will be the area of grid defined by (x-4, y-4) to (x+4, y+4). Make sure the colored square is thicker along the edge of the box making it look bolder.\\\\n57. To make the output, you have to create a border, using the color from the input, around the grid. In the center of the grid, you draw an \\\\\\'X\\\\\\', and at each quadrant between the borders and the \\\\\\'X\\\\\\', you repeat the pattern of the quadrant in the input. This pattern contains a block of colors in the middle of the quadrant.\\\\n58. The colored cells in the input grid are used as center points to carve out larger, square-shaped patterns in the output grid. To transform the input into the output, for each colored cell, make an equal-distance square around it. For the outer squares in the outer layer, color them. For the inner squares, alternate between coloring and not coloring each layer. The innermost square will only contain a colored square if it is the direct center of the entire grid. The color of the output squares matches the color of the input cell that caused them to be colored.\\\\n59. To make the output, you have to draw a square frame with the colored cell being its center. The scale of the square will be as large as the grid. The color of the drawn frame will be the same as the color of the cell. Repeat this for every colored cell in the input. The colored squares should overlay each other if they intersect.\\\\n60. To make the output, you have to create a concentric square (without corners) centered at the green point. The distance between the green point and the outer border of the square should be equal to the smallest distance between the green point and black box. If the distance from the green point to the all four sides are not equal choose the smallest one. If there are multiple green points, make individual squares for each point.\\\\n61. The transformation involves detecting the position of the colored box in the input grid and creating a square of the corresponding color at the same relative position in the output grid. In the output square, the color is filled in the edge cells of the square and one diagonal. The size f the square is enough to virtually touch the edges of the grid from its position.\\\\n62. To produce the output, you have to firstly outline the perimeter of the grid in green. Then, move to the center of the grid horizontally and vertically where a \\\\\\'cross\\\\\\' is drawn out however, it only extends up to two cells away from any green cell. All other cells remain black.\\\\n63. To make the output, you have to construct a grid pattern over the entire image that consists of three by three squares, each with a specific color pattern inside. The pattern consists of a ring of brown tiles around a central black tile. The size of the grid is adjusted to fit the size of the image. If a green point exists inside the space where the pattern is centered, turn the central black tile into green.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "Based on the similarities in the rules, they can be categorized into eight distinct categories as follows:\n\nCategory 1: Rules involving the creation of squares or rectangles around colored pixels.\nCategory 2: Rules involving the creation of lines (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) based on colored pixels.\nCategory 3: Rules involving the creation of specific shapes (cross, star, etc.) based on colored pixels.\nCategory 4: Rules involving the transformation of the grid based on the position of colored pixels.\nCategory 5: Rules involving the creation of patterns or structures (bounding box, game board, etc.) based on colored pixels.\nCategory 6: Rules involving the filling or coloring of certain areas based on colored pixels.\nCategory 7: Rules involving the rotation or shifting of the grid based on colored pixels.\nCategory 8: Rules involving the creation of specific symbols or figures (digit \"0\", \"8\", etc.) based on colored pixels.\n\nSynthesized rules for each category:\n\n1.

For each category, synthesize the rules into a single, specific rule that combines the ideas of all rules in that category, while clearly differentiating it from the other categories.\\\\nThe new rule should be as specific as possible, following the format of the given rules.\\\\nThe new rule should be applicable without any information from the original rules - i.e. it should be standalone.\\\\n\\\\nRules:\\\\n1. To make the output, you have to follow these steps. First, identify the columns that contain the blue rows. Second, disregard all elements in other columns and keep only the ones in the columns which contain blue. Next, remove the blue from the chosen columns but keep the rest of colors exactly as they were in those columns. Lastly, merge the two green bars into a single green bar in the output.\\\\n2. To make the output, you have to take the two vertical lines (3 and 4) and the figures that are in between. The figures should be copied in the same order they appeared, but each figure should occupy only one column, regardless of its initial width. All the figures must be placed between the two lines, leaving no black cell in between.\\\\n3. To create the output, you have to compress the input grid by removing every other column from right to left, starting with the second column from the right, until you reach the middle of the grid (green line). The output grid will have the line of green and teal, but with fewer columns in between.\\\\n4. To make the output, you have to disregard the black (\\\\\\'0\\\\\\') columns and bring the colored columns closer together. This effectively retains the height of the array while reducing its width, giving the appearance of a squeezed version of the input array.\\\\n5. To make the output, you have to cut the grid in half vertically. Keep the left half that has the green line and exclude the right half that has the orange line. No other modifications are necessary.\\\\n6. Transform the grid as a bottom-up approach. From the bottom of the grid, start scanning upwards and count non-zero numbers. Keep updating the top and bottom pointer. While updating pointers, keep track of the left most and the right most non-zero entry. After the end of scan, take a slice of the original grid from the top to bottom and left to right pointers. Apply pixel inversion (i.e, replace given color number with white) if it is not white.\\\\n7. To make the output, you have to keep the green central section and collapse the other colored lines so they form a single colored column adjacent to the green column. Now, you have half of the grid that has been reduced from the input, with first color on upper side and second color on down side.\\\\n8. The transformation involves a row-wise collapse of all the areas between the green and teal columns in the input to form a single row in the output. When collapsing, any non-black squares are turned into the color that appears most in the area to be collapsed.\\\\n9. To transform the input grid into the output grid, every second column on either side of the green line should be removed, starting from the first square touching the green line. Preserve the design and the order of colored squares as they appear horizontally. The green line and the brown line should also be preserved.\\\\n10. To make the output, you have to perform three steps: (1) remove all columns containing only blue or only black (2) only leave one column in place for each remaining pair of blue and orange columns, using the first color that appears from upper to lower in the blue column, or black if no color appears (3) finally, remove all black-colored cells left in the output.\\\\n11. To generate the output, the grid is compressed by removing the black units separating the columns. This results in preserving the rows but merging the colored units together, maintaining their vertical order. This operation condenses the grid horizontally.\\\\n12. To make the output it should consist of the following steps:  - Keep the colored vertical lines (green and teal) from the input grid. - Between the green and teal lines, keep the grid cells that are directly in between the two most distant red marks in the grid, and directly beside the red marks. - Keep the grey line if it is present. - All other cells should be turned black.  These steps give the output grid.\\\\n13. To make the output, you have to extract the column containing the unfinished vertical line (white or green), including the rows above, between and below the lines (blue and teal) from the input. This column forms the leftmost column in the output grid. The rest of the output grid on the right is formed from the fourth column right of the green line to the farthest right column in the input grid that contains at least one non-black pixel followed by a column of black cells.\\\\n14. To make the output, The green row is projected to the left of the grid on the output around this row the other squares are projected on a basis of whether their side color matched. If the color on the opposite side of the grid matched the left side, then the square is colored, otherwise it gets black. The rightmost edge is always painted as the right side on the input grid.\\\\n15. The transformation from the input to the output grid involves removing the rightmost part of the grid, past the 3rd column from the right. The vertical line in green (color 3) is shifted to be the first column on the left in the resulting grid, with the rest of the grid\\\\\\'s contents shifting rightward accordingly. All the columns right side of this line in the input grid are deleted.\\\\n16. To make the output, you have to filter out some columns from the input grid. More specifically, only every fourth column starting from the left should be kept in the output. Additionally, the fourth column from the right side of the input grid should also be kept. All other columns will be skipped. The rows remain unchanged. The selection of the columns forms a striped pattern, as if you\\\\\\'re selectively compressing the input grid horizontally.\\\\n17. To make the output, you have to divide the grid vertically in half, excluding the mid-column. The left of the output comes from the left side of the input and the right of the output comes from the right side of the input. Any color from the middle stripe (teal in case 0, green in case 1 and 2) in the input should be turned black in the output.\\\\n18. To make the output, you have to pick up the two rightmost columns before the colored vertical line, followed by 6 columns to the right of the colored line. In case such columns do not exist, just fill them with black, and finally append the column of the colored strip to the right. The width of the output is always 9.\\\\n19. To create the output grid, you need to condense each band of colored cells to a single line in the output, carrying over all colors in the band. You need to preserve the vertical order of bands from the input in the output. Strip off columns where black cells are in the rows on the same vertical level as the green and red bands in the input. The rest of the columns are condensed into one single column in the output. The rightmost non-black cell in each row of the input corresponding to the blue and orange band and the cells corresponding to the the black region of the input between the two bands, are appended to the respective rows in the output. Essentially, the transformation removes all black regions, except the ones to the right of the green and red bands, and condenses each band to a single row.\\\\n20. To make the output, you have to remove every other column starting from the first column. So we are removing the 1st column (index 0), third column (index 2), fifth column (index 4) and so on. This effectively decreases the width dimension of the grid by around half, preserving the lines and shapes in the original grid but in a reduced width. This operation can also be thought of as horizontal compression.\\\\n21. To make the output, you have to remove each second column in the input data (beyond the vertical color separator - here green & blue cells). The structure of color and black cells remains the same. All the rows are preserved, but every odd-numbered column is eliminated, starting from the leftmost column after the green & blue vertical line.\\\\n22. To make the output, you have to take all the colors of the input that are in columns to the left of the teal column (4) and arrange them in the same horizontal order they appear from top to bottom in the input grid. Add the teal column at the end of all lines in the output grid. Do not include the green column (3) or any other columns to the right of the teal column in the output.\\\\n23. To make the output, you have to compress the input grid. The columns to the left of green vertical line (excluding green line) are compressed into one column by taking maximum of the numbers in the column and the column to the right of green line is compressed into another column similarly. The green line remains the same. This process reduces width of the grid to one third.\\\\n24. To make the output, you have to trace back vertically along the green stripe column until you find first non-black cell. Then go along this row horizontally towards the yellow stripe column until you find first non-black cell there. Then draw a rectangle using these two points as corners. Repeat the process until no more rectangles can be drawn. The flag-like structure that is left is reflected in the output grid.\\\\n25. To get the output, remove the two farthest columns (on both left and right) and keep the rest. The middle strip of color (green) stays on the far left, while the yellow patterns and the teal lines retain their respective positions and patterns.\\\\n26. To make the output, you have to reflect the lower half of the grid on the upper half. Firstly, the height is reduced by merging every two rows into one whereby the lower most cell takes preference in color, if the lower cell is black, use either of the two. Secondly, the sides are cut off by reducing every three columns into one with the middle color taking preference, if the middle cell is black, use either of the two.\\\\n27. To make the output, you have to shrink the grid keeping only the cells that intersect at the location of the green line and any non-black element. The first (leftmost) and last (rightmost) columns keep all non-black cells. All remaining black cells are removed.\\\\n28. To create the output, you need to half the rows and columns of the grid starting from the center and going outwards. Keep the central column and every 2nd line from there, counting to left and right. Apply the same rule to rows, centred around the continuous line in the grid. Use the max color number in these reduced rows and columns.\\\\n29. To make the output, you have to collapse the input grid to 9 columns. Keep the 6th and 17th columns as is. For the columns in between the two colored lines (columns 7-16), if there is a colored cell, use that color to fill the corresponding cell in the output. If there are multiple colors, use the color that is found in the lower row. If there are no colored cells, fill the cell with black. For the columns before the first line and after the second line, fill the cell with black.\\\\n30. To create the output grid, take 2x2 boxes from the input grid and map them to a single cell in the output grid. For each 2x2 box, if the cell contains a blue stripe, map it to a blue cell in the output. If the cell doesn\\\\\\'t contain a blue stripe but has a green stripe, map it to a green cell in the output. If the cell doesn\\\\\\'t contain a blue or green stripe but has a red square, map it to a red cell in the output. If the cell has none of the above elements, map it to a black cell in the output.\\\\n31. To transition the input to the output, discard every alternate column starting from the second column. Finally, collapse each pair of adjacent cells in the remaining columns to a single cell choosing the color of the cell above.\\\\n32. To make the output, you should take every second row of the original grid (starting from the first row). After that, in every row take every second cell of it (starting from the third cell).\\\\n33. The transformation involves taking elements along the two vertical columns and one horizontal row in the input. The column on the left and the row become the first column and row in the output. The right column in the input becomes the last column in the output. However, only the cells at the intersections of the row and columns in the input are included in the output.\\\\n34. To make the output, you have to compress the input grid horizontally by half (rounding down if necessary) and copy the rightmost color of each input row to the rightmost column of the output row. The green strip stays as it is.\\\\n35. To make the output, you have to perform a column compression or folding process. Each pair of columns in the input should be folded onto each other such that the resulting pair in the output displays the maximum non-black color value from each pair of the initial columns. This works by considering the columns in pairs from outside in (i.e., (first, last), (second, second last) etc.), folding them onto each other and keeping maximum non-black value. However, the central column in the input should resemble as it is in the output, otherwise, just keep the maximum colored cells and replace black cells with the maximum colored cell from each pair of columns.\\\\n36. To make the output, start by keeping the green and orange dividing lines from the input. Then, in each row, remove any black cells and pull the colored cells next to the dividing lines. After this, remove any empty columns on both sides.\\\\n37. To make the output, you have to remove two columns from the input field for every non-blue column, leaving only single columns of colors. The blue columns are collapsed into single columns as well. The column farthest to the right in the input becomes the column farthest to the right in the output. The output consists of only every 3rd column from the input, counting from the left.\\\\n38. To form the output, you need to keep every other row and every other column from the input, starting with the first row and column. This downscales the image height and width by half, removing the fuschia lines and simulating a compression effect.\\\\n39. To transform the input to the output, column by column,  replace every two column, starting with the first with the middle column between them. Then remove the remaining rightmost column.\\\\n40. To transform the grid to output, divide it into four quadrants, separated by a line of numbers. Take the lower diagonal half, and eliminate every second column starting from the second column. Do the same for rows, starting from the first row. The resulting quadrant should be the output grid.\\\\n41. To make the output, you must take the columns between the green and the teal vertical lines from the input grid, including those lines themselves, and reduce every two columns into one by taking the greatest value from each pair of columns. The comparison must be made for comparative in vertical direction for every cell not for the entire column.\\\\n42. First, divide the input grid vertically into three equal parts. The first part contains the left third of the grid, the second part - the middle third, and the third part - the right third of the grid. Then, in each part remove the even-numbered columns starting from 0 (so, remove 0th, 2nd, 4th columns and so on). After this operation, concatenate these parts back together in the same order.\\\\n43. To make the output, you have to  reduce the size of the grid by removing every column except the 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th, and 18th. All indices are 0-based. This means that only the three columns on either side of the two columns that are the same in the input should be kept, and the last of these same columns should also be kept in the output.\\\\n44. To make the output, you have to draw a vertical line on the center of the grid, and mirror the coloured lines from right to left side in a symmetrical manner. The number 4 that originally separates the coloured lines on the input was extended and act as a boundary for each mirrored line segment. So, all mirrored segments are separated by the number 4.\\\\n45. To create the output grid, compress each pair of columns in the input grid into one column in the output grid, with the exception of the yellow and purple border columns. For the compressed columns, fill the output cell with the color that is present in most of the two input cells (e.g., two blues become one blue, one blue one black becomes one blue). If there is a tie, fill the output cell with the non-black color. The yellow and purple columns in the output grid should be the same as their corresponding columns in the input grid.\\\\n46. To generate the output, take only the columns containing numbers 3 and 4, and the columns containing elements other than 0 in between them. Keep only every second row starting from the first. Maintain the first three columns on the left unchanged and replace any number other than 0 with 4 in the rest of the grid.\\\\n47. To transform the input grid into the output grid, condense all identical horizontal color bars to the width of 1 cell and align them from left to right in order of appearance. Preserve the green and teal lines on their original positions. Another important transformation is the removal of the black cells.\\\\n48. To make the output, you have to commit the following steps. First, eliminate the horizontal lines of black cells splitting the grid into pieces. Then, combine all the lines of colored cells into one block with the yellow line acting as the separator.\\\\n49. To make the output, you have to remove the black cells that are bordering the left or the right of the vertical colored lines, then collapse the remaining grid. The remaining grid should have columns of colored numbers, with the first column and the last column should be different colors that appear on the edges of vertical lines in the input, and all of the remaining columns should be the same color that appear in between these two colors in the input. If any single colored number appeared in the area between the two vertical lines in the input, the corresponding column at the output should be entirely filled with this color.\\\\n50. To transform the grid, identify the green (3) column and teal (8) column. Extract the part of the grid that falls between these two columns, inclusive of the columns themselves. The number of rows remains unchanged, while the number of columns reduces. In other words, the transformation rule can be: \u201cExtract the slice of the original grid from the green column to the teal column\".\\\\n51. To make the output, you have to perform a \"compression\" operation on the input. This means combining the two adjacent color cells into a single cell and doing that for all the cells. All the Black (0) color cells in the input are collapsed into one cell in the output, while the colored ones are preserved. However, the height of the grid remains the same, meaning that the operation is only done horizontally. The grey line remains intact.\\\\n52. To make the output, you have to keep the squares that are between the green and teal lines vertically, and below the yellow line horizontally. Then, the colors should be reorganized to the new lines of the smaller grid, maintaining their vertical and horizontal sequence. In case of the loss of the blue rows, replace them with black.\\\\n53. To make the output, you have to follow these steps: 1. Split the input grid vertically where the green column is (this column should be the same height as the input grid and it\\\\\\'s colored entirely green) 2. Collapse these separated parts in towards the middle by detaching and removing the black cells to have a grid of height equal to the height of the input but with reduced width. 3. The right part of the output grid should be made up of the color from the right side of the input grid (without black cells) and green column from the center of the input grid while the left part has the color of the left side from input grid followed by green column.\\\\n54. The output gets created by taking the 5th column of the input and appending it to the left. Then Copy the last colored grid (represented by value not equal to 0) of each row and replace the rest of the items in that row with this copied value till the middle stripe (teal or red). The color of this stripe depends on the row\\\\\\'s color in the input grid. To this, append the colour of stripe from the input grid.\\\\n55. To transform the input grid into the output grid, you would carry out the following steps. First, remove the black rows and columns by replacing them with the rows and columns on either side of them (directly touching the yellow vertical line). Then, preserve the yellow line in the resulting grid. The left side of the grid is filled by copying the left side of the bisected input grid across the yellow vertical line to replace the black squares. The right side of the grid is filled by copying the right side of the bisected input grid across the yellow vertical line to replace the black squares. This will result in a condensed version of the input grid.\\\\n56. To make the output, you have to retain the color-green and color-teal squares and fill each area with the dominant color on the corresponding area of the input grid. If there are several dominant colors, the smaller index color prevails.\\\\n57. To make the output, you have to remove every second column starting with the first (index position 0, count start from 0). Then, take only the pixels from the upper half of the reduced columns. The number of rows remain the same as the original input while the number of columns becomes half.\\\\n58. To make the output, you have to perform a vertical compression of the grid. Only keep cells that are in the same column with and below the first occurrence of the special number (4 in the input). For the lines that the special number (4 in the input) appears more than once, keep the cells below the last occurrence.\\\\n59. To make the output, you have to discard the right half of the grid. In the remaining half, trim the array and discard black cells such that it condenses the left side of the input vertically upwards retaining the structure. The far right column should be made up of the teal boxes  (8) that previously ended each streak.\\\\n60. To transform the input into the output grid, keep the green line but replace the blue line with the pink line. In the area divided by the green and blue lines, use the pattern repeating in the input but reflect it vertically and horizontally. Do not change the pattern dividing by the green and pink lines.\\\\n61. To make the output, you have to remove the black cells and combine the respective colored cells on each side together to form the new expansion. This is essentially compressing the grid by removing the black cells and aligning the colored cells accordingly.\\\\n62. To make the output, you have to take every second column starting from the third column until you reach the penultimate column. Of these, remove all black cells. If a column with a single color remains from this process, it is reduced to single column with the same color. If a column that is not a single color remains, it is halved, retaining only the column left half of the original column. The order is retained from left to right.\\\\n63. To create the output, only take the blocks which are in line with the colored lines used to divide the sections in the input, and shift them to create a new grid. The sequence should be as follows: the block from the green line, the filled blocks from the first section to the green line starting from the top, and finally the block from the red line. Ignore any blocks if they are not colored (black or empty). The width of the output grid should be equal to the number of such blocks in one line.   In other words, the transformation extracts the colored vertical lines and the blocks from the leftmost section that contain color, discarding any black spaces and maintaining their relative positions and colors.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "Based on the similarities in the rules, they can be categorized into eight distinct categories as follows:\n\nCategory 1: Rules involving column selection and manipulation\nRules: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 11, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 29, 37, 39, 41, 42, 43, 49, 50, 51, 53, 57, 62\n\nSynthesized Rule: To make the output, select specific columns based on certain criteria (e.g., color, position, content), manipulate these columns (e.g., compress, remove, merge), and disregard the rest.

The output grid reflects the placement of fuschia squares to the left and right of the teal lines in the input. Think of the whole input pattern as being sandwiched horizontally to form the 3x3 grid. Make a blue cell in the output if there is a fuschia cell at the edge of the input grid. A cell in the center of the output grid corresponds to the cell closest to any teal cell in the input grid, at the same respective vertical position: if there is a fuschia cell, make the output blue, otherwise it\\\\\\'s black. For the leftmost and rightmost columns of the output grid, each cell corresponds to the fuschia cells that are one cell away from the teal cells of the input grid: if there is a fuschia cell, make the cell blue, otherwise it\\\\\\'s black.\\\\n2. For each of the nine squares, we turn it into a single cell in the output grid as follows: If there is a single cell of fuschia in the square then color the cell blue; if there are two fuschia cells in the square then color the cell black; if there are three fuschia cells in the square then color the cell red.\\\\n3. To make the output, you have to count how many purple squares are in the diamond-like shapes and display it in the corresponding position on the 3x3 grid. Also, replace any counts above 1 with 1 and leave 0s as they are.\\\\n4. To make the output, you have to look at the quadrants in the input grid. We will treat the upper-left quadrant as the first quadrant, the upper-right quadrant as the second quadrant, the lower-left quadrant as the third quadrant, and the lower-right quadrant as the fourth quadrant. If the number of fuchsia squares in a quadrant is more on the diagonal than off the diagonal, fill the corresponding grid cell in the output with a blue square. If not, fill it with a black square. Note that diagonals go from top-left to bottom-right in each quadrant.\\\\n5. To make the output, split the input grid into three equal parts maintaining their row structure. Now, sum all the gray (6) cells in each part and if the sum is even replace it with blue (1) in the output else with black. Repeat this operation for every corresponding cell of the smaller 3x3 grid. The parts of the input grid and the cells of the output grid have a positional correspondence. Top part of the input corresponds to the top row of the output, middle part to the middle row, and bottom part to the bottom row. Within each part or row, the left third corresponds to the left cell, the middle third to the middle cell, and the right third to the right cell.\\\\n6. To make the output, you have to count the total number of fuschia colored cells in each of the 9 smaller grids. If a smaller grid has 1 fuschia cell, the corresponding cell in the output should be blue, if a smaller grid has 2 fuschia cells, the corresponding cell in the output should be black, and if a smaller grid has 3 fuschia cells, the corresponding cell in the output should be black as well.\\\\n7. To make the output, you have to divide the input into 4 equal squares (excluding the teal lines in the calculation) and count the number of fuchsia balls in each square. After that, map the balls to blue if they\\\\\\'re in the position of top left and bottom right squares, or to black if they\\\\\\'re in the position of top right and bottom left squares of the resultant 3x3 grid. Also, if there\\\\\\'s no fuchsia ball in some small square of the input 4x4 grids, treat it as black cell in the output grid.\\\\n8. To make the output, take each of the three sections of the input grid and condense them into a single row of the output. Each row should have three cells, corresponding to the left, middle, and right columns of that section in the input. If the column in the input contained any fuschia cells, then the corresponding cell in the output should be blue. If the column in the input didn\\\\\\'t contain any fuschia cells, then this cell in the output should be black. Apply this rule for each of the three sections to get the final 3x3 grid.\\\\n9. To make the output, you have to observe the four 5x5 squares in the input. The order of checking the positions within the 5x5 square is as follows, first the center (3rd row and 3rd column), then the first row (1st column), and at last the last row (5th column).   For each square, if there are no colored blocks in the position being checked, fill that position in the corresponding 3x3 output grid with black. If there are 1 or 2 colored blocks in that position, fill the position in the output grid with blue. If there are more than 2 colored blocks in the position, fill the position in the output grid with red. The top left square maps to the top left 3x3 section on the output grid, the top right to the top right 3x3 section, the bottom left to the bottom left, and the bottom right to the bottom right.\\\\n10. In the output grid, if there are more fuchsia boxes than black boxes in the respective input grid 3x3 square, color the box blue (1); otherwise, leave it black. Start from the top left 3x3 square and move right, then down, maintaining the position of each square in the output grid.\\\\n11. To make the output, you have to count the number of fuschia pixels in each 4x4 grid compartment bordered by the teal cross lines in the input grid: top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right (from left to right and from top to bottom) and compare it with the central compartment: - If the number is the same, the corresponding pixel in the output will be black. - If the number of fuchsia pixels in the external compartment is more than the central compartment, the corresponding pixel in the output will be blue. - If the number of fuchsia pixels in the external compartment is less than the central compartment, the corresponding pixel in the output will be black.  The output will reflect this comparison arranged in the same 3x3 grid pattern as the input.\\\\n12. 1. Divide the square into thirds, vertically and horizontally. 2. For each of these thirds, count how many fuschia pixels exist. If there are 1 or less fuschia pixels present, color the corresponding third in the 3x3 output grid black. 3. If there are 2 fuschia pixels present, color that section blue. 4. If there are 3 or more fuschia pixels, color that section red.\\\\n13. Each quadrant of the input grid should be considered as a single cell in the output grid, making a 2x2 grid in the output. Each cell in the output should be filled with the color blue if the corresponding quadrant in the input has more fuchsia cells on the right half than the left half. If the fuchsia cells in the left half of the quadrant are the same or more than on the right half, fill the output cell with black.\\\\n14. To make the output, you need to map every 3x3 black square into one single cell in the output. The logic for the deciding the color of the cell based on the fuschia locations is as follows. If there is a fuschia in the top row, the top cell in the corresponding 1x3 column of the output should be blue. If there is a fuschia in the middle row, the middle cell in the corresponding 1x3 column of the output should be blue. If there is a fuschia in the bottom row, the bottom cell in the corresponding 1x3 column of the output should be blue. If there are no fuschia in a particular 3x3 square of the input, the corresponding cell of the output should be black.\\\\n15. To make the output, you have to count the amount of Fuschia dots in each quarter of the grid separated by the teal line. Place a blue square in the corresponding position in the output grid if there are two or more fuschia dots in that quarter. If less than two, leave the square in the output grid black.\\\\n16. To transform the input to output, first divide it into four 5x5 squares. For each of the squares, if there is at least one fuschia dot on the teal line, place a blue dot in the corresponding quadrant of the output grid. If there is no fuschia dot on the teal line in a square, that quadrant in the output grid should be black. The upper-left square corresponds to the upper-left quadrant in the output, the upper-right square to the upper-right quadrant, the lower-left square to the lower-left quadrant, and the lower-right square to the lower-right quadrant.\\\\n17. To make the output: - Divide the input grid into 4 quadrants using the teal cross. - Map each quadrant of the input to a quadrant of the output. - If a quadrant in the input has one fuchsia cell, make the corresponding quadrant in the output blue. - If both upper quadrants of the input have one fuchsia cell each, fill the corresponding upper quadrants in the output with blue. - If the bottom left quadrant of the input contains one fuchsia cell, fill the bottom right quadrant of the output with blue. - If both lower quadrants of the input contain one fuchsia cell each, fill the corresponding lower quadrants in the output with blue.  - Ignore the positions of the fuchsia cells within their quadrant. - Keep the rest of the cells in the output black.\\\\n18. To make the output, you have to consider the color shapes partitioned by the light-blue lines. If a partition caters more than one red squares, fill that partition in the 3x3 output with blue. If a partition contains only one red square, fill that partition in the 3x3 output with black. If a partition does not contain any red square, fill that partition in the 3x3 output with black as well.\\\\n19. Each cell in the output correspond to one quadrant in the input. If a quadrant has three fuschia cells, it maps to the blue cell in the output. If a quadrant has two fuschia cells, it maps to the black cell in the output. If the quadrant doesn\\\\\\'t have any fuschia cells, it maps to the empty cell in the output.\\\\n20. The transformation is based on the location of fuschia squares in each quadrant of the input grid. Start from the top left quadrant and work clockwise. If a fuschia square is at the top left position, place a blue square at the top left of the output grid. If the fuschia square is in the middle position, place a blue square in the middle of the output grid. If the fuschia is at the bottom right position, place a blue square at the bottom right of the output grid. If there\\\\\\'s no fuschia square, the respective position in the output grid will be black. Repeat this process for every quadrant. If there are multiple fuschia squares in the same position across different quadrants, use only the fuschia square from the top-left quadrant for that position.\\\\n21. The transformation rule seems to involve the positioning of the fuschia dots in each section. In each 3x3 section, a blue \"1\" is placed where there\\\\\\'s a column in the corresponding section of the input that contains two fuschia \"6\"s. Elsewhere, the cell is filled with a black \"0\".\\\\n22. To make the output, you have to count the number of fuchsia squares in three specific rows in the top half and bottom half. The rows are top, middle and bottom rows. Depending on the count in each row, do the following:  - If a row both in the top half and bottom half have the same number of fuchsia squares, put a black (0) square in the corresponding row of the output. - If a row both in the top half and bottom half have different number of fuchsia squares, put a blue (1) square in the corresponding row of the output.    The left-most square in the output corresponds to the top row, the middle to the middle row, and the right-most to the bottom row. Repeat this for top and bottom halves to fill the entire output grid. Always put the outcome for the top half on the top row of the output grid, and the bottom half on the middle and bottom rows.\\\\n23. Each cell in the output corresponds to a 3x3 subgrid in the input. If a subgrid in the input contains 1 fuschia colored box, the corresponding cell in the output will be blue. If a subgrid in the input contains 2 fuschia colored boxes, the corresponding cell in the output will be black. If a subgrid in the input contains 3 fuschia colored boxes, the corresponding cell in the output will be black. If there are no fuschia colored boxes, the corresponding cell in the output is also black.\\\\n24. To make the output, you need to map each quadrant of the input to a single cell in the output. Starting from the top left quadrant and moving clockwise, look for the position of the fuschia cell in each quadrant. If the fuschia cell is located on the border, set the corresponding output cell to 1 (blue). If it is not on the border, set the output cell to 0 (black). The final 3x3 output matrix is composed of these values.\\\\n25. For each 11x11 grid between the fuschia lines in the input, count the number of grey cells. If there is a grey cell in the top-left, the corresponding position in the output grid should be blue; in the top-right, it should be black; in the bottom-left, make it blue if there is at least one gray cell and black if not; and in the bottom-right, make it black if there is more than one gray cell and blue if not.\\\\n26. To make the output, you have to count the number of fuschia squares in each quadrant of the input. Then map the number of fuschia squares to blue for 1 square, red for 2 squares, and black for no squares. The output grid should display these colors with each quadrant corresponding to the cell in the corresponding position: top left grid to top left cell, top right grid to top right cell, bottom left grid to bottom left cell, and bottom right grid to bottom right cell.\\\\n27. To make the output, you have to analyze the sequence of the fuschia squares. Divide the 11x11 grid into four 5x5 checkerboard patterns. For each of these checkerboards, determine whether there are more fuschia squares in black positions or in teal positions. If there are more in black positions, fill the corresponding position in the output with a blue square; if there are more in teal positions, fill it with a red square. If the number of fuschia squares in black positions and teal positions are equal, fill it with a black square.\\\\n28. To make the output, you should focus on each 3x3 grid (separated by the teal line) and mark the positions as follows:   - If the top corner grid (or something that corresponds to it) has 2 or more fuchia markings in any position, mark the top corner of the output grid as blue. - If the middle grid (or something that corresponds to it) has 2 or more fuchia markings in any position, mark the middle of the output grid as blue. - If the bottom corner grid (or something that corresponds to it) has 2 or more fuchia markings in any position, mark the bottom corner of the output grid as blue.  Leave those positions black where there are less or none of the conditions satisfied.\\\\n29. To make the output, you have to segment the input\\\\\\'s 11x11 grid into four quadrants divided by the teal lines. You then analyze each quadrant and where the fuschia squares reside. Match this with an equivalent 3x3 grid. The top left quadrant corresponds to the upper left pixel in the output. The top right to the upper right pixel and so on. Calculate the presence of fuschia squares with a simple rule: if there\\\\\\'s one or more fuschia squares in the center of the quadrant, set the corresponding output square to blue. Otherwise, set it to black.\\\\n30. To make the output, you have to check the grey-colored cells in each 5x5 square of the input grid before the teal line intersection. If a grey cell exists over the diagonal line from the top-left to bottom-right, then paint the equivalent cell in the output grid blue. Otherwise, leave it black. Note that the bottom left cell of the output grid corresponds to the top left 5x5 square of the input, and others follow in a clockwise direction.\\\\n31. To make the output, you have to divide the input grid into three equal parts along the teal lines. Treat fuschia squares as 1 and black squares as 0. For each part, calculate the sum of fuschia squares in the three rows, and arrange the sum of these rows from top to bottom in each corresponding cell of the output grid.\\\\n32. To make the output, you have to count the number of fuschia squares in each quadrant relative to their position. The result is:  - zero for no fuschia square, - one for a fuschia square in the top right or bottom left corners, - two for the presence of a fuschia square in both the top right and bottom left corners.  The four quadrants translate to the four corners of the 3x3 output grid in the following way: - Upper left quadrant translates to the upper left corner - Upper right quadrant translates to the upper right corner - Lower left quadrant translates to the lower left corner - Lower right quadrant translates to the lower right corner The center of the 3x3 output grid should always be black.\\\\n33. To get the output grid, we look at the grey cells in the 3x3 grids. For each cell in the blue output grid, if there are odd number of grey cells in the same position in the input\\\\\\'s 3x3 squares then value in the output grid will be blue. If the number of grey cells in the same position in the input\\\\\\'s 3x3 squares is even or there\\\\\\'s no grey cell at that position, the value in the output grid will be black.\\\\n34. To make the output, you must observe the placement of the fuschia color in the input grid before each horizontal teal line. The first 3 fuschia \\\\\\'s(fuschia color below the first teal line), from top to bottom, map onto the first row of the output, from left to right. Similarly, the second 3 fuschia \\\\\\'s(fuschia color below the second teal line) map onto the second row of the output grid, from left to right. If the fuschia color is on the left of teal line, then mark a blue color on the left of the corresponding row. If the fuschia color is on the right of teal line, then mark a blue color on the right. If fuschia color falls on teal line, then mark a blue color in the middle. Spaces with no corresponding fuschia are filled in black. The last row of the output grid is always filled in black.\\\\n35. To make the output, draw a 2x2 grid in each of the four quadrants in the input. In each quadrant, if there is a fuschia square within the projected 2x2 grid, color the corresponding square in the output grid as blue. If there are no fuschia squares within the projected grid, color the corresponding output square as black.\\\\n36. To create the output from the input, ignore the teal lines and only focus on the orange cells. Take each quadrant of the input and transcribe the existence and/or absence of orange cells onto 3x3 grid. If a quadrant has an orange cell in one cell, mark the same cell in 3x3 grid as blue. If there\\\\\\'s no orange, the corresponding cell in the output should be black. The order of quadrants to transform is top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right.\\\\n37. To make the output, count the number of grey dots in each quarter of the box. If there are two grey dots in a quarter, make the corresponding cell in the output blue, and if there are three grey dots in a quarter, leave the cell black. The position of the colored cells in the output corresponds to the positions of the quarters in the input following a left to right, top to bottom order.\\\\n38. To make the output, count the number of fuschia squares in each 3x3 grid section and transpose it to the output grid as blue squares. If the 3x3 grid section contains no fuschia square then transpose it as black in the output grid.\\\\n39. To make the output, we look at the position of the fuschia squares or lines in each quadrant separated by the teal lines. If a fuschia square or line is in the top part of the quadrant, we place a blue square in the top part of the corresponding output quadrant. If a fuschia square or line is in the middle of the quadrant, we place a blue square in the middle of the corresponding output quadrant. If a fuschia square or line is at the bottom of the quadrant, we place a blue square in the bottom part of the corresponding output quadrant. Cells in the output without a corresponding fuschia square/line in the input quadrant are left black.\\\\n40. To make the output, you have to count the number of fuchsia cells in each of the four quadrants. Each quadrant corresponds to a cell in the 3x3 output grid. If the number of fuchsia cells in that quadrant is one, assign a value of 1 in the corresponding cell of the output grid. However, if there are two fuchsia cells in that quadrant, assign a value of 0 in the corresponding cell of the output grid. If there are no fuchsia cells in a quadrant, also assign a value of 0 in the corresponding cell of the output grid. The final output grid should reflect the distribution of fuchsia cells among the four quadrants.\\\\n41. To make the output, you have to count the number of pink circles, separately, in the four corners of each of the two squares (grid partitions) and place their quantity in the corresponding position in the 3x3 grid. The count of pink circles should be represented as follows. If there are no pink circles, then the grid should be colored black. If there is exactly one pink circle, then the grid should be colored blue. If there are two or more pink circles, then the grid should be colored red. The position in the 3x3 grid should be determined by the position of the corner in the input grid: top left corner to top left grid, top right corner to top right grid, bottom left corner to bottom left grid, and bottom right corner to bottom right grid. The middle grid of the 3x3 grid should always be black.\\\\n42. To make the output, you have to check the presence of fuschia squares in each of the four quarters. For the top-left quarter, generate a blue (or 1) square in the top-left position of the output grid if there is no fuschia square in the input quarter. Do the same for the top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right quarters, generating the corresponding squares in the output. If a quarter in the input grid contains a fuschia square, fill the corresponding square in the output grid with a black square.\\\\n43. To make the output, you have to count the number of blue elements in each third of the input grid. The blue elements mean \"1\" and the number of blue elements are copied into a grid formed by dividing the corresponding output field into 3 slices vertically. If there are no blue elements in a slice of the original grid, the corresponding slice in the output field stays black. Thus, the output is a vertical count of blue presence per third in the input grid.\\\\n44. To make the output, split the input grid into four quadrants. For each quadrant, check if the number of fuschia dots is less than 2 and more than zero. If true, place a blue dot in the corresponding quadrant in the output. If there are no fuschia dots or more than one, leave the corresponding quadrant black. After checking all quadrants, rotate the grid 90 degrees clockwise.\\\\n45. To make the output, divide the larger grid into thirds according to the lines. On the top, middle and bottom sections, count the number of green squares. Each blue square in the 3x3 grid corresponds to one green square in each of the three sections of the larger grid, starting with the top section on the top row and so on. If a section has no green squares, that portion of the smaller grid will be black.\\\\n46. To make the output, you have to count how many sections contain two fuschia dots in the corresponding input. Transform the fuschia squares into blue squares in the output if there are two in the corresponding section in the input. If a section of the input does not have two fuschia squares, leave the corresponding cell in the output as black. Consider each set of four sections in the input (above and below the middle teal line) as corresponding to one cell in the output.\\\\n47. To obtain the output from the input, observe the position of the fuschia spots in the 7x7 boxes on the input grid. The different positions of the fuschia spots correspond to different positions in the 3x3 output grid. The output grid has a blue spot in the corresponding position for each fuschia spot in the input grid. If there is no fuschia spot in the corresponding position in the input grid, the position in the output grid is left black.\\\\n48. 1. Count the number of pink squares in each 3x3 section within the teal perimeter southward from top row. 2. Mark an index (starting from 0) for this count. If this count is zero, do not assign an index. 3. Place a \\\\\\'1\\\\\\' in the grid locations according to these indices, keeping a mirrored pattern in the output, with respect to original sections\\\\\\' symmetry. The remaining cells in output grid should be filled with \\\\\\'0\\\\\\' color.  4. The order of the indices should be maintained as top left, top right, bottom left and bottom right in 3x3 sections, preserving the vertical mirror symmetry of the 3x3 input sections.\\\\n49. To make the output, you have to consider the three partitions in input grid and transform them into three rows of output grid. Translate every fuchsia(6) in each partition into a blue(1) in the output grid according to the position of fuchsia in that partition. Consider the position of the fuchsia(6) with reference to the partition blocks area excluding the teal(8) filled line. If there is a fuchsia at the top, place a blue(1) at the top of the corresponding output row. If there is a fuchsia at the bottom, place a blue(1) at the bottom of the corresponding output row. If there is a fuchsia at both top and bottom, place a blue(1) at both top and bottom of the corresponding output row. Let the other places be black(0) in the output.\\\\n50. In the transformation, the presence of a single fuschia number in each of the four squares of the input results in one blue cell in the corresponding grid of the output. If two fuschia numbers are present in one of the squares, the corresponding cell in the output grid is a black cell. If no fuschia number is present in the square, output is also black for that corresponding grid.\\\\n51. To make the output, you have to map the distribution of fuschia squares on both sides of teal stripe into the respective side of the output, using them as coordinates of blue squares for the blue background. Here is how you can map them:  1. The leftmost fuschia square above the teal stripe maps to the leftmost square in the top row of the output grid.  2. The rightmost fuschia square above the teal stripe maps to the rightmost square in the top row.  3. The leftmost fuschia square below the teal stripe maps to the leftmost square in the bottom row of the output grid.  4. The rightmost fuschia square below the teal stripe maps to the rightmost square in the bottom row.    If there is no fuschia square on one side of teal stripe, that side of output grid should be left as it is, which is blue. If there is only one fuschia square on one side of teal stripe, it should coordinate the center square of respective side on the output grid.  The middle row of output grid remains unchanged during this transformation.\\\\n52. To make the output, first partition the input grid into four quadrants along the teal lines. Starting from the top-left quadrant and moving clockwise, place a blue square in the corresponding quadrant of the output grid if there are two or more fuschia squares in the original quadrant, otherwise, leave it black.\\\\n53. To make the output, you have to consider each quadrant of the input as a 3x3 subgrid in the output. In each quadrant, if there\\\\\\'s a fuchsia square in respective position, color the corresponding position in the output grid blue. Otherwise, leave it black.\\\\n54. To make the output, you have to divide the output grid the same way that the input grid was divided: into four squares. In the top left square of the output, put a blue circle if there was a fuchsia circle in the top left position of the top left input sub-grid. Do the same for the top right position in the top right square, the bottom left position in the bottom left square, and the bottom right position in the bottom right square. If there was not a fuchsia circle in that position of the input, leave that position black in the output.\\\\n55. To transform the input into the output, consider each section of the grid separated by the teal line as a 3x3 grid ignoring the last column and last row of each section.  For each cell in the new 3x3 grid, starting from the first section: If the cell contains 6 (gray colour), mark the corresponding cell in the output grid with 1(blue colour); If no 6(gray colour) is found, the cell stays 0 (black).  The rule applies to each section of the grid. Afterwards, do an OR operation between corresponding cells of the 3 by 3 grid obtained from the first section and the second section, replacing the cell in the first grid by the result of the operation. This gives the final output grid.\\\\n56. To make the output, you have to count the number of fuchsia-colored squares in each of the three sections of the input grid from top to bottom. If there is only one occurrence of a fuchsia square, mark a blue square in the corresponding region of the output grid, otherwise, leave it black. The top section of the input grid corresponds to the top row of the output grid, the middle to the middle row, and the bottom to the bottom row. Within each row of the output grid, the left column corresponds to the fuchsia square on the leftmost side of the input section, the middle column corresponds to the middle fuchsia square in the input section, and the right column corresponds to the rightmost fuchsia square in the input section.\\\\n57. To create the output grid, we divide the input grid into four smaller rectangles, separated by rows and columns of teal cells. The matching cell in the output grid is blue if there are even number of fuchsia cells in the corresponding rectangle in the input grid. If the number of fuchsia cells is odd, the cell in the output grid for that rectangle is black.\\\\n58. To create the output, you need to map the position of the fuchsia squares in each of the three squares (top, middle, bottom) of the input grid into a blue square on the output grid. The first fuchsia square in the top square of the input corresponds to the top left spot of the output; the next one to the top center spot; and the one after that to the top right spot. The same logic applies for the middle and bottom squares. If there\\\\\\'s no fuchsia square in a certain spot, the output will be black.\\\\n59. To transform the grid, you must analyze the quarters around the teal line in the input cells; rotate counterclockwise by 90 degrees in each quarter. For each rotating quarter of the input, each fuschia cube (6) that switches from being situated on the left of the teal line to the right of the teal line - or vice versa - is represented as a blue (1) in the corresponding quarter of the output. If no fuschia cube switches sides, the respective quarter is represented by black cubes in the output (0).\\\\n60. To make the output, you need to count the number of purple squares in each section of the input grid. In clockwise starting from the top left, put the number of purple squares in each section of the output grid, as a new number. Where no purple squares are present, that becomes a 0 in the output grid. Use black for 0, red for 1, and blue for 2.\\\\n61. To go from the input to the output grid, we conduct a form of counting operation in each quadrant of the main grid (top left, top right, bottom left, bottom right), separated by the large green squares and the black line.   In each quadrant, we count the amount of pink squares following this logic:  - If there are three pink squares in a given quadrant, place a blue square in the corresponding quadrant in the output. - If there is one or zero pink square in a given quadrant, place a black square in the corresponding quadrant in the output. - If there are two pink squares in a given quadrant, place a black square in the corresponding quadrant in the output.  Repeat this operation for each quadrant to form the entire 3x3 output grid.\\\\n62. To make the output, you have to divide the grid into 4 quadrants. Each quadrant should correspond to an output cell. Look at the center row or column in each quadrant. If the center row or column contains 1 fuschia cell, the corresponding output cell should be blue. If the center row or column contains 2 fuschia cells, the corresponding output cell should be red. If the center row or column doesn\\\\\\'t contain any fuschia cell, the corresponding output cell should be black.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 713}\")": "After analyzing the rules, they can be categorized into eight distinct categories based on their similarities:\n\nCategory 1: Rules that involve counting the number of specific colored cells in a certain area of the input grid and mapping the count to a color in the output grid.\n- Rules: 2, 3, 6, 10, 23, 26, 30, 38, 40, 42, 45, 50, 52, 53, 56, 60, 61\n\nCategory 2: Rules that involve mapping the presence or absence of a specific colored cell in the input grid to a color in the output grid.\n- Rules: 1, 8, 14, 21, 22, 28, 33, 34, 39, 41, 44, 47, 49, 54, 58\n\nCategory 3: Rules that involve dividing the input grid into quadrants and mapping the characteristics of each quadrant to a cell in the output grid.\n- Rules: 4, 7, 13, 16, 17, 19, 20, 24, 32, 35, 36, 42, 52, 53, 57, 62\n\nCategory 4: Rules that involve dividing the input grid into sections and mapping the characteristics of each section to a row in the output grid.\n- Rules: 5, 8, 22, 31, 43, 45, 49, 55\n\nCategory 5: Rules that involve mapping the position of a specific colored cell in the input grid to a position in the output grid.\n- Rules: 1, 14, 20, 24, 28, 34, 39, 47, 48, 54, 58\n\nCategory 6: Rules that involve counting the number of specific colored cells in each of the smaller grids within the input grid and mapping the count to a color in the output grid.\n- Rules: 2, 6, 23, 26, 38, 40, 50, 56, 60, 61\n\nCategory 7: Rules that involve mapping the characteristics of the cells along the teal lines in the input grid to the cells in the output grid.\n- Rules: 1, 7, 11, 16, 17, 32, 35, 36, 42, 44, 57, 59, 62\n\nCategory 8: Rules that involve mapping the characteristics of the cells in each of the four squares of the input grid to the cells in the output grid.\n- Rules: 9, 16, 27, 30, 36, 44, 54, 57, 59\n\nSynthesized Rules:\n\nCategory 1: Count the number of specific colored cells in a certain area of the input grid.

To make the output, you have to replicate and mirror the 3x3 grid both horizontally and vertically. This means you reflect the columns and rows, making the left half of the grid a mirror image of the right half, and the top half a mirror image of the bottom half; resulting in a symmetrical 6x6 grid.\\\\n2. To make the output, you have to first mirror the grid horizontally, and then stack the original grid over the mirrored version, to get a bigger grid. Thus, the enlarged grid is a reflection of the original grid both across the x and y axis.\\\\n3. To make the output, you have to convert the input grid into a 6x6 grid. This is achieved by taking the 3x3 grid, flipping it horizontally and appending it to the right side of the original grid. The resulting 3x6 grid is then extended to a 6x6 grid by vertically flipping it and appending it below. This results in a symmetrical pattern both horizontally and vertically.\\\\n4. The output grid is formed by repeating the input grid twice horizontally as well as vertically (in effect creating a 2x2 configuration of the input grid). Then, the diagonal from top-left to bottom-right is mirrored in both directions, replacing the second top-left and bottom-right quadrants of the grid.\\\\n5. To make the output, you have to mirror the input matrix in both the horizontal and vertical axes. This creates a 6x6 grid where the original 3x3 grid is reflected along the vertical and horizontal middle lines.\\\\n6. To make the output, you have to copy the input grid onto the top left and bottom right quadrants of the output grid, but reverse the order of the rows and the columns. Next, copy the transposed version of the input (flip the matrix diagonally) to the top right and bottom left quadrants of the output grid, but again, reverse the order of the rows and the columns.\\\\n7. To make the output, each cell in the input is copied once to the right and once down. The cells to the right are copies of themselves, creating a mirror image horizontally. The cells underneath are also copies of themselves, creating a mirror image vertically. This results in a mirrored pattern both horizontally and vertically.\\\\n8. To make the output, you have to double the input\\'s size in both its width and height. The 3x3 grid is filled out to 6x6 by creating a mirrored version of itself both vertically and horizontally.\\\\n9. To make the output, you have to mirror the 3x3 input grid both horizontally and vertically to form a 6x6 square. Each corresponding cell in the 3x3 sections of the output should match the original 3x3 input grid.\\\\n10. To make the output, you have to reflect the input vertically and horizontally. Imagine folding the input square along both the vertical and horizontal middle line, with the original on one side and a mirror image on the other. This folding should be done twice, once vertically and once horizontally.\\\\n11. To make the output, you have to reflect the 3x3 input over both the vertical and horizontal axis to form a 6x6 grid. It\\'s like mirroring the original grid along both axes to create a symmetrical pattern.\\\\n12. To make the output, you need to expand the whole input grid to the size of the output grid by mirroring it horizontally and vertically. More specifically, you take the 3x3 input grid, reflect it over its vertical axis and join it on the right. After that, take the result and reflect it over its horizontal axis and join it on the bottom to form a 6x6 grid.\\\\n13. To make the output, you have to mirror the input grid both horizontally and vertically. The central row and column should be counted only once. So, the rows and columns at the external sides of the grid can be mirrored for the rows and columns at the other side of the grid. Thus, if you fold the grid at horizontal middle line or vertical middle line, the two halves would be perfectly alike.\\\\n14. To create the output grid, take the input grid, duplicate it on the horizontal and vertical, and then mirror both duplications along the vertical and horizontal center axes. This results in a four-fold symmetric pattern.\\\\n15. To make the output, you have to mirror the 3x3 square vertically and horizontally creating a 6x6 square in all.\\\\n16. To make the output, you have to reflect the input grid over its vertical and horizontal center line, creating a symmetrical pattern, effectively making the input grid appear 4 times - as is, flipped horizontally, flipped vertically, and flipped both horizontally and vertically.\\\\n17. To make the output, you have to add a mirrored copy of the input below it, and then add mirrored copies of the two stacked grids to the right. The mirror image should be made along the middle axis.\\\\n18. To make the output, you have to reflect duplicate the original 3x3 grid across both the x and y axis. This is similar to the effect if you were to fold the image along both the vertical and horizontal midlines, copying the original 3x3 grid to all four quadrants of the 6x6 grid.\\\\n19. To form the output grid, you will reflect the 3x3 grid from the input both vertically and horizontally. This means the first row of the input becomes the first and last row of the output, the second row of the input becomes the second and penultimate row of the output, and the third row of the input becomes the middle two rows of the output. The same applies to the columns. This forms a symmetrical 6x6 grid whose pattern mirrors around the center of the grid.\\\\n20. To make the output, consider the input grid as subdivided into four quadrants (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right). The grid is transformed as though a mirror is placed diagonally from the top-left to the bottom-right: the original colours in the top-left quadrant are reflected to the bottom-right quadrant, the top-right to the bottom-left, the bottom-left to the top-right, and the bottom-right to the top-left. This mirroring operation results in a symmetrical 6x6 output grid.\\\\n21. To make the output, you should mirror the 3x3 input grid vertically and horizontally to form a 6x6 grid. The input grid should be the top left quadrant of the output grid. Proceed to reflect this quadrant along its vertical and horizontal axis to fill the remaining three quadrants of the 6x6 grid. This results in a symmetrical arrangement where the vertical and horizontal diagonal passing through the center of the grid acts as mirror lines.\\\\n22. To make the output, you have to enlarge the original grid to twice the size. The grid pattern is also mirrored both horizontally and vertically. Starting from the top-left cell, you move 3 steps to the right, mirroring the original 3x3 pattern, and continue to do so for subsequent rows. The bottom 3 rows are mirroring the pattern of the first three rows.\\\\n23. To transform the input grid into the output, you\\'re essentially mirroring the input grid both vertically (up and down) and horizontally (left to right). This makes the output grid a mirror image reflection of the input grid on both axes.\\\\n24. To make the output, one must mirror the input grid both vertically and horizontally. As a result, you get a 6x6 grid that is symmetrical along both the vertical and horizontal axes.\\\\n25. To make the output, you have to mirror the input along the vertical and horizontal axis. This means the grid is mirrored about its center to double the size.\\\\n26. To obtain the output grid, for each cell in the input grid, first copy the cell to the same position in the output grid, then copy the cell to its mirror image position (both horizontally and vertically) with respect to the center of the output grid. This process results in a symmetrical pattern that is a mirror image both horizontally and vertically.\\\\n27. To obtain the output grid from the input grid, you have to mirror the input grid both horizontally and vertically. This means you will flip the grid along both the horizontal and vertical axis to obtain a symmetrical 6x6 output grid.\\\\n28. To make the output, you have to double the size of the input grid in both horizontal and vertical dimensions and then mirror the original and new items on the center axes of the grid. You can imagine it as if you\\'ve expanded the original 3x3 area to a 6x6 area and then filled in this new, larger area by mirroring the original 3x3 squares on both the horizontal and vertical axes.\\\\n29. To make the output, mirror the entire input image in both dimensions (vertically and horizontally). Treat the center row and column as the line of symmetry, then duplicate and mirror the original input on the opposite sides of these lines.\\\\n30. To obtain the output, mirror the input grid both horizontally and vertically. Each row and each column should be read the same forward and reversed. In the output, the top left quadrant is a copy of the input, the top right quadrant is mirrored horizontally from the input, the bottom left quadrant is mirrored vertically from the input, and the bottom right quadrant is mirrored both horizontally and vertically from the input.\\\\n31. To make the output, you first need to reflect the input grid both horizontally and vertically, resulting in a 6x6 grid. The reflection should be done from the center grid point. For each 3x3 quadrant in the 6x6 grid, it should be a mirrored image of the original 3x3 input grid.\\\\n32. To make the output, you copy the input 3x3 grid twice to the right, then flip them left to right. Then take this complete line and copy it downwards twice and then flip the two lines top to bottom. Giving you a mirrored and flipped, tile-like repetition of the original 3x3 grid to form a 6x6 output grid.\\\\n33. To make the output, you have to flip the input grid both  horizontally and vertically, and place all four copies side by side without any gap in between them, in such a way that the original grid is at the top left, its horizontal flip at top right, its vertical flip at bottom left and the horizontal and vertical flip at bottom right. Essentially the image is mirrored against both axes.\\\\n34. To make the output, you have to reflect the input grid across both horizontal and vertical axis. The reflection should be along the center line of the input grid which creates four identical quadrants. This results in a repetition of the numbers both in the columns and rows in the output grid.\\\\n35. To make the output, replicate the 3x3 grid and put it next to itself (to the right). Then copy that row of 6 and paste it below itself and then do the same process once more. The output would then be the same 3x3 grid ordered in 4 quadrants of a 6x6 grid.\\\\n36. To make the output, you have to reflect the original 3x3 grid along both vertical and horizontal axes. This will result in vertical and horizontal mirror images of the original grid appearing on its right and bottom to form a 6x6 grid.\\\\n37. To create the output, you need to replicate the input grid in a diagonal symmetry. The output results in two diagonally mirrored pairs of the original 3x3 grid forming a 6x6 grid.\\\\n38. To make the output, you have to mirror the input grid both horizontally and vertically to fill the 6x6 output grid. The center 2x2 square of the output grid is equal to the center of the input, repeated. The rest of the output grid mirrors the input around this central square.\\\\n39. To make the output, you have to first create a mirrored version of the original grid horizontally and attach it to the right side of the original grid. Then create a mirrored version of this new expanded grid vertically and attach it to the bottom of the expanded grid.\\\\n40. To reach the output from the input, the 3x3 grid should be mapped into a 6x6 grid by reflecting entire shape both horizontally and vertically. This creates a symmetry or reflection pattern where the bottom half is a reflection of the top half and the right half is a reflection of the left half.\\\\n41. The transformation pattern involves reflecting the contents of the original 3x3 grid over both the x and y-axes. This results in the original 3x3 grid appearing in each of the 4 corners of the output, orientated in the same way.\\\\n42. To make the output, you have to reflect the 3x3 grid both horizontally and vertically. The result is a 6x6 grid, which is symmetric both vertically and horizontally.\\\\n43. To make the output, imagine that the original 3x3 square is reflected along the both main diagonals. This mirrored square is then placed next to the original one to form a 6x6 grid.\\\\n44. To make the output, you have to reflect the input grid horizontally and vertically, thus obtaining a 6x6 grid where each color is reflected along the central rows and columns.\\\\n45. To create the output grid, reflect the entire input matrix first about its vertical axis, then combine. Reflect this combined matrix about its horizontal axis and then combine. The reflection here means mirroring the image on one side over to the other side.\\\\n46. To make the output, you have to mirror the input grid both vertically and horizontally. This results in a 6x6 grid where the original 3x3 grid is reflected across both the vertical and horizontal center axes.\\\\n47. To create the output, you would need to reflect the input grid vertically and horizontally around the central cell to create a 6x6 grid. This creates a larger grid that appears to be mirrored along both the middle row and middle column.\\\\n48. To make the output, you need to make a mirror image of the input grid both horizontally and vertically. The middle row and column must be duplicated in the process.\\\\n49. To make the output, the input grid should be mirrored both horizontally and vertically to create a 6x6 grid. The 3x3 input is reflected across the central row and column to fill in the remaining positions of the output grid.\\\\n50. To make the output, you have to mirror the input grid about both the vertical and horizontal axes. The center of this mirror operation is the center of the 3x3 grid i.e you copy the cell values into its mirrored position, thus creating a 6x6 symmetric grid. All cells in the 6x6 grid that are mirror images of each other across the center get the same color as in 3x3 grid.\\\\n51. To make the output, you have to mirror in two directions (vertically and horizontally) to fill a 6x6 grid. The input grid is placed to the top left corner of the output, and then it is mirrored to the right, down and diagonally down-right.\\\\n52. To make the output, take the input and replicate it to fill up the 6x6 grid, but mirror it about both vertical and horizontal axis. This is to say, the first row of the input becomes the first and last rows of the output, the second row of the input becomes the second and fifth rows of the output, and the third row of the input becomes the third and fourth rows of the output; similarly for the columns.\\\\n53. To make the output, you have to reflect the input grid both horizontally and vertically (forming a mirror image), ensuring that the central square is common to all quadrants.\\\\n54. To make the output, you have to create first two reflection patterns. The first reflection is along the vertical central line and the second reflection is along the horizontal central line. This mirrors the original 3x3 input across two axes, creating a symmetrical 6x6 output.\\\\n55. To make the output, the input grid is first reflected both horizontally and vertically to make a 6x6 grid. This reflection is basically copying and flipping the input grid in both directions.\\\\n56. To make the output, you have to reflect the input grid both horizontally and vertically. This means that the centre column and the centre row is the mirror lines, the cells across this line should be a mirror image of the cells on the other side.\\\\n57. To make the output, you have to reflect the input grid vertically and horizontally. The output then is the input grid filled out such that it is mirrored along its center row and column, effectively producing a 6x6 grid from the 3x3 input. This can be thought of as a reflection and scaling operation.\\\\n58. To make the output, you have to rotate the input grid 180 degrees around the center point, then append the rotated grid at the right and bottom of the original grid, effectively creating a mirror image along the main diagonal.\\\\n59. To make the output, you have to reflect the input horizontally and vertically. Consider it as if you placed a mirror at the rightmost column and the bottom row of the input, and the colors reflected onto the other side, coupling the original and its reflection.\\\\n60. To make the output, two operations have been done. First, the input was mirrored across its vertical axis. After the reflection, a mirror effect was also applied across its horizontal axis. As a result, each quad in the output is a copy of the input.\\\\n61. To make the output, expand the 3x3 input grid to a mirror image in both the x and y direction to make a 6x6 grid. The pattern should repeat itself both horizontally and vertically.\\\\n62.

For each category, synthesize the rules into a single, specific rule that combines the ideas of all rules in that category, while clearly differentiating it from the other categories.\\\\nThe new rule should be as specific as possible, following the format of the given rules.\\\\nThe new rule should be applicable without any information from the original rules - i.e. it should be standalone.\\\\n\\\\nRules:\\\\n1. To make the output, transform the right bottom corner color (if there\u2019s no color in the bottom corner, then leave the corresponding box in the output grid as black) then transform the color that forms a right-angled shape (if there\u2019s no right-angled color shape then leave it black in the output grid if not filled up with the bottom corner color). The colors in the output should be in the same orientation as they were in the input.\\\\n2. To make the output, you have to compress the input into a 3x3 grid. The color of each cell in the output grid is determined by the corresponding 3x3 area in the input grid. If the 3x3 area in the input grid contains cells of only one color, the corresponding cell in the output grid should be of that color. If the 3x3 area in the input grid contains cells of more than one color, the corresponding cell in the output grid should be of the color that appears more often in the 3x3 area in the input grid. In case of an equal number of cells of two different colors, the color of the corresponding cell in the output grid should be determined by the position of the colors in the 3x3 area in the input grid: if the color in the top left position appears equally often as the other color, the corresponding cell in the output grid should be of that color.\\\\n3. To make the output, you have to place the two colored shapes (which are in the input grid) into the 3x3 output grid. The top shape gets placed in the top and bottom rows and the left column of the output grid. The bottom shape gets placed in the right column and center cell of the output grid.\\\\n4. To make the output, you have to take the non-black cells from the top-left and bottom-right corners. Arrange the colors in a 3x3 grid where left column comes from top left corner of input, middle column comes from the center of both corners and right column comes from bottom right corner of input. In this way, we have a 3x3 output corresponding to the corners of the input grid.\\\\n5. To make the output, you have to find the positions of the colored symbols on the input grid and redraw them proportionally on a 3x3 grid. Also, the overlapping areas should be filled with the color of the symbol that appears later on the grid from top to bottom.\\\\n6. To create the output grid, you have to identify the colors of the two shapes, and place them respectively in the 3x3 grid maintaining the same layout shape but reduced in size. The leftmost color shape goes to the bottom row of the output and the rightmost color shape goes to the left row of the output. The common cell at the 2nd row and 2nd column of the output grid takes the color of the rightmost color shape.\\\\n7. To get the output from the input, you have to create a 3x3 grid, where the top left cell corresponds to the color of the rightmost cell of the first row from top of each shape. Take the middle cell from rightmost column from both shapes for middle cell of output. Similarly, fill the rest of the output grid. The bottom right 3x3 square is filled by taking the bottom left L shape, and the top left 3x3 square is filled by taking the top right 3x3 square from the input.\\\\n8. To make the output, you have to reduce the size of the input grid keeping the same colored cells\\\\\\' configuration. Each colored cell in the input grid takes up 3x3 in the output grid. Hence, the top left corner of the output will correspond to spots taken by the first color in the input and bottom right corner of the output will correspond to the spots taken by the second color in the input. Every other location in the output grid will correspond to a black cell if it doesn\\\\\\'t replace a colored cell in the input grid.\\\\n9. To make the output, you have to reduce the size of the input grid. The top left color of the triangle located on the left side of the input grid becomes the left column of the output grid. The top side of the triangle located on the right side of the input grid becomes the bottom row of the output grid. The center of the output grid is filled with the color located on the bottom tip of the left triangle.\\\\n10. To make the output, you have to condense the colored patterns from the input into less spaced form. Each colored pattern forms a 3 x 3 grid within the 10x10 grid. Firstly identify the colored pattern on the top left and fill the output 3x3 grid from left to right, top to bottom. Repeat the same action for the colored pattern at the bottom right of the input grid. If a certain cell in the output grid has more than one color mapped from the input grid, the last mapped color is maintained.\\\\n11. To make the output, you have to condense the colored sections into 3x3 grids. The first cell in the first row and column of the colored section is placed in the first cell of the new grid, the second cell of the colored section to the second cell in the new grid and so on. The relative positions of the colored cells are maintained in the output. If an L shape is mirrored in the input, it remains mirrored in the output and vice versa.\\\\n12. For transformation, you firstly need to locate two different shapes (in different colors) in the input grid. The first shape is a kind of staircase in one color located at the top left of the grid and the other shape is a block of the same size (3X3 square) in another color located at the bottom right of the grid. Now, create a new 3X3 grid where the block\\\\\\'s uppermost row becomes the bottom row of the new grid and the two bottommost rows of the staircase become the top two rows of the new grid. Continuity of the block\\\\\\'s cells (the same color) and the staircase\\\\\\'s cells will have to be maintained in the new grid.\\\\n13. To make the output, you have to concentrate the two separate coloured sections into a 3x3 grid by moving them together. The top left color from the input becomes the left column, and the bottom right color becomes the top row.\\\\n14. To make the output, you have to take the top left 3x3 quadrant and mirror it to make the bottom right 3x3 quadrant for the output. The rule applies even if the top left 3x3 contains only black cells.\\\\n15. To make the output, you have to compress the shapes to fit the 3x3 grid. The largest shape retains its color and fills up the lower area of the grid. The smaller shape retains its color and is placed above the larger one, aligned to the left. The remaining cells should be filled with the color of the smaller shape.\\\\n16. To make the output, you have to rotate the top color square by 90 degrees clockwise and combine it with the bottom color square, using the top square\\\\\\'s color where there\\\\\\'s overlap.\\\\n17. To make the output, you have to .copy the smaller 3x3 grid from the top left corner of the input and place it in the top left corner of the output. Similarly, copy the smaller 3x3 square from the bottom right corner of the input and place it in the bottom right corner of the output.\\\\n18. To make the output, you have to replicate the small squares in the input to fit into a 3x3 scale. The position and the color of the squares must be kept intact in the output. This process can be treated as a pixel-reduction of the input grid to highlight only the main features.\\\\n19. To achieve the output, you\\\\\\'ll need to extract the 3x3 colored area from the input grid. Vertically shrink it. Where you have the congruent cells (top or bottom), transpose the colors from top to bottom, and vice versa.\\\\n20. To make the output, you have to combine the two colored shapes together: the top green part maps to the upper portion of the output and the bottom orange maps to the bottom part of the output. If there is a colored shape in that position in the input, then the output will be the color of that shape (green or orange). The rest output positions will be the color of the other shape. If there is no colored shape in that input position, that output position will be the color that isn\\\\\\'t in the same position.\\\\n21. To transform this grid, identify two shapes in the input grid. These two shapes tend to be located near the top and bottom of the grid respectively. They are grids of 3x3 size. Compile these two shapes together to create a new 3x3 shape. The top-most shape in the input grid forms the two right columns of the output grid and the bottom-most shape in the input grid forms the left-most column of the output grid. Where there are black cells in the original two shapes, they stay black in the output.\\\\n22. The pattern is concentrating each shape into the 3x3 grid. The bottom most and rightmost 3 cells of the first shape and topmost 3 cells of the second shape are combined in top to bottom order to form the output 3x3 grid.\\\\n23. To make the output, you have to extract the colored 3x3 squares from the input and stack them on top of each other. The top half 3x3 square is the top of the output and the bottom half square is the bottom of the output.\\\\n24. To make the output, you have to:  1. Identify the color figures that are located in the corners of the grid. These will be compact figures that consist of colored, non-zero cells.  2. Extract 3 cells from each figure (top left, top right and left bottom cell of each figure).  3. Place them in the corresponding corner of a new 3x3 grid. The upper left figure\\\\\\'s cells goes to the upper left corner, and so on. Mind the order of cells: top left of a figure goes to top of a new figure etc.  4. This process results in a 3x3 grid with colored figures in each corner, each figure consists of 3 colored cells. The center of the grid remains black.\\\\n25. First, spot the two small squares (top and bottom, 3x3 and not entirely black) in the input grid, then superimpose them into a single 3x3 grid (output). If there\\\\\\'s a coloured cell at the same location in both of the small squares, it gets the colour of the bottom square. If only one of the squares has a colour at a location, it takes that colour.\\\\n26. The areas separated by black grid is transformed into a single 3x3 grid in the output. The upper color in the input grid is taken first and then followed by the lower color. The transformation involves color transfers as per the input grids but the black grids are ignored and their places are taken up by respective colors.\\\\n27. The output grid consists of the a reduced form of the two images in the input. Each figure (represented by a distinct color) in the input grid is scaled down to 1/3rd of its size in both dimensions, and the two are overlaid onto each other such that the bottom color overlaps the top color where they coincide. In the places they overlap, the bottom color is dominant.\\\\n28. The transformation process involves collapsing the figures found in each quadrant of the input grid into one single output quadrant. Starting with the upper-left quadrant, any present figure is mirrored into the lower-right quadrant of the output. Similarly, the lower-right figure of the input is mirrored into the upper-left quadrant of the output. Lastly, the figure found in the middle of the input grid is relocated to the middle of the output. The empty cells within the figures in the input are also mirrored into the output.\\\\n29. The transformation involves finding the clusters of colored blocks in the input grid and aligning them inside the output grid. The images of colored blocks are horizontally flipped and then superimposed over each other. If two colored blocks overlap, the color of the block in the original bottom cluster is kept. If a single block is found in a position, the color of that block is kept. If no blocks are found, the square is colored black.\\\\n30. To make the output, you have to make a 3x3 grid where the color pattern of both regions are merged. If there is no intersecting color for a particular position between the two patterns fill that position with the color of the first pattern. The top part of first pattern is merged with the bottom part of the second pattern and if they both have color, the color of second pattern is kept in the output.\\\\n31. To make the output, you have to rotate the two different colored 3x3 squares and overlap them on their same orientation but different location. If a cell is colored in both squares, use the color of the square on the lower half of the input. If a cell is colored in one square only, use the color of that square. If a cell is blank in both squares, output a blank cell.\\\\n32. To make the output, you have to take the 3x3 colored shapes from the input grid, where colors are anything except black, and place them on a new 3x3 grid. The colors or shapes do not change. Position the top one on the top and the bottom one on the bottom. If there\\\\\\'s only one 3x3 colored shape, place it on the bottom of the output 3x3 grid.\\\\n33. To make the output, we\\\\\\'ll need to compress both the top and the bottom colored shapes within the 3x3 grid output. The color that appears first from top to bottom in the input should occupy the first row in the output. If the colour changes within the group, the new colour should continue filling the rest of the row, and if there\\\\\\'s still space, it should spill over to the next row. The same applies to the gap which should be represented by black cells in the output and finally the bottom color.   In a nutshell, the transformation can be perceived as a vertical split and squeeze of the color groups. This way, the vertical distribution and color sequence are maintained while the shapes and horizontal distribution are lost in the output.\\\\n34. To make the output grid, first identify the colored shapes in the input grid. The shapes can be any color other than black. Then, you need to mirror the position of the shape in the output grid.  For example, if the green-colored shape is located at the top left corner in the input grid, you will put a green-colored cell at the top left corner of the output grid. Likewise, if a blue-colored shape is located at the bottom right of the input grid, place the blue colored cell at the bottom right of the output grid. Do this for all cells of the shape (not just the first one you find).   If a cell of the second shape is in the same position as a cell of the first shape, overwrite it. If a cell in the output grid doesn\\\\\\'t correspond to a cell in either shape, leave it as black.\\\\n35. To make the output, you have to downscale each colored shape. Each shape in the input grid is downscaled to just three cells in the output grid. If the shape in the input grid has 1 cell, make the one in the center of output grid the same color as the input shape. If the shape in the input grid has 2 cells, make the two cells on the left side of output grid the same color as the input shape. If the shape in the input grid has 3 cells, make the whole first row of the output grid the same color as the input shape. Do these steps for both the upper and the lower shape, placing the downscaled upper shape on the top row, and the lower shape on the bottom row. The middle row on output grid should have the same cells as the last row of the downscaled upper shape and first row of the downscaled lower shape.\\\\n36. To make the output, you have to recreate the two original squares in the center of a 3x3 grid, where the top pixels are formed from the bottom color shape in the input, and the bottom pixels are from the top color shape in the input. Each colored square in the output is a 2x2 square positioned in its corresponding quadrant.\\\\n37. The pattern involves rotation and translation of the shapes. The task is to locate the shapes in the grid, rotate them 90 degrees counter-clockwise, then map them into new 3x3 grid based on their new position. The shape that was originally placed near the top-left corner of the input grid ends up in the bottom-left corner of the output grid, and the shape that was originally placed near the bottom-right corner of the input grid ends up in the top-right corner of the output grid.\\\\n38. To make the output, you first, identify the two squares in the input grid, then you\\\\\\'ll need to vertically flip the square from the left bottom corner and horizontally flip the square from the right top corner. Finally, you combine the two flipped squares into a single 3x3 grid so that the first square occupies the left part of the grid and the other occupies the right part of the grid. If there is any overlapping, the overlapping parts are filled with the color which occurs last in the pattern.\\\\n39. To make the output, identify the colored shapes in the input grid, each shape being a connected set of squares of the same color (vertically, horizontally or diagonally). If there are two shapes, place the leftmost, topmost cell of each shape in the grid such that the shape originating from the top row is placed at the top and the one originating from the bottom row is at the bottom. If there is a single cell shape, consider that as the topmost cell and place it in the center of the top row of the output grid. Repeat this pattern for subsequent rows in the output grid. Fill in the rest of the grid by taking the color of the majority of cells directly to the right and below the populated cell in the input grid. If there is a tie in the majority color, use the right cell\\\\\\'s color.\\\\n40. To make the output, you have to take the coloured shape from top and bottom, then you shrink down the shape by taking the middle column of the shape at the top and bottom and combine it into a 3x3 grid, thereby forming the output. The middle of the output grid becomes the colour where ever there was overlap between the top and bottom shape.\\\\n41. To make the output, you should enclose the two colorful patterns into a new 3x3 grid. Then, reflect each cell of these two patterns into the 3x3 grid according to this rule: if the cell is black in the input grid, it stays black in the output grid, otherwise, the color of the cell in the output grid is the color of the cell from the input grid which would be at this position if we folded the 3x3 output grid along the diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left).\\\\n42. To make the output, you have to find the top-left non-black pixel in the input and consider it as the top-left corner of a 3x3 region. Copy this 3x3 region from the input to the output grid. In the cases when the shape doesn\\\\\\'t form a perfect 3x3 area, extend it with black cells to form a 3x3 area.   For example, in Case 0 the non-black pixels in the input make a \\\\\\'L\\\\\\'-shaped pattern. The top-left green pixel in this \\\\\\'L\\\\\\' serves as the starting point of copying a 9-cell region to the output, resulting in only green and black cells. However, when interpreting the orange pixels forming another \\\\\\'L\\\\\\' (mirrored), it\\\\\\'s important to ensure that even though the pattern is incomplete as a 3x3 square, it\\\\\\'s extended with black cells to form a 3x3 area in the output. Hence, the original green \\\\\\'L\\\\\\' and the partially black \\\\\\'L\\\\\\' with orange cells combine to form the 3x3 output.   This rule applies to all other cases.\\\\n43. To make the output, you have to find the boxes within the input grid and add them to the output grid in their relative positions. If a box on the input grid is colored on the outside and black in the middle, maintain this format in the output grid. If a box on the input grid is completely colored, make it completely colored in the output grid as well.\\\\n44. To transform the grid, locate the two colored areas within the grid. Each area will represent a 3x3 square in the output. The area on the top should be placed on the bottom of the output, in the same pattern. Similarly, the area on the bottom of the input grid should be placed at the top of the output, in the same pattern. Any coloured area in the input grid larger than a 3x3 square will be reduced to a 3x3 square in the output by removing outer cells. This is sort of like getting a 3x3 \"snapshot\" or \"cropped image\" from the center of the large colored objects from the input grid. If the colored image is less than a 3x3 grid, occupy the center of the 3x3 grid in output and fill the rest with black cells.\\\\n45. To make the output, you have to select the 3x3 block of colored boxes at the top center and the one at the bottom left of the grid and then copy the contents of the top centered 3x3 block, rotating it 180 degrees, to the bottom left 3x3 block replacing the existing elements there. This combined 3x3 block (rotated top center block into bottom left block) will give the output.\\\\n46. To make the output, you have to shrink the grid while maintaining the color information. The first row and column of output is made from the column and row that forms the base of \\\\\\'1\\\\\\' for the first column and row respectively. The middle row and column of output is made from the middle row and column of the \\\\\\'1\\\\\\' and \\\\\\'7\\\\\\'. The last row and column of output is made from the row and column that forms the base of \\\\\\'7\\\\\\' for the last column and row respectively. Ignore the black boxes during this conversion.\\\\n47. The rule involves creating a 3x3 grid from the two clusters by aligning the top left corner of each cluster with the corresponding position in the output grid. If the top left of the first cluster is at the top left of the input, its corresponding position will be the top left of the output. The first cluster fills in from the top left of the output and the second fills in from the bottom right of the output. The output grid is filled in a top-to-bottom, left-to-right order. If the two clusters overlap in the output the first cluster takes precedence.\\\\n48. To make the output, you have to first locate the first non-black pixel in each row from the top and the first non-black pixel in each row from the bottom. You then need to create a 3x3 grid which mimics the pixels of these topmost and bottommost colored objects. The topmost colored shape will be reflected to the bottom of the output grid and the bottommost colored shape will be mirrored to the top. The middle row of the output grid will then be the combination of the middle row of both shapes, where the left half is taken from the topmost shape and the right half is taken from the bottommost shape in the input grid.\\\\n49. To make the output, you have to identify colored shapes in the large grid and shrink them to fit in the 3x3 grid. If the boxes contain a color, that color goes in the corresponding location in the output grid. If the boxes are empty (colored black), fill in the corresponding location in the output grid with the color that appears most in the same column in the input grid.\\\\n50. The transformation involves merging and re-ordering the colored rectangles from the big grid in the smaller output grid. First, take the top left 3x3 colored rectangle from the input grid. If it\\\\\\'s a 2x3, fill the third column of the output with the color of the rectangle on the lower portion of the input grid. For the two remaining rectangles, rotate them 90 degrees counterclockwise and move them to the center and right-most column of the output grid respectively. If a 2x3 rectangle was initially at the top-left of the input grid, then the 1x3 portion, after rotation, should be put in the lower part of the respective column in the output grid.\\\\n51. To transform input to output, you have to rotate the whole grid 90 degrees to the right and then cast it into 3x3 grid by compressing all identical (matching) columns and rows into single column or row, while keeping the colored boxes.\\\\n52. To make the output, firstly you need to locate the two colored squares in the input grid. Then replace each row of the first colored square (upper left) with the corresponding row of the second colored square (lower right) if it exists. Replace any missing rows of the first colored square with the last present row of the second colored square. The result may be a square where each row is a color.\\\\n53. To make the output, you have to locate the two colorful shapes and reposition them into the output 3x3 grid. The first shape located in the upper-left corner in the input grid should be placed starting from the lower-left corner in the output grid. It should be filled from bottom to top and from left to right. The second shape located in the lower-right corner in the input grid should be placed starting from the upper-right corner in the output grid. It should also be filled from bottom to top and from left to right. Any remaining cells in the 3x3 output grid should be filled with black cells.\\\\n54. To make the output, you have to transform both color formations into 3x3 squares, placing the top formation on the top of the output, and the bottom formation on the bottom of the output. If there are less than 3 rows of a formation, fill the rows with the color of the formation\\\\\\'s last row until there are 3 rows. If there are more than 3 rows, reduce them to 3 by taking the first, second and last line of the formation. If one of the squares does not have a color in the input grid, color it with the color of the square directly above from the same formation.\\\\n55. To make the output, you have to identify the first 3x3 square in the input. Continue searching until you find another 3x3 square, and then merge these two squares together. For each cell in the output grid, if the cell comprises two different colors in the input, takes the color of the lower square. If the cell consists only one color (not black), takes the color of that cell regardless of the square it belongs to. For black cells in the input, the corresponding cells in the output remain black.\\\\n56. To make the output grid, you have to identify the colored objects\\\\\\' location and then upscale them. The upscaling retains the shape of the colored object. The colored object in the first quadrant of the input grid (top left side) maps to the first quadrant of the output grid, and similarly for the second (top right), third (bottom left), fourth (bottom right) quadrants. If there is no colored object in a quadrant of the input grid, that quadrant of the output grid remains black.\\\\n57. To provide an output, you need to shrink each input grid to a size of 3x3, with three similar-colored squares in each corner corresponding to the similar colors in the input grid. Preserve the internal structure of the colors while shrinking. For instance, a green square in the center of the green area in the input should still be at the center of the green area in the output.\\\\n58. To create the output, you need to condense the two shapes into the 3x3 grid. The top color takes the left column and the middle cell, while the bottom color takes the right column and the middle cell. If there is a black cell in the original shape, it also remains black in the 3x3 grid.\\\\n59. The transformation involves identifying the small coloured figures within the input grid and overlapping them onto each other in the respective positions within the 3x3 output grid. If there\\\\\\'s a conflict of colours between the small figures while overlapping, the colour of the figure in the lower half of the input grid takes precedence.\\\\n60. To make the output, you have to trace and copy the shape (straight line or L-shaped line) within the input grid and place it in the output grid. Place the top shape at the bottom of the output grid and the bottom shape at the top of the output grid. If there\\\\\\'s no colored square, fill it black.\\\\n61. To make the output, you need to identify the three-colored sections in the input, scale them down to their 3x3 equivalents, and place them in the same relative positions in the output grid. Each color section should keep its original orientation during transformation.\\\\n62. To make the output, you have to align the two shapes from the input on top of each other, to form a new 3x3 grid. If both cells have a color, keep the color of the bottom shape. If only one cell has a color, fill the corresponding cell in the output grid with that color. If both input cells are black, fill the corresponding cell in the output grid with black too.\\\\n63. To make the output, you should look at the 3x3 section of the colored blocks in the top left part of the grid and map those colors and positions to the output. The top row should come from the top colored block in the input, the middle row should come from the middle of the top colored block in the input, and the bottom row should come from the bottom of the top colored block from the input.\\\\n64. To make the output, locate two distinct shapes/block in the input grid. The first shape is located in the first half of the input grid and the second shape can be found in the second half of the input grid. Get the 3x3 grid representation of each shape from top to bottom and merge them to form a 3x3 output grid. Should a shape not be able to complete a 3x3 grid, fill the remaining space with the color of the other shape.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "After analyzing the rules, they can be categorized into eight distinct categories based on their similarities:\n\n1.

For the transformation from the input to output grid, the grey cells within the red squares are mirrored along the vertical axis of the square. The grey cells that are not within the squares remain the same. The red squares and the rest of the grid remain unchanged.\\\\n2. To transform the input into the output, you should shift gray cells so that they are surrounded by red cells that are horizontally and vertically adjacent to them. If there are no horizontally and vertically adjacent red cells, don\\\\\\'t shift the gray cell. Keep the remaining cells (black or red) as they are. The gray cells are moved to the cells that previously contained red cells.\\\\n3. To make the output, you have to mirror-copy the grey cells along the central row. Basically, you need to place a mirror on the central row of each red object and reflect the position of a grey cell over it.\\\\n4. To make the output, you would first notice the two red squares in the centre of the grid and the formation/s that are made up of grey squares around the red squares. You then take these grey square formations and place it symmetrically around the red square formations like a mirror.   Note: If the grey square formation consists of a square then that square becomes a rectangle consisting of 5 grey squares (the extra square is at the top or at the bottom) and is placed symmetrically around the red square formation like a mirror. The entire square or rectangle of the grey square formation is mirrored symmetrically around the median of the red square formation. The rest of the grid is black.\\\\n5. To make the output, you have to compact the grey blocks into the center. The pattern always stays in front of the central column of black blocks, and around the two side red blocks. There should always be two consecutive grey blocks in the middle. If there were four grey blocks above or below the pattern, compact them to two with the same positioning as the middle ones, but on the outside of the red blocks. All the other cells should turn into black cells.\\\\n6. To make the output, you have to re-shape the design so that the markings inside the arrow are symmetrical both horizontally and vertically. The grey markings should appear as an X pattern inside the arrow. The rest of the cells should remain black.\\\\n7. To make the output, you have to visually flip the upside-down \\\\\\'U\\\\\\' shape to a right-side-up \\\\\\'U\\\\\\' or \\\\\\'n\\\\\\' shape, maintaining the colors. The grey cells that were on the top of the \\\\\\'n\\\\\\' shape should now be on the bottom of the \\\\\\'U\\\\\\' shape, and vice versa. All other cells should remain black.\\\\n8. The transformation pattern here, focuses on the center of the heart, both top and bottom. The colour dots (5) that appear distributed over the heart in the input, are rearranged in the output so that they sit in the center columns of the heart shape, in the same rows they were originally in the input. The rest of the input is copied exactly as is to the output.\\\\n9. To get the output, remove the grey color from the outside of the hourglass and ensure the interior part of the hourglass contained only a diamond-shaped pattern of greys. The diamond shape is started from the middle column and followed by alternating grey and empty rows towards the upper and lower part of the hourglass.\\\\n10. To make the output, you need to take the image and rotate it 90 degrees to the right. The grey color rows on the top and bottom are now on the right and left sides in the output grid, and the red color pattern turns from being vertical to horizontal.\\\\n11. To make the output grid, the grey icons should be left as they are. The white icons in the central area of the grey icons should be mirrored along the middle horizontal line inside the grey icons. This way, the part of the white icon above the middle line copies onto the part below the line, and the part below the line vanishes and turns black.\\\\n12. To make the output, you have to first locate all the connected grey cells in the input and identify them as a group. Then, find the central cell of this group, if the group of grey cells is even then the central cell is one of the two middle cells closer to the top of the grid. Replace the group of grey cells starting from the central cell outwards with grey cells in a cross shape (up, down, left, and right cells from the center). The rest of the grey cells should be turned into black cells. The red cells remain the same and their position does not change.\\\\n13. To make the output, you have to mirror the red and grey symbols along their vertical lines of symmetry. For grey, each point is simply reflected across the vertical middle, as if flip the grey side across the vertical axis that running from the original grey symbol to the reflected grey symbol. The red symbols are mirrored inside their rectangles, i.e, red symbols at right side are reflected at left and those at left are reflected at right. The black cells remain the same.\\\\n14. To make the output, you have to maintain the \\\\\\'red\\\\\\' lines as they are in the input and mirror the \\\\\\'grey\\\\\\' pattern only with respect to the center of the \\\\\\'red\\\\\\' rectangle, not the entire 15x15 grid. The \\\\\\'grey\\\\\\' pattern, when mirrored within the defined structure, resembles \\\\\\'grey\\\\\\' eyes encapsulated in a \\\\\\'red\\\\\\' mask.\\\\n15. To make the output, you have to shift the concentration of grey cells towards the center. In case of even number of grey cells, distribute them equally on both sides of the center. If there is an odd number of grey cells, let the center one stay in the same position while the remaining ones distribute equally with one part on the left side of the center and the other on the right side. Leave other cells unchanged.\\\\n16. To make the output, the red squares should remain in place, but the grey clusters should be moved to the center of the red squares they are surrounding. If there are multiple grey clusters surrounding a single red square, then they should all be gathered towards that center. All the rest of the cells should remain black.\\\\n17. To transform the input grid to the output grid, find the most left and most right grey box within the red horizontal line. Then draw a vertical line crossing the red line at the position of most left and most right grey box, but only inside the horizontal red lines and put a grey box at the intersection. Replace all grey boxes outside these newly drawn vertical lines with black boxes.\\\\n18. To transform the input to the output, you must switch the positions of the gray cells within the red square at each line. The gray cells on the left side of the grid should be moved to the center position of the red square and the ones on the right side to the next position to the center. The gray cells in the center should be moved to the outer parts of the red square. The red squares remain in the same spots.\\\\n19. To make the output, you have to move all gray squares to the red line at the same column. If there are more than one gray square in the same column, stack them on top of each other along the red line. The rest of the grid should be black.\\\\n20. To make the output, you have to mirror the grey squares along the vertical axis, while red squares and black squares remain the same.\\\\n21. To make the output, you have to maintain the position of the rectangle formed by the red boxes (number 2) but adjust the positions of the gray boxes (number 5). Place the gray boxes (number 5) symmetrically around the vertical centerline of the rectangle \u2013 two gray boxes placed on the vertical centerline of the rectangle, with one arranged above and one below the rectangle and the remaining gray boxes arranged on the second horizontal line of the rectangle from the top and bottom edges.\\\\n22. To make the output, you have to observe the middle part of the input containing colored boxes. Remove the green boxes that are not filled or surrounded by other green boxes. Only green boxes that form continuous horizontal lines will remain. The red boxes maintain their positions. The output grid will still have the same top and bottom part as the input, entirely black.\\\\n23. To make the output, you have to remove all the grey cells that are located at the border of these symbols and are not surrounded by other grey cells from all sides except the side facing the inside of the symbol. After that, all the grey cells that are inside the symbol are removed. The rest of the grid remains the same with all the black and red cells keeping their position.\\\\n24. To form the output, perform the following operations:  1. Remove the grey squares and fill their places with black color. 2. For the red H-shaped figures, fill them with more red color to make them thicker. If a grey square was part of the H-shaped figure, replace it with the red color.  Essentially, this transformation involves \"thickening\" the red H-shaped figures and \"erasing\" the grey squares.\\\\n25. To make the output, you have to shift grey squares along the central vertical axis of the grid while preserving the pattern. The red squares remain in their initial positions. Grey squares that go beyond the central vertical line are removed from the grid.\\\\n26. To make the output, you have to rotate the grey bar by 90 degrees clockwise within the red diamond. If the grey bar is horizontal originally, rotate it to vertical and vice versa. After rotation, maintain the diamond\\\\\\'s symmetry accordingly with grey square(s) at the middle column or row. The grey square(s) on the ends of the bar should be removed. Other cells remain unchanged.\\\\n27. In the pattern, we can observe that the red (\\\\\\'2\\\\\\') shapes remain the same. The grey (\\\\\\'5\\\\\\') line pattern is changed in a way that maintains its horizontal reflection symmetry. Here is the rule for transforming the grey dot -  1. Replace the grey dot in the top row of the red square with the one in the fifth spot of the grey pattern. 2. Replace the grey dots in the middle row of the red square with the second and fourth spots of the grey pattern. 3. Replace the grey dot in the bottom row of the red square with the one in the third spot of the grey pattern. 4. Keep the remaining cells black (\\\\\\'0\\\\\\'). This operation essentially centralizes the grey line pattern inside the red square making it symmetrical.\\\\n28. To transform the input into the output, shift the grey blocks towards the central horizontal line, creating a symmetrical shape around this line. The blocks on each side of the red lines should line up to form one continuous line. All blocks above the top red line and below the bottom red line must be omitted.\\\\n29. To make the output, you have to mirror the squares on the left side of the crossed grey lines to the right side. If there is a colored square on the left side of the line, put a colored square on the same position on the right side of the line and vice versa. If there is a black square, leave it black. Do this for the squares that are above and beneath the lines too.\\\\n30. The pattern entails transforming the gray boxes in the input grid into red rectangles of the same size in the output grid. However, the gray boxes in the output grid should be positioned in the central vertical line of the red rectangles in the input grid. The red rectangles in the input grid should be maintained in the output grid in their original positions. The black colored cells in the input grid should be maintained in the output grid.\\\\n31. To make the output, you have to mirror the shape of the grey color in vertical and horizontal pair patterns within the boundary set out by the red color. Place the first mirrored grey color pattern directly in the center of the boundary, and then place subsequent mirrored patterns in a spiral motion starting from the center to the outside.\\\\n32. To make the output, look at the rows with the grey squares. Shift the teal squares so that they are in the middle of the red square, essentially mirroring the placement from around the outside to the inside. Rows that do not contain any red square should be left unchanged. All black squares remain black.\\\\n33. The transformation seems to focus on the grey parts of the grid. It appears that those parts which are connected or adjacent are filled/colored in the output. Moreover, it seems to fill centrally as the perimeter maintains its original color from the input grid. So, to transform the grid, focus on finding and filling in these connected or adjacent grey parts, leaving the perimeter intact.\\\\n34. To obtain the output grid, you should move each green cell to the middle of closest red pattern ensuring that each of the vertical lines is balanced and centered with the same amount of green cells, preserving the original structure of empty cells and red cells.\\\\n35. To make the output, it appears the picture is being mirrored horizontally, from the center line. Then a 3 wide mirror on the center line and two mirroring boxes are made gray, indeed all red 2 squares are made gray. The ones (once colored squares) not affected by the other transformation are flipped horizontally around the center axes. Only gray and red are used, black squares remain the same.\\\\n36. To make the output, let first look on blue squares 5 surrounded by red squares 2. Whenever a blue square is surrounded by red squares vertically, the square beneath it also turns blue. Continue this until there are no red squares underneath it. If a blue square is not surrounded by red squares, it turns black. After following these steps, the shapes formed by red squares will remain the same. The grid outside these shapes will stay black.\\\\n37. The transformation moves the grey shapes vertically so they occupy the center of the grid, preserving their alignment and structure. The blue cells within the shapes are arranged in a symmetrical pattern along the vertical axis within the shapes.\\\\n38. To make the output, first, locate the central rectangle. Then, there is a conversion rule for every cell of the grids. Keep all the cells outside of the rectangles as it is. Inside the rectangle, convert all black cells to the grey, if they\\\\\\'re located at the red cells\\\\\\' position from the other rectangle. Specifically, for each grey cell in the column, check the corresponding cell in both patterns of red and black cells. If the corresponding cell in one pattern is red and the cell in the other pattern is black, then the cell in the output grid should be grey. In other cases, the cell remains as it is.\\\\n39. To make the output, you have to retain only the colored shape patterns that are made of red blocks and for the grey shapes align it so that it forms a symmetrical pattern around the center line in the location where red shapes exist. This would lead to removal of some of grey blocks and shifting of others to the middle.\\\\n40. To achieve the output, you need to form the same mirrored \"T\" shapes using the red line. However, this time, put a blue square in the rows that contain the stem of the \"T\" shape. Inside the rectangle formed by the red line, replace every blue square and the other blue square directly opposite to it along the column (regardless of whether it is on the red line or outside it) with an array of blue square all along this line. If the original blue squares are not directly opposite each other, leave them where they were. Replace the rest of squares according to the surrounding depending upon the blue squares while keeping the red line the same.\\\\n41. To make the output, you have to mirror the grey squares horizontally around the center of the grid. The red shapes will stay the same.\\\\n42. To make the output, replace the gray cells inside the arrow with black cells and move the gray cells to middle of arrow symmetrically while preserving their original shape.\\\\n43. To make the output, you have to flip the red arrow vertically around the center of the grid to make it point the opposite direction, and move the gray squares, or not change if the arrow is already placed in the center of the grid. The position of the arrow follows the rule of the arrows in chest game. The upper half is pointing down and the lower half is pointing up. Keep the rest of the grid as it is.\\\\n44. For transforming the input into the output, the grey (5) pixels inside the pattern are manipulated. Some of them are moving towards the center \"column\" of the pattern, creating an effect of concentration. When there\\\\\\'s a choice, the grey pixels prefer to occupy the central row rather than the second and fourth row. The red (2) pixels remain unchanged. The rest part of the grid remains black (0).\\\\n45. To make the output transform the light grey 5s to black 0s if they are not adjacent to any red 2. This transformation effectively leaves a circle of light grey 5s around the red 2s.\\\\n46. To make the output, you have to: 1. Leave all-red rows as they are. 2. Replace the grey boxes in the rows which are not all-red or all-black with an inverted-M symbol replacing grey hollow squares with grey solid squares. 3. Leave all-black rows as they are. This transformation might resemble the idea of a reflection made along the horizontal axis passing through the center of each shape.\\\\n47. To make the output, you have to mirror the inner grey parts of the \"8\" figure in the input grid along a vertical axis in its middle. Other parts of the grid remain the same.\\\\n48. In order to generate the output grid, the rule seems to consist in shifting the gray points shown between the arrow in the input grid into the red squares in the direction pointed by the arrows, thus turning those red squares into grey in the output. The other red squares will remain the same. At the end, all the grey points in the input that are not in between the red squares will be shifted into black squares in the output grid.\\\\n49. To make the output, you can take the parallelogram and square shapes made of the red color in the input, transfer them to the output with their positions unchanged. The two grey colored rectangles are moved inside the red squares at the center of those squares. If the parallelogram in the input is made of two squares, then grid has two squares made by gray color. Then, only one grey square is moved to the center of the upper red square. If the parallelogram in the input is made of a longer line (for example length of 3), then any additional grey squares are moved to the center of the lower red square.\\\\n50. To make the output, you have to redistribute the gray color within the blue figure so that gray appears only along the central horizontal and vertical lines of the figure, thus dividing the blue figure into four segments.\\\\n51. To form the output, you have to locate the red \\\\\\'diamonds\\\\\\' and place the grey cells in a vertical line coming out of the center of the diamond. The grey cells should extend from the top to the bottom of each diamond, following the original placement of grey cells relative to the \\\\\\'diamond\\\\\\'. All other cells remain black.\\\\n52. The transformation can be achieved by re-arranging the grey cells in a different mirror symmetric pattern. Move the grey cells into the red plus shape in a way that they form a diamond shape that is mirror symmetric on both axis. They should be positioned in a way that the red cells they replace are not continuously connected anymore. The areas left empty from moving the grey cells remain black.\\\\n53. The pattern involves replicating the grey squares symmetrically in the spaces between the lines of red squares. In other words, for each grey square found outside the red lines, add a new grey square at the corresponding position inside the red lines so that it is mirrored along the center of the two red lines. All other aspects of the grid should remain unchanged.\\\\n54. To make the output, you have to mirror the shapes symmetrically with respect to the vertical central line (or column) of the grid. But maintain the sequence of the lines as per the original formation.\\\\n55. To make the output, you have to move the grey cells from their positions in the input grid to the positions of the two red cells that are in the center of each arrow. The rest of the grid cells should remain the same in the output as they do in the input.\\\\n56. To form the output, you need to recreate the same grid but shift the gray shapes to the center of the blue shapes they were originally positioned around. If there were multiple gray squares around the blue shape, concentrate all of them in the center.\\\\n57. To make the output grid, you need to maintain the red boundary as is, and shift the gray cells or blocks. The gray blocks that were on top of the red line in the input should move in between the red lines in the output. The arrangement of these gray blocks inside the red boundary becomes symmetrical along the horizontal axis after the transformation, and the blocks inside the top boundary should mirror those inside the bottom boundary. All other cells remain the same.\\\\n58. To make the output: 1. Transfer the blue pattern as it is from the input to the output grid. 2. Then, extract the gray \\\\\\'5\\\\\\'s that are in the pattern of blue \\\\\\'2\\\\\\'s. Meaning that if a gray \\\\\\'5\\\\\\' is inside the shape made by blue \\\\\\'2\\\\\\'s, keep it as it is in the output. 3. If a gray \\\\\\'5\\\\\\' is on the border of blue \\\\\\'2\\\\\\'s, then flip its position with the immediate inner cell. For example, if a gray \\\\\\'5\\\\\\' is surrounded by empty cells and only has one blue \\\\\\'2\\\\\\' as a neighbor, swap the two. 4. All other cells should remain empty (black \\\\\\'0\\\\\\').\\\\n59. To make the output, you have to make some modification in the design part. Gray square remains in the central line of the design but they are mirrored from top to bottom keeping the center line as mirror axis.\\\\n60. To make the output, you have to apply changes to only grey (5) elements from the rectangle. The transformation involves creating a smaller rectangle within the existing grey rectangle by alternating grey and black squares, starting and ending with a grey square on each side. This results in the grey squares forming a closed loop around both black and grey squares. The red (2) elements remain unaffected.   This transformation leads to a result where the shape of the initial grey rectangles is preserved, but it is hollowed out, with half the interior squares filled with the grey color.\\\\n61. To produce the output grid from the input, the gray boxes flanking the red sections need to be moved inside the red segments. Centralize as much as possible the gray boxes within the red sections, ensuring the gray boxes are surrounded by red on the sides. All other area remains as black (empty).\\\\n62. To make the output, you have to perform mirror operation on the grid. The mirrored representation of the face is centralized and symmetrical in the middle of the grid in X and Y axes. Keep the red color parts (eyes and lips) and perform mirror operation to the purple color part (face line) along X axis, that is rotate the top half to bottom and bottom half to top.\\\\n63. To make the output, you have to reposition the grey squares so that they all appear within the red strip. The red strip will remain unchanged. Any grey squares that are vertically adjacent to the red strip should be moved to the row of the strip that is closest to them. Any grey squares that are two or more rows above or below the strip should be moved to the middle row of the strip. The positions of these grey squares along the row should stay the same.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "After analyzing the rules, they can be categorized into eight distinct categories based on their similarities:\n\n1.

For each colored figure in the input: - place the colored figure in the center of the output grid. - create a red border, which involves the filled cells of the figure. - create a brown inverted plus around the figure if it\\\\\\'s a triangle and a red border, which involves the area between the plus tips if the figure is a rectangle. - fill the cells between the red border with the color of the figure. - if there are any cells filled that not belong to the figures or borders, apply the color to them in the output.  Please note that all unmentioned cells in the output should be black.\\\\n2. To make the output, we take the smaller shape formed by the purple squares and embed it within the larger shape formed by the teal squares. Then, take the resulting shape and embed it into the larger shape formed by the red squares. Remove all other black squares to leave only the newly formed shape. The final shape forms a sort of outline or a stencil-like figure.\\\\n3. To make the output, you have to take the smaller blue square and insert it into the hole of the larger red square while scaling them down to half the size. The output results in a larger red square with a smaller blue square in the middle on a black background.\\\\n4. To make the output, you have to replicate the input patterns (the \\\\\\'T\\\\\\' shape and \\\\\\'H\\\\\\' shape) in a smaller 11x11 grid. Replace the black cells with red cells, filling the two shapes and their surrounding spaces. Furthermore, a yellow \\\\\\'H\\\\\\' is placed inside of the original teal \\\\\\'T\\\\\\' and a yellow \\\\\\'T\\\\\\' is placed inside of the original red \\\\\\'H\\\\\\'. All other spaces should be filled with red cells.\\\\n5. To make the output, you have to replace the color of the first square with the color of the second square in the input grid maintaining the exact shape and position. The entire square of the second color in the input grid needs to be replaced with black cells in the output grid. The rest of the grid needs to be filled with red color.\\\\n6. To make the output, you have to combine two figures of the input: teal rectangles from top left area and the central yellow rectangle from bottom right area. Like putting one shape inside the other. The resulting output is a big rectangle (from the teal figure of the input) filled with a small central rectangle (from the yellow figure of the input). You have to remember to preserve the colours.\\\\n7. To make the output, you have to place both the rectangular shapes on top of each other centrally in the grid, with the smaller rectangle shape on the inner side and the larger rectangle shape on the outside. The color of the smaller rectangle changes to purple, and any area where the larger rectangle overlays the smaller rectangle should become the color of the larger rectangle, in this case red. The remaining area should be black.\\\\n8. To make the output, you have to combine all the shapes (\\\\\\'T\\\\\\' and \\\\\\'H\\\\\\') into one single \\\\\\'T\\\\\\' shape in the center of the output. This \\\\\\'T\\\\\\' is made up of the red squares. The resulting \\\\\\'T\\\\\\' is surrounded by a margin made up of the teal squares, which becomes a square frame around the whole grid. The purple \\\\\\'T\\\\\\' should be turned into a purple \\\\\\'H\\\\\\' and placed inside the big \\\\\\'T\\\\\\', itself surrounded by empty (black) squares. The whole grid is then surrounded by a larger margin of red squares, also forming a square.\\\\n9. To make the output, you have to find the 11x11 square containing the two 2x2 squares in the middle. Then, you change the color where the two 2x2 squares existed to a third color creating a crossed pattern at the centre.\\\\n10. The transformation starts by taking the smallest square that contains the red figure, which consists of red pixels for its perimeter and the rest is black. Then, place the blue figure at the top-middle of this square, ensuring that its middle section (the lowest point of the \"V\") is touching the top-middle of the red figure square. Finally, you replace the black color in this new figure by red thereby turning the blue figure into all red. This results in a large square of red with a red \"V\" placed on top-middle inside this square. This contrasting red-on-red can be viewed as a new integrated figure.\\\\n11. To make the output, you have to combine the two 7x11 rectangles from the input into the grid, preserving their relative positions. Then, convert the top rectangle\\\\\\'s color (teal) into red and the bottom rectangle\\\\\\'s color (red) into yellow, retain the spaces within the shapes as is. For all outer cells which were black now become red comprising the boundary of output grid.\\\\n12. To make the output, you have to bring the two shapes together. The smaller shape should surround the bigger shape from all sides. Approximately half of the smaller shape\\\\\\'s colored cells should become the color of the larger shape, starting from the center outward. The remaining cells of the smaller shape and the larger shape should take the color of the smaller shape.  An outer perimeter of the smaller shape\\\\\\'s color should wrap around the combined shape.\\\\n13. To make the output, we are looking to merge the red square (Centre in the entire grid) and the yellow square (Quadrant 1 of the entire grid). The merging should be such that the common area of two is filled by the top primacy colour, i.e., yellow, while the rest of the area where red resides should be filled by black and yellow should take up the rest of the empty areas in the square grid. The newly formed grid should be cut three-fourth such that only the top left quadrant remains. This resultant part is then surrounded with green colour replicating the \\\\\\'centre square inside a hollow square\\\\\\' pattern.\\\\n14. To make the output, you have to compress both the teal and red symbols into a similar arrangement and positioning as in the input grid, but in a 5x5 space surrounded by the red color. The small yellow symbol should be compressed into a similar arrangement as in the input pattern but inside the bigger symbol. The bigger symbol should take the value and the color of the smallest isolated symbol in the input pattern. All these transformations should maintain the same pattern disposition.\\\\n15. To make the output, you have to combine the two shapes indicated by numbers 2 (red) and 4 (yellow) or 8 (teal). When combining into a square shape, the yellow or teal squares seem to be occupying the center of the red squares.\\\\n16. To transform the input into output, you need to follow these steps; 1. Merge the two inputs into a bigger square that is centered around the mid-point of the previously two separate squares. 2. Replace all the black spaces within the bigger square which is created from merging with the color of smaller square (blue in case 0 and yellow in case 1, and so on), if there is no color of the bigger square (red in case 0, and blue in case 1, and so on) in that position. 3. Finally, replace remaining black space by the color of the bigger square you\\\\\\'ve seen in the input image. The result will be the pattern of the smaller square expressed in the color of the bigger square.\\\\n17. To generate the output, overlay the patterns of the two letters in the input grid onto each other, and then scale down the dimension by half in both the x and y direction. Treat the yellow \u201cI\u201d as a mask that sits on top of the red \u201cH\u201d. When overlaid, the parts of \u201cH\u201d covered by \u201cI\u201d become red. The spots that were black in \u201cI\u201d but colored in \u201cH\u201d turn into yellow, and the spots that were black in both diagrams remain black.\\\\n18. To make the output, you have to first create a red square as the canvas. The side length is the sum of the side lengths of the red and teal squares from the input, plus two additional squares for the border. Then, inscribe a smaller teal square inside the red square. The side length of the teal square is the same as the bigger of the two squares in the input. Within this teal square, inscribe another even smaller red square. The side length of this red square is the difference between the side lengths of the two input squares. Fill all the remaining inside squares of the red square with black squares.\\\\n19. To make the output, you have to create a new square with the border made of Teal blocks from the input. The upper left corner of this new square is made of Red blocks. The center of this new shape if made of Yellow blocks. If yellow blocks are not sufficient they are filled with black blocks. The upper right corner, lower left corner and lower right corner are made up by Black color blocks.\\\\n20. To make the output the red square and the teal diamond are superposed centering them in the same point and squeezing them to fit the output size. The overlapping region creates a yellow square region inside the red square. The rules for overlapping colors are as follows: - Overlap of red and black: the output is red. - Overlap of  teal and black: the output is teal. - Overlap of red and teal: the output is yellow.\\\\n21. To make the output, you combine the larger rectangles so that they are on top of one another, the top rectangle shifted to the right and the bottom rectangle shifted to the left. The smaller details within the rectangle from the top will be inside the larger rectangle at the bottom in the output and vice versa. The rest of the grid should be filled with red.\\\\n22. To make the output, you have to  extract the color filled rectangles, along with their internal black cross structure. After this you combine each color filled rectangle internally with the other color-filled rectangles smaller than its size. The combined colored boxes should be the size of the smallest box with the color of the bigger box. The black crossboxes inside each rectangle should be retained. Also, place this combined box in place of original bigger box in the position where these boxes appear in the input (from top to bottom in the input). The outer box of the new combined box should be the color of the bigger box, and the size corresponding to it. Lastly, pad the remaining part of combined box with the color of the smaller box until it obtains the original size of the bigger box. The new structure should be surrounded by a grid of black boxes in the output to represent the border, thus making the bigger box look like it\\\\\\'s filled with both colors with the smaller box color at the inside, and larger box\\\\\\'s\\\\n23. To make the output, you have to merge the two rectangles from the input into one square in the output. To do this, remove the black cells between the two rectangles and adjust their width to match their height. As the rectangles merge, their crosses also become one cross. The color of the cross is a combination of the colors of the rectangles (red and teal combine to form yellow). The color of the rest of the square is the same as the color of the rectangles: red.   Thus, the pattern involves merging of shapes and color transformation.\\\\n24. To make the output, you have to find the larger rectangle, change the larger rectangle\\\\\\'s color to the color of the smaller rectangle, fill the center with the color of the larger rectangle, and fill the outermost layer of the square with the color of the larger rectangle. The rest of the cells are filled with the color of the smaller rectangle.\\\\n25. To create the output grid, pay attention to the input grid\\\\\\'s squares or rectangles. For each rectangle in the input, place a smaller rectangle in the output grid. The smaller rectangle\\\\\\'s position and dimensions in the output should correspond to the larger rectangle\\\\\\'s position in the input. This transformation shrinks each input rectangle to a quarter of its original size - halving the width and halving the height. The color of each smaller rectangle corresponds to color of the larger rectangle it was derived from. If there are two rectangles in the input and one of them is smaller and inside the bigger one, you have to draw one rectangle inside of another in the output.\\\\n26. To make the output, begin by taking the blue and red rectangles from the input and halving their sizes to fit the output grid. This involves re-scaling the rectangles to be two dots smaller on all sides. Next, you have to overlay the two rectangles on one another so that a box filled with some color represents that color appeared either in the upper half or lower half of the input grid. Blue dots that do not overlap with Red dots remain blue. Red dots that do not overlap with Blue dots remain red. Dots that were both red and blue (overlap) in the input grid, become green in the output grid. Black spaces remain black. The output consists of the overlay of these two shapes where Blue=8, Red=2, Overlap/\\\\n27. To transform the grid, first identify the two separate colored shapes in the input. For each colored shape, find the barycenter (center point) of the shape by considering the colored cells. Next, in the output grid, transpose the two shapes by moving their barycenters to the opposite side, so the red shape center goes to the location of the teal shape center and vice versa, keeping the shape integrity. Fill the remaining parts of square, which are not filled by transposed shapes by red.\\\\n28. In the transformation, the upper part of the image is mirrored to the bottom part of the image. The Red square of the initial image is replaced with the reflection of the Teal square. Hence, both the top and bottom squares become Teal.  The inner Black square of the top square is replaced with a Yellow square that is positioned to the left. The inner black square of the bottom square is replaced with an extension of the Yellow square, positioned to the top right of the bottom square. Finally, all parts outside the mirrored squares become red, creating a bigger Red square that encloses the entire formation.\\\\n29. To make the output, you have to place the smaller rectangle inside the larger one, centred and aligned along the diagonal, with all remaining squares filled with red squares. The entire pattern must be framed by a border of red squares.\\\\n30. To make the output, you have to overlay the smaller shape onto the larger shape. You should maintain the perimeter of the larger shape and fill it with red squares. The overlaid region should be filled with yellow squares. For the remaining space within the large shape perimeter which isn\\\\\\'t filled with the smaller shape, fill it with black squares.\\\\n31. To make the output, you have to take the two shapes on the input grid and superimpose the smaller rectangle onto the larger rectangle, such that the size of the larger rectangle does not change. The size of the smaller rectangle should be adjusted (compressed or stretched) to match the inner area of the larger shape. This means that the top row, bottom row, and the first and last column of the larger shape are not adjusted. Any cells that are common to both shapes should take on the color of the smaller rectangle (2 in our case), and any cells that are only part of the larger rectangle should take on the color of the larger rectangle (8 in our case). Cells that are part of neither shape should be colored black (0).\\\\n32. To make the output, you have to place the smaller box (the one with red squares) in the lower right portion of the larger box (replacing the empty spaces). Rotate the entire contents by 180 degrees. Then select a square area that covers the entire smaller box and the adjacent squares of the larger box. If there are squares that originally belonged to the smaller box but are not covered, ignore them.\\\\n33. To create the output, you need to overlay the red square with the purple plus (centered and scaled). Where the final symbol is red, color it in purple, and where it is black, keep it black. Leave a red border (width of 1) around the final symbol.\\\\n34. To make the output, you have to combine the two rectangles in the input into one in the output. The output rectangle is as big as the original red rectangle, with the blue rectangle copied into the center. The rest of the spaces in the surrounding rectangle that were not covered by the smaller blue rectangle, are filled with red squares. Also, the position of the red and blue squares are swapped i.e. red squares from the input grid become blue in the output and vice versa.\\\\n35. To make the output, you have to shrink the given structures maintaining their shapes but removing the holes in the structures. Then, place them side by side with no space between them. The outline color of the structures should be red and the rest should be colour of the original shapes.\\\\n36. To make the output, first identify the red block and measure its width and height. This will determine the size of your output grid. Fill the entire output grid with red. Then, put a hole equivalent to the size of the blue block from the input in the middle of your red block, leaving an equivalent border of red cells around it as in the input. Finally, mark a blue block inside the hole, just like  the one from the input. To perfectly size this blue block, consider the size of the hole in the red block from the input, and use this as the size of your blue block. Remember to center this blue block inside the hole.\\\\n37. To make the output, you have to merge the two seperate shapes to a single shape in a new single grid. The merge is done by placing the plus sign in the middle of the rectangle. If the two shapes don\\\\\\'t have the same middle point, the biggest one\\\\\\'s middle point is considered. The size of the output grid matches the outer shape/size. Empty spaces outside the shapes are filled with the color of rectangle (red) and the spaces inside of them are filled with the color of the sign (teal).\\\\n38. To make the output, you have to condense the three squares into one while maintaining the integrity of the pixel contact points. The transformation involves rescaling the original squares into a unified single square. The condensation process involves merging the pixels in contact. For example, in the output, you will see red pixels surrounding four sides and teal and purple pixels inside as a result of the pixels merged from the input shapes.\\\\n39. In the output, the image of the large teal square and the small purple square are combined. The smaller square is placed inside the larger square with its edges aligned to the center of each side of the larger square. If there is a conflict between the teal and purple pixels, the purple one takes precedence.\\\\n40. The transformation involves focusing on the teal and purple elements and merging them into a new shape placed centrally in the output grid. The teal element forms the outer shell of the resulting structure, creating a larger square within which the small purple element resides at the left top\u2013corner.   The process can be described in steps as follows.   1. Identify the teal and purple elements in the input grid.   2. Create a square using the teal element whose length is the maximum of the heights of both the teal and purple elements, and width is the sum of widths of both the teal and purple elements.   3. Inside the large teal square, place the small four-boxed purple element at the left top\u2013corner. The remaining part within the teal square is filled with black cells.\\\\n41. To make the output, you have to merge the two large squares (red and teal) into one square shape that has the dimensions of each of the two large squares. The outer border should be colored in the red color and the inner square should be colored in the teal color. Also, add three rows of blue color in the center paralleled to the borders (same width as the red border). The rest filler is the red color. Please note that the cells that correspond to the corners of the blue square need to be filled in with the blue color.\\\\n42. To make the output, you have to zoom in on the key elements of the input grid while ignoring the black padding, then overlay the two focused patterns onto each other. Here\\\\\\'s the step-by-step process:  1. Crop the extensive black padding from around the two squares leaving only one row/column of black cells around them as border. Now you have two smaller \"focused\" grids, one for each colour. 2. Overlay the two focused grids on top of each other. Wherever a cell contains a number higher than 0 in both grids, the grid with the higher number takes precedence. 3. There\\\\\\'s one small tweak in the overlay operation above. Whenever a cell inside the red square corresponds to a cell inside the blue square, the output cell takes the blue square\\\\\\'s value. The red square is effectively cropped again to be the inverted image of the blue square. 4. In the final output, the red square forms a sort of border around the blue square, or a blue box inside a red box.\\\\n43. To make the output, you have to combine both input shapes together in their original orientation. The purple shape is put at the top half of the output grid, the red shape is put at the lower half, and the lines between them are filled with red boxes. This forms the outermost boundary of the shapes on the output grid. Then, any remaining empty spaces inside these shapes are filled with purple boxes, and any empty spaces outside the shapes remain as black boxes.\\\\n44. To make the output, extract both shapes from the input, the large shape always forms the border of the output. The small shape is placed in the center of this large shape (which becomes red) and then, the entire area between the small and large shapes should be filled with the color of the small shape.\\\\n45. To make the output, you have to combine both figures (the large square and the arrow) in the same region, putting the arrow inside the square. The placement of the arrow in the big square can be exactly in the middle of it, and the size of the overarching square will then be adjusted accordingly to fit the arrow inside perfectly, with black cells as space.  All remaining parts of the grid, that are not directly part of the two original patterns should be excluded from the output grid. Furthermore, colors from both patterns should combine, resulting in a composite color in the output.\\\\n46. The transformation includes three steps:  1. Find the smallest rectangle that encompasses each distinct figure on the grid. This step clumps together pixels of the same color that form a shape (with no black pixels inside). 2. Shrink the rectangles proportionally so they can fit into the 11x11 output grid, while maintaining their relative position to each other. 3. In the case of overlapping occurring during the shrink process, the overlapped grid gets the color of the higher number (Blue: 4, Red: 2), implying that blue will always overlap red if overlapping occurs.\\\\n47. To make the output, you have to overlay the bigger red rectangle and the smaller blue triangle. If both cells are black, the output should be black. If one is red and the other is black, the output should be red. If one is blue and the other is black, the output should be blue. If the red rectangle and the blue triangle overlap, the output should be red. After the overlay, the bigger filled shape(black shapes inclusive) should be resized to fit in an 8x8 area surrounded by a circle of red cells.\\\\n48. To make the output, you have to create a red square the size of the vertical span of the non-black shapes in the input. Put a yellow triangle inside. The triangle\\\\\\'s edges touch the red square\\\\\\'s edges, and its point goes inwards. If the span is odd, the triangle doesn\\\\\\'t quite reach the center and a red box is in the very center. If the span is even, the triangle reaches the center and there is a 2x2 red box in the very center.\\\\n49. To transform the grid from the input to the output, you need to overlay the two colored squares on top of each other, with the smaller square being the centerpiece and the colored edge of the larger square forming the outside edge of the output square. In other words, you combine the two squares into one, the large square now contains the small square in the middle, and both squares share a common center.\\\\n50. To make the output, you need to keep the colored squares in the exact shape they are in, however, you need to \"push\" them together so they are next to each other rather than separated by black space. Then, surround these combined squares by a large square made up of the color of the biggest square (including the diagonals). The rest of the squares should be filled with black.\\\\n51. To form the output grid, take the red rectangle from the top and resize it to fill the majority of the grid, then place a smaller blue rectangle in the center of the larger red rectangle. If the original rectangle had a hole in it (represented by black cells within the rectangle), fill the hole with cells of the other color. If the original rectangle was filled entirely with colored cells, the smaller rectangle should be hollow. Afterwards, add a border of the same color as the larger rectangle around the entire grid. The overall size of the grid should be adjusted to have the smallest possible size that still accommodates the pattern.\\\\n52. To make the output, you have to combine both squares into an enclosed structure. The bigger square forms the outer boundary and the smaller square is situated within this boundary at a mirroring position leaving space for the black (0-values) cells in between. The cells located along the diagonal of the output grid are colored according to the smaller square from the input, whereas the rest of the cells are colored according to the color of the bigger square from the input. Any cells that are outside of these two squares from the input are colored black (0-values).\\\\n53. The output grid forms another rectangle, this time with the original red rectangle and yellow square combined together. The region surrounding the red rectangle in the output is filled with the color of the yellow square from input, and vice versa.\\\\n54. To go from the input to the output, the transformation takes the shapes seen in the input and condenses them down into smaller, less pixelated versions. It retains their original color and the relative orientation to each other, but the shapes are fewer in pixel quantity and consequently distorted. Essentially, this transformation represents a downscaling or compression of the input grid, retaining the essential information but in a smaller size.\\\\n55. To transform the grid, you have to first encase both shapes in two separate and smallest possible squares. This can be done by finding the outermost colored pixels on each side. Then you vertically mirror the colored grid except for the black rows above and below. Next, combine the two mirrored images by superimposing them in such a way that the top one\\\\\\'s center coincides with the center of the bottom one. Black pixels from the bottom image should overwrite colored pixels from the top image where they coincide. Finally, encase the combination in the smallest possible square by removing all additional rows and columns that only contain black pixels and do not contain the combined pattern.   In shortest term, the pattern can be described as \"Encasing individual colored shapes, mirroring and superimposing them, and trim to fit.\"\\\\n56. To make the output, you have to take each of the rectangles and place the second one inside the first. Therefore, the output rectangle has a border color matching the first rectangle, an inner color matching the second rectangle, and an innermost color matching the first rectangle. Next, move the resulting rectangle to the top left corner.\\\\n57. To get the output, you need to squeeze the input colored grids on the top and bottom together. The black squares are condensed and the colored blocks hold relative shapes, but are combined. The red portion on the input retains its red color on the output and the yellow portion turns into orange.\\\\n58. To make the output, you have to first organize the grid into a large square with the side length being the vertical distance between the two leftmost colored cells of the two different shapes. Then fill the outermost square with the color of the bottom shape in the input, then fill the next inner squares alternatively with the colors of the top and bottom shapes in the input until the center. The size of each colored square reduces by one grid as we move towards the center from the outside. Fill the remaining center squares with color of the topmost shape in the input if the size of the center square is odd else use the color of bottom shape. In case of even number of squares after grouping them into two shapes, allocate the extra square to the top shape to balance it out.\\\\n59. To make the output, the pattern is to superimpose the two symbols one over the other, maintaining the blue symbol as the border. The parts of the blue symbol that are superimposed over white blocks in the red symbol are replaced with white blocks. If the red symbol portion contains any black blocks, those are ignored and the original blue of the corresponding block in the blue symbol is maintained. All white blocks outside of the new symbol are turned into black.\\\\n60. In order to produce the output grid, you firstly surround the area between the two squares with red cells. Then, you fill the top left side of the biggest square with red cells, and the bottom right side with blue cells. The remaining cells inside the yellow square (not colored in red or blue) should be black (non colored).\\\\n61. To make the output, you have to create a square. The edges of the square are made of red cells. The top left quarter of the square should be filled with black cells. The bottom left and top right quarters of the square should be filled with blue cells. The bottom right quarter of the square should stay with the originally red cells.\\\\n62. To make the output, you have to create a new red square by reflecting the red rectangle four times towards the center of the image to fill the entire new square grid. You also have to create a new smaller teal square by reflecting the teal square four times toward the center of the image and place it in the middle of the larger red square. The rest of the grid should be filled with black cells.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "After analyzing the rules, they can be categorized into eight distinct categories based on their similarities:\n\n1.

Rules involving shape compression and decompression: 1, 2, 3", "('[{\\'role\\': \\'system\\', \\'content\\': \\'You are a genius solving language puzzles.\\'}, {\\'role\\': \\'user\\', \\'content\\': \\'Given a list of rules, categorize them into eight distinct categories based on their similarities. For each category, synthesize the rules into a single, specific rule that combines the ideas of all rules in that category, while clearly differentiating it from the other categories.\\\\nThe new rule should be as specific as possible, following the format of the given rules.\\\\nThe new rule should be applicable without any information from the original rules - i.e. it should be standalone.\\\\n\\\\nRules:\\\\n1. To create the output, find the 3x3 squares of blue cells in the input. For each square, turn the middle cell and the cells surrounding it except the black ones into red. The other colors should remain the same.\\\\n2. To make the output, take a look at each 3x3 square formed from the cells of the input grid. If this 3x3 pattern appears like a blue \u201cdonut\u201d - a hollow square with a blue border and black in the center - replace the blue cells which form the \"donut\" with red. Leave the rest of the cells unchanged.\\\\n3. To make the output, you have to identify the squares surrounded by blue squares. A square is considered surrounded only if it has blue squares directly above, below and on the sides. Diagonal doesn\\\\\\'t count.  Then turn those specific squares into red squares. Leave everything else as it is from the original grid. Also keep in mind that the borders of the grid are considered a wall, i.e., squares at the borders would need a blue square as a neighbour where the border is, to be marked as surrounded.\\\\n4. Duplicate the entire input layout into the output. However, there is a change in cell color. For every three consecutive blue cells horizontally or vertically in the input grid, the center cell turns red in the output. All other cells remain as they are in the input. Black cells from the input remain black in the output. Single blue cells or blue cells in pairs (horizontally or vertically) remain blue in the output.\\\\n5. To make the output, you must check the cells in the top and bottom areas where the blue cells form the shape of \"5\" and \"2\" respectively. In the top area where there\\\\\\'s a cell filled with blue (1) above, to the left, and right to a black cell (0), replace this black cell (0) with a red cell (2). Do the same for the bottom area but this time, look for a cell filled with blue (1) below, to the left, and right to a black cell (0) to replace this black cell (0) with red (2). The remaining cells remain the same as in the input grid.\\\\n6. Every blue cell that forms \u201cE\u201d or \u201c3\u201d letter is changed to black. On the other hand, every black cell that forms \"E\" or \"3\" is changed to red while preserving the original black cells elsewhere. The grid parts do not forming letters (containing only black and blue cells) are left unchanged.\\\\n7. To make the output, you have to detect the numbers. If a grid square is part of the number 4, change the color to red. Keep the rest of the grid the same.\\\\n8. To make the output, you have to understand that whenever a \"1\" appears in the original blue lines, it will be converted to a red \"2\" in the output. The rest of the grid remains the same.\\\\n9. To make the output, you have to transform the grid by swapping each occurrence of the pattern with a red pattern (2s). The blue pattern in this instance is a 3x3 square comprised of: the top and bottom lines entirely filled, the middle line with the center space empty. This pattern transforms into  the pattern: a vertical line in the center of the 3x3 square.\\\\n10. To transform the input grid to the output grid, you need to identify all blue cells that form the shape \"1\" and replace these blue cells with red. All the blue cells forming the shapes \"0\" and \"4\" should remain unchanged. The black cells should also remain unchanged.\\\\n11. The transformation involves identifying areas in the shape of numbers or letters that are completely surrounded by black. These blue shapes are changed to red in the output grid. The surrounding black and blue areas remain the same in the output grid.\\\\n12. The process of transforming the input grid into the output involves identifying vertical and horizontal lines in the blue section of the input grid. Any blue cell that is immediately surrounded by another two blue cells either vertically or horizontally should be changed to red on the output grid, while all other cells remain the same.\\\\n13. To form the output grid, for every group of cells forming a shape, replace the middlemost cell(s) with red cells. The middlemost cells are the ones that are equidistant from the edges of the shape. If there is no single middlemost cell (for example, in the case of 4 cells forming a square or a line), replace all the cells equidistant from the edges with red cells. The rest of the input grid remains unchanged.\\\\n14. To produce the output, look for blue figures above and below the horizontal axis. Change the blue figures to red in the figures above, and keep the blue color in the figures below. The remaining empty cells and the axis color remain unchanged.\\\\n15. To make the output, you have to identify the blue \"1\" cells that have a blue cell below and above them. Change these identified cells to red in the output. All the other cells in the output should remain the same as in the input.\\\\n16. To make the output, you have to place a red pixel in the position of each point (top left corner of the squares) of the two blue shapes (both the square and the triangle).\\\\n17. To make the output, you need to identify the center of the colored shape in the input grid. In the grid formed by the color, replace the central horizontal and vertical line with red 2s. If there is no exact center (for even dimensions), use the upper/closest lines. The rest of the grid will remain the same as the input grid.\\\\n18. To transform the grid, you have to identify the horizontal sections that forms a figure \\\\\\'1\\\\\\' in the input grid and paint that section in the output grid with a red color. The rest of the grid remains unchanged. Take note that a section is identified as figure \\\\\\'1\\\\\\' if it has blue cells in three consecutive rows in the same column, and in the middle row, there are more blue cells extending horizontally.\\\\n19. An output grid is created by following the rule that: If three or more blue cells form a conveyor (straight or curved) in one of the four cardinal directions at any point in the grid, put a red cell at the center of this configuration, while leaving all other cells as they were. In simpler terms, when there\\\\\\'s a straight line or a curve constructed from blue cells, the middle cell turns red.\\\\n20. The transformation involves detecting regions of touching blue cells in the input grid. A region of touching blue cells can be defined as a group of two or more blue cells that are adjacent either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.  When a region has a center (middle) blue cell (i.e., the region\\\\\\'s width or height is of odd length), replace the center blue cell with a red cell (2) and leave the other cells of the region as blue. If a region\\\\\\'s width AND height are both even, no red cell should be added. Additionally, if a region only consists of a single blue cell, leave it as is.  All the empty (black) cells remain empty (black) in the output grid.\\\\n21. To make the output, you have to replace the center part of the digital numbers where \\\\\\'1\\\\\\' becomes \\\\\\'2\\\\\\' and \\\\\\'2\\\\\\' become \\\\\\'1\\\\\\' leaving the surrounding blue squares untouched.\\\\n22. To make the output, you have to consider the locations of blue \"1\"s. If a blue \"1\" is surrounded on all sides (including diagonals) by at least five other blue \"1\"s, transform it into a red \"2\". All other cells remain the same.\\\\n23. The transformation seems to occur in a way where we are highlighting or differentiating sections of the image or grid where the 1\\\\\\'s form a direct horizontal or vertical line of three or more. Whenever three or more consecutive \\\\\\'1\\\\\\'s are found horizontally or vertically in the input, they transform into \\\\\\'2\\\\\\'s in the same location on the output grid. The rest of the pattern remains unaltered with no change from the input to the output grid.\\\\n24. The transformation rule is that within rows 1-5, any pixel which is surrounded by blue pixels on its left, right, and top when considering only these rows, turn it red. Likewise, within rows 6-10, any pixel which is surrounded by blue pixels on its left, right, and bottom when considering only these rows, turn it red.\\\\n25. To obtain the output from the input, check each cell in the input grid and follow this rule: if a turquoise cell is surrounded by other turquoise cells in all four directions (right, left, up and down), color that cell red in the output. That is, a cell is colored red if it has neighbors at the right and left, and also at the top and bottom, which are turquoise in the input. All other cells remain the same color as in the input.\\\\n26. To make the output, look for rows that have three adjacent blue squares forming a line (either vertically or horizontally) and turn those squares into red on the same position on the output grid. The rest of the squares stay the same.\\\\n27. To make the output, replace the blue blocks that form a \\\\\\'T\\\\\\' shape in either of the 3x3 squares with red blocks. A \\\\\\'T\\\\\\' shape in this context is defined as three consecutive blue blocks in a row or column with another blue block adjacent to the middle one in the perpendicular direction. The rest of the grid maintains its original state.\\\\n28. To make the output, observe the formations of 1s (blue) in the input. Whenever there is a horizontal row of three 1s (whether it is completely horizontal, or slightly tilted either upwards or downwards), replace the middle 1 with 2 (red) in the output. For all the other patterns, their configuration remains the same between the input and output.\\\\n29. Replace a 3 sized \\\\\\'111\\\\\\' pattern that is adjacent in horizontal direction to \\\\\\'200\\\\\\' in both the top and the bottom half of the grid. All the other values should remain same. This transformation is applied to each row in the grid.\\\\n30. To make the output, you have to look for the cells that are occupied by the number \\\\\\'1\\\\\\' at the intersection area of the number representation from left to right and from top to bottom. Replace these cells with red (2) cells. The rest of the grid remains the same.\\\\n31. To transform the grid, focus on the blue regions resembling the digits or letters. Wherever a horizontal or vertical line of blue blocks is encountered, check if there is a symmetry about the line. If there is, replace the line with red blocks but leave the rest unchanged.\\\\n32. To make the output, examine the original input grid. Wherever there is a continuous blue figure in the shape of a rectangle or a line, turn the entire shape red. All other blue or black cells retain their color.\\\\n33. You have to substitute the central row of any horizontal or vertical line of blue cells formed in the number shape on the grid, with red cells. If there are an even number of rows in the line, take the upper middle row. The color of the rest of the cells remains the same.\\\\n34. The transformation involves interpreting the digital numbers in the initial state and transforming certain parts of it. Specifically, each row in the input that represents a \"1\" in digital form must be transformed into a \"2\" in the output, and this transformation applies to both the top half (rows 1-5) and the bottom half (rows 6-10) of the grid. All other parts of the grid remain unchanged.\\\\n35. To make the output, you have to replace the central square of each blue pattern in every row with red, if the pattern is three blue squares aligned straight. Other blue squares remain the same, and black ones remain the same as well.\\\\n36. To make the output, you have to convert every \"1\" that is contained within the boundaries of the mirror image of the \"1\" shape into a red \"2\", while keeping everything else the same.\\\\n37. To transform the input grid into the output grid, identify the clusters of blue cells in the input grid. These clusters are located at the top-middle, middle-right and bottom-middle of the grid. Change the center cells of these blue clusters to red in the output grid, while keeping other cells the same color. The center cell of a cluster is defined as the cell with equal number of cells on its left and right in the same row and equal number of cells above and below in same column. If number of cells is even, center cell is the one on the right or down to the exact center.\\\\n38. To make the output, you need to first analyze the input grid\\\\\\'s blue \\\\\\'L\\\\\\' shapes and register the space where they are located. Then, refer back to the grid and replace each blue cell that is not part of these \\\\\\'L\\\\\\' shapes with a red cell. All the cells forming part of the \\\\\\'L\\\\\\' shapes stay the same, and the black cells do not change either.\\\\n39. To make the output, you have to identify the digit \\\\\\'2\\\\\\' formed by blue blocks in the input and change those corresponding blocks in the output grid to red. All the other colors and spaces remain the same. In cases when the digit \\\\\\'2\\\\\\' is rotated or mirrored, it is still considered as \\\\\\'2\\\\\\'. It should be noted that the figures are formed by a 3x3 square where the horizontal line is in the middle row and the digits are always 3 blocks in length.\\\\n40. To make the output, you have to convert every box of the \\\\\\'3\\\\\\' to red while leaving the \\\\\\'8\\\\\\' as it is. In other words, convert the inner boxes of the \\\\\\'3\\\\\\' to red while leaving the rest of the grid as it is.\\\\n41. To derive the output grid from the input grid, the transformation follows a rule that identifies groups of three adjacent blue cells (1) in a row in the input, either horizontally or vertically, and changes the middle cell to red (2) in the output. All other cells remain the same. Note that the adjacency rule does not apply diagonally.\\\\n42. To obtain the output from the input, we need to identify the inverse number 0 forming in-between the blue number 0s, and make it red, while the rest of the grid remains the same as the input.\\\\n43. To transform the grid, you have to fill in the corresponding areas of these patterns with red boxes. It includes any cell that contains a blue box (in the top half) or is devoid of a blue box (in the bottom half).  To determine where to fill in the red boxes, imagine a horizontal line in the middle of the grid. For the top half of the grid, fill in the red boxes where there are blue boxes. For the bottom half of the grid, fill in the red boxes where there are no blue boxes. Keep the blue boxes in their original position as they were in the input grid. Finally, leave the black boxes as they are on the top half and the bottom half grid.\\\\n44. Begin by determining the objects/sections formed by ones in three vertical sections of the grid: left, middle, and right. If the shape formed by the ones in the left and middle sections matches exactly, replace the ones in the middle with twos. Likewise, if the shape formed by the ones in the right and middle sections matches exactly, replace the ones in the middle with twos. The shapes are treated as distinct if they have different configurations or if they are in different positions within their respective sections.\\\\n45. The pattern fills in the spaces in the blue quadrants on the input grid to create red shapes in the output grid. For each quadrant, if there are extra blue cells inside the quadrant, fill all the empty cells in the quadrant with red cells. The cross remains blue.\\\\n46. To make the output, observe the pattern of blue cells in each row. If three consecutive blue cells are aligned horizontally, replace them with red cells. Everything else in the grid should be left unchanged.\\\\n47. To make the output, you have to change the middle blue line that has a black box in the third position. You should transform the surrounding blue boxes into red boxes. The black and blue boxes left unchanged from the input grid.\\\\n48. To make the output, you have to identify squares where blue boxes form a \\\\\\'T\\\\\\' shape. After identifying these squares, change the blue boxes in the column of the \\\\\\'T\\\\\\' shape into red boxes, while keeping the rest of the grid the same. The \\\\\\'T\\\\\\' shape is considered as three blue boxes in a row (horizontally) and two additional blue boxes under the middle box of the horizontal row. It can be rotated in any direction.\\\\n49. To make the output, you have to replace the middle cell of each 3x3 blue squares with a red cell if there is nothing else in the middle column of the grid else leave it as blue. Replace the other blue cells in the 3x3 square with black. Keep the rest of the grid the same.\\\\n50. To make the output, you have to follow this rule: If a blue cell in the input grid is surrounded (above, below, to the left, and to the right) by at least three blue cells, that cell has to be converted to red in the output grid. All other cells maintain their colors.\\\\n51. To transform the input into the output, identify the 3x3 segment across the diagonal on the input from top left to bottom right. Replace the cells in the corresponding diagonal on the output grid with red where the input has blue, and keep the rest of the cells black. Preserve the existing blue and black cells on the other region of the grid untouched.\\\\n52. Each 3x3 blue square area in the input is transformed to a 3x3 square in the output with the 3 squares filled with red color in the shape of an inverted \"T\" (2 squares vertically at the center and a square horizontally at the top middle). The remaining squares remain the same as in the input.\\\\n53. To make the output, you have to change some of the blue cells to red. If a blue digit is surrounded by black cells at its right, left, top, and bottom, then the blue cell should be changed to red cell. Keep other cells as they are in the input.\\\\n54. The transformation includes replacing the horizontal and vertical number 1 (blue) groups of three cells with number 2 (red). This transformation should not consider diagonally arranged cells but only vertical and horizontal ones.\\\\n55. The transformation involves identifying the specific shape indicated by the blue squares in the input grid. The specific shape is a Horizontally Mirrored letter \\\\\\'P\\\\\\'. Replace this specific shape from Blue (1) to Red (2). For rest of the grid, the blue (1) and black (0) squares remain the same as in the input grid.\\\\n56. Draw a red box around the largest group of blue boxes which are connected to each other by their sides i.e vertically or horizontally, and not diagonally, within each square. If there is a tie in the size of the groups, color all the tieing groups.\\\\n57. To make the output, you have to change some of the blue colour figures into red. Specifically, you should change the middle blue figure in each row containing 3 consecutive blue figures. If there are no 3 consecutive blue boxes in a row, the grid remains the same.\\\\n58. To make the output, you have to detect the letter \\\\\\'A\\\\\\' and \\\\\\'B\\\\\\'shape formed by blue cells in the input. The letter \\\\\\'A\\\\\\' is transformed into a letter \\\\\\'A\\\\\\' created with red cells in the output. The letter \\\\\\'B\\\\\\' is transformed into a letter \\\\\\'B\\\\\\' created with blue cells in the output. Everything else remains the same.\\\\n59. To make the output, look at each blue line segment in the grid, if it\\\\\\'s horizontal, keep it blue; but if it\\\\\\'s vertical, change the color to red. The black squares remain black in either case.\\\\n60. To make the output, you need to first identify the 3x3 blue figure in the input grid and convert it to a red figure formed by central element in the output and other blue boxes will remain unchanged. The black boxes remain the same throughout.\\\\n61. To make the output, you have to change the blue cells (number 1) that composed the top and bottom lines of each number to red (number 2). For example, number one in digital form, the top and bottom line means the blue pixels forming the lines at top and bottom, and the rest remains as blue. The black cells remain unchanged.\\\\n62. To make the output, you have to replace the central block of each blue shape with a red block. The central block is defined as the block that has the same number of other blocks of the shape to the left and right of it, and to the top and bottom of it. If the shape is just one row/column, the central block(s) is the one in the middle of the row/column. If there is more than one that can be called \"central\", replace all of them.\\\\n63. To make the output, find the three blue blocks in row which also shares the column with blue blocks. Then, change these blocks to red in the output. The other blocks remain same as in the input. For the rest of the blocks, if it\\\\\\'s a blue block in the input, it remains a blue block in the output. If it\\\\\\'s a black block in the input, it remains a black block in the output.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "Category 1: Rules involving 3x3 squares\n1.

To make the output, you have to identify the squares surrounded by blue squares. A square is considered surrounded only if it has blue squares directly above, below and on the sides. Diagonal doesn't count.  Then turn those specific squares into red squares. Leave everything else as it is from the original grid. Also keep in mind that the borders of the grid are considered a wall, i.e., squares at the borders would need a blue square as a neighbour where the border is, to be marked as surrounded.\n22.

If a blue \"1\" is surrounded on all sides (including diagonals) by at least five other blue \"1\"s, transform it into a red \"2\". All other cells remain the same.\n25. To obtain the output from the input, check each cell in the input grid and follow this rule: if a turquoise cell is surrounded by other turquoise cells in all four directions (right, left, up and down), color that cell red in the output. That is, a cell is colored red if it has neighbors at the right and left, and also at the top and bottom, which are turquoise in the input. All other cells remain the same color as in the input.\n50.

In the transformation, all grey cells in the input grid remain as they are. Non-grey cells in both the rows immediately above and below a gray row are transformed into black cells. For the remaining cells, only those non-grey cells which have a higher value than the neighbouring non-grey cells in the same row are transformed into black cells, while all other non-grey cells are transformed into grey cells.  Note - In a row, cells are compared with their neighbours on the horizontal axis, skipping over grey cells if necessary. This means cells are compared with the next non-grey cell in the row. If there is no non-grey neighbouring cell, then the cell in question is transformed into a grey cell.\\\\n2. To make the output, scan each row and retain the highest colored number if it is not grey and replace it on the middle grey cell. All the other cells in the row should become black.\\\\n3. To make the output, you should keep all the gray cells from the input. For the non-gray cells, keep only the maximum value cell in each 5x5 region around the gray line. The maximum value is considered among the non-zero and non-grey cells. If a region does not include any non-zero, non-gray cells, then fill it with zeroes.\\\\n4. To make the output, you have to examine the sections above and below the turquoise line. The cells in the output grid that corresponds to the ones with the highest numbers in their respective sections become maroon, while the rest are black. The turquoise line remains the same. So the maximum value in each section on the input grid is turned into a colored cell of the section\\\\\\'s specific color in the output, while all other cells become black, keeping the turquoise lines as is.\\\\n5. To make the output, leave the entire line of gray color (5) unchanged. Around the lines with number 5, you should only keep the highest number from each quarter of the grid (broken down by the lines with number 5), and replace the rest with black (0).\\\\n6. To make the output, you have to take the maximum value of color in each quadrant excluding the grey and black, and replace it with the maximum color value while making every other color black and keeping grey as it is. If there are no colors in any quadrant, the quadrant remains black.\\\\n7. To make the output, you have to find only the maximum value color in each third and replace it with color 5 in the output. All other cells become black, with the exception of the middle section always being color 5.\\\\n8. To make the output, you have to identify the number 5 row within the grid. If the row below it is not the number 5 row, you replace all the cells in that row, except those containing the number 5, with 0. If the row below the number 5 row is a colored row, you should replace the cells in it, that are not number 5 and do not have a matched number in the colored row above the last number 5 row, with the number 0. Place all the matched numbers in the cells that correspond to their position in the previous colored row seen before the last number 5 row. Overall, depending on the row\\\\\\'s position relative to the number 5 row, altterations are made with cells being replaced with 0 or matching numbers from the previous colored row above the last number 5 row.\\\\n9. To make the output, you have to perform the following:  If a cell is a gray (5) row or a black (0), then it remains the same.   If it\u2019s a colored row (other than black 0 and gray 5) in the upper section, replace all colors that are not shades of gray (0 or 5) with black (0) except for the highest number in the row, replace it with the highest number from the equivalent row in the bottom section.   If it\u2019s a colored row (other than black 0 and gray 5) in the bottom section, replace all colors (0 or 5) with black (0).  Note: By \"equivalent row in the bottom section\", I mean the row at the same distance from the middle gray line as the row in question but in the opposite section.\\\\n10. To make the output, you have to look at the two sections at the top in the input. Compare the number of each color in these sections except for gray and black. Replace each cell in the output similar section with the color that is less common in the other corresponding section of the input. Gray and black cells remain the same.\\\\n11. To make the output, replace all non-gray cells with a black cell. Then, for each non-black cell in the top section of the original grid (not counting the gray strip), if there is a cell of the same color in the bottom section of the grid (again not counting the gray strip), replace the matching cell in the bottom section with a gray cell in the output. Keep the gray strip untouched in the output. The color replacement in the middle and the bottom section should look for the highest valued cell of that color in the top section. If two cells have the same highest value, try both of them one by one.\\\\n12. To make the output from the input, you will have to follow this rule: first of all, keep the teal (5) horizontal line from the input grid to output grid untouched. Then, for the section above the teal line, replace all colored numbers with black (0), and for the section below the teal line, replace all colored cells with black (0) EXCEPT for the cells that have the highest value in each row -- these should remain the same.\\\\n13. To transform the input into the output, observe that for every row on either side of the grey colored line, any non-black cell that isn\\\\\\'t grey should become black, except for the highest numerical value which remains the same color, and all other cells should remain the same. In case there are multiple cells with the same highest value, only the rightmost should retain its color. Grey colored line remains the same.\\\\n14. To make the output, you have to keep the Gray 5s that create the lines in the same place. For the numbers that are not 5, keep the largest number in the group of three rows between the gray 5 lines, and convert all other numbers to black. If you have multiple largest number just select the lowest one from top to bottom. For the numbers that are on the same level as the Grey 5s, convert them into black.\\\\n15. It seems complex pattern, but it\\\\\\'s not. You recognize that only the maximum value from each 5x5 block surrounded by \\\\\\'5\\\\\\' is saved in the output. So the rule is: Check each block of 5x5 numbers in the input, find the maximum number and put it in the center of the corresponding block in the output. The remaining boxes in each block in the output, fill with \\\\\\'0\\\\\\' and keep the surrounding \\\\\\'5s\\\\\\' as it is.\\\\n16. To make the output, you have to replace every number that is not on the gray row with zero (black). For the numbers that are filled into the block containing the gray row, you have to retain the highest number and replace all others in the block with zero.\\\\n17. The transformation involves rotating the grid multiple times. Each of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 6th, 7th, 9th, 10th, and 11th rows (from both top and bottom) is turned into black cells except the middle five, which are blue, yielding a pattern similar to the 4th and 8th rows in the input, i.e., [0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0]. The 4th and 8th rows remain the same in the output as they were in the input. Exceptions are the cells located on symmetric diagonals for these two rows: if the cell at the symmetric diagonal, as well as the cell itself, located on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 6th, 7th,\\\\n18. To make the output, replace every cell except for the cells in the grey vertical line with black color. For the cells on both sides of the grey line, find the cells (except the black ones) that appear more in the cells on right side of the line than the left side in the same row. Keep these cells (in corresponding positions) and replace the rest with black. Make sure the gray line remains the same.\\\\n19. To make the output, you have to change the colors other than grey, blue, and coral to black. Then, for each interval between the bands of grey, remove the color that is not aligned with the color of coral. Finally, replace the color that is aligned with the color of coral with the highest number in all the intervals. The next highest number should be replaced in the next interval and so on.\\\\n20. To make the output, you have to clear all colors except for the largest number in each set of three rows above and below the squares. The largest color number should replace the middle of the three corresponding squares in the output. Other squares outside the center \\\\\\'5\\\\\\' should be black. For example, consider rows 1 to 3. Only the square with the largest color number is kept (if no colors, it remains black). This chosen color then replaces the middle \\\\\\'5\\\\\\' square in both the original row and the corresponding row in the output. The rest of the output grids remain the same. Repeat this with rows 5 to 7 and 9 to 11.\\\\n21. To get the output from the input, for each of the first and third part, count the colors in the columns above and below the horizontal gray line. If a color appears more than once, it appears in the output grid, otherwise it does not. Black cells remain as black cells and the horizontal gray line remains the same.\\\\n22. To make the output, you have to preserve the yellow lines and keep all other cells black except in the band just above the yellow line where grey blocks were. Move the grey blocks randomly scattered in the band just below the yellow line. Keep all other colored blocks as black.\\\\n23. To make the output, check for colored square in rows above and below the teal (5) row, keep only the maximum and minimum values per column and replace all others with black. The color teal should stay consistent throughout all cases.\\\\n24. To make the output, you have to replace all colored cells that are not grey with black, and the rest of the colored cells take the maximum value from the mirror location in the opposite quadrant across both horizontal and vertical grey line. If there are multiple equal maximum values, take any one.\\\\n25. Keep the grey strips in the original location. For all the rows which are not solely grey, take the greatest number present which is not black or grey, make this the new row value for all squares in this row with the original condition that grey squares stay grey. All remaining squares should be filled in black. If the row did not have any non-black and non-grey number, make all the squares in this row black except those which were originally grey.\\\\n26. To make the output, you have to keep the grey band (the row of numbers 5) as it is, but outside the grey band, keep only the number that appears the most in each segment. Replace all other colours in each segment with black. If there is a tie for the number that occurs most frequently, choose the largest number. If the segment only has black numbers besides the grey band (number 5), leave it as it is.\\\\n27. To transform the input grid into the output grid, first keep the two horizontal lines made from purple as they are. Now for the other cells, replace each color cell with a black cell except for the color cell which appears most frequently just before the second purple line. Replace this cell with a teal cell. If there is a tie for most frequent, choose the color of the cell which appears first from left in the row just before the second purple line.\\\\n28. To make the output, you have to identify the set of number color boxes with the maximum sum in each section. If more than one set has the maximum sum, choose the set that appears first from left to right, top to bottom. Replace the black boxes on either side of the grey color boxes with this set of color number boxes. All other boxes should become black, and the grey color boxes should stay the same.\\\\n29. To obtain the output from the input grid, note the grey lines that horizontally divide the grid into several horizontal sections. Each section between (and including) the grey lines should be transformed as follows: within each such section, keep only the maximum numbered cell color (ignoring black and grey), and turn all other colored cells to black. Note that the grey lines themselves are unchanged.\\\\n30. To transform the input into the output, scan each of the non-grey rows. For each visible color in a row, find its maximum numerical equivalent and place it at the original grey cell\\\\\\'s position for that row in the output. If there were no visible colors in a row of input, keep all black cells in that row in the output. The grey rows are copied unchanged from input to output.\\\\n31. To make the output, swap the colored cells only from the first three rows and the last three rows with each other. Specifically, swap the first row with the last row, the second row with the second to last row, and the third row with the third to last row. At the same time, keep the middle row (made of purple cells) and the middle column as it is in the input. For the rest of the cells, turn them into black cells.\\\\n32. To make the output, replace each colored box of upper part of the input grid with black box in the output, leave the boxes in the grey line as they are. For the lower part of the grid, replace each colored box with a black box except the rightmost colored box in non-black rows. Leave the rightmost colored box in non-black rows of the lower part as they appear in the input grid.\\\\n33. To make the output, you have to calculate the product of all the non-grey cells (nonempty and non-5s cells) in each quadrant of the input grid and then, place the product at the matching position in each quadrant of the output grid. All the other spaces in the grid, including the purple line, will be filled with grey cells (5s).\\\\n34. To make the output, you need to replace each quadrant with the most recurring non-black and non-grey color in their respective quadrant. If a quadrant only contains black or grey squares, replace all cells of that quadrant with black. The grey lines dividing the quadrants remain the same.\\\\n35. To transform the input grid into the output, you should perform the following steps:  1. Identify the centre line of the grid (the row filled with only grey cells). 2. For each of the top and bottom sections, identify the highest value (non-grey, non-black) present in that section. If there\\\\\\'s a tie for the highest value, the color that appears first when reading from left to right, top to bottom takes precedence. 3. In each section, replace all non-black and non-grey cells with black except for the cells corresponding to the highest value which are replaced with grey. 4. Leave the central bar of grey cells unchanged.    This should give you the correct transformation.\\\\n36. To make the output, you have to follow these steps:   - Maintain the row of grey boxes as it is. - For colored numbers not in the grey row, they are all changed to black except from numbers that are in the 6th and 10th positions. These positions take the color value from equivalent positions in the 1st row below the gray row (relative to their own gray row). In situations where the gray row is the last row, the numbers take the color value from equivalent positions in the 1st row above the gray row.\\\\n37. To make the output, you have to transform the upper half and lower half of the grid differently.   For the upper half, replace all cells that are not black or gray with black cells.   For the lower half, replace all cells that are not black or gray with black cells, except the cells that contain the highest number in each column, these should remain unchanged.   The middle line of gray cells should remain unchanged.\\\\n38. To make the output, locate the highest non-grey, non-black number in each 3x3 quadrant. Transform the respective 3x3 quadrants to all 0s, and replace the previous highest number with a 4. All grey line in-between should remain as is.\\\\n39. To create the output, you need to follow these steps: keep the grey lines and grey blocks as they are. For the colored blocks, keep them if and only if they have more than one appearance in their corresponding section. If a colored block appears only once in its section, it should be replaced with a grey block (number 5).\\\\n40. To make the output, you have to follow these steps:   retain the original grey horizontal lines in their exact location, but every other block in the grid should be painted black except for a single one in each of the three sections which should retain the highest value in the section in the input grid.  Take the section between the two grey lines, look for the highest numeric value (excluding the grey squares), then a square with the same value should be preserved in the output grid. The rest should be painted black. Repeat the step for the remaining two sections.\\\\n41. For each quadrant, keep only the colored square with the highest number, moving it to the center of the quadrant. Everything else (including the grey squares) remains the same.\\\\n42. The pattern of transformation from the input grid to the output can be observed in two steps: 1.\\\\t The grid size is unchanged .  2.   Vertical bands alternatively filled with zeros (black) and 5 (grey) are also unchanged. 3. \\\\t However, the colors displayed in the input image have been decreased in each band sandwiched between bands of 5s (greys) in the output. This means that when transforming from input to output, you simply maintain the grid size with its distribution of grey (5) bands, but reduce the colors on all other spots.   To determine what colour is reduced to, the colour that should replace each group of colours is found in an arrangement at the the edge of the group in the middle. These bands are then copied in the vertical direction, replacing the other numbers in the black vertical bands.  As an example, The output grid for the case from the group can go as follows:  - For the top group on input grid, we select the fourth row where 3 is the maximum colour coding. However, there are no spots\\\\n43. To transform the input into the output, look at the colored numbers in the row between and on the grey stripes. If a number is the greatest number in both the corresponding column and row (excluding number 5), keep it. If it is not, change it to 0. Kia all grey stripes the same. Any rows above the first stripe or below the last stripe become rows of 0s with a 5 in the fourth position.\\\\n44. To make the output, you have to turn all squares which are not grey to black in sections above and below the grey band. Then, for the middle square of each row in these sections, replace the black square with the maximum valued colored square originally present in the row. The grey band itself remains unchanged.\\\\n45. To make the output, keep the grey stripes as it is. In each color region - between two grey stripes, find the highest numbered color except the grey one. Replace rest all the colored cells with black. The highest numbered color should be replaced with corresponding numbered color in the output.\\\\n46. To make the output, for the areas outside the central gray square, you have to find the cell with the highest numbered color in each quadrant and fill the entire area of the same quadrant with that color (black if no colored cell is found) . Maintain all the colors in the gray square as they were in the input grid.\\\\n47. To create output from the grid, replace all the numbers (not on the central line) in the first four rows and first four columns of the input with 0. Then replace all the numbers (not on the central line) in the last four rows and last four columns of the input with 0. For the fifth and seventh rows and columns (except their intersection with the central line), copy the greatest number (if exists) from the corresponding column and row in the input grid. There is no change for the central line in the output grid.\\\\n48. To make the output, you have to check the color of the cell at the left and right side in the same row, if the cell at the left side is black, then preserve the color of the right cell in the center. If the cell of the right side is black, then preserve the color of the left cell in the center. If both the left and right side cells are black, then the center should be black. The color of the center from the input should be ignored. The grey lines dividing the grid remain unchanged.\\\\n49. To make the output, you have to clear all the other colored cells to black, in the input grid the colored cells that are equal or greater value than 5, alternating the cells from higher to lowest value, in the lower part of the grid. The cells will have descending values starting from the center and going outwards, alternating the cells in the quadrants that don\\\\\\'t include the green line. After this process has been completed, add 2x2 group of colored cells of the original color in the middle of the space cleared by this operation. The green lines should remain unchanged.\\\\n50. To make the output, you have to first get rid of the numbers that are not on the grey line (replace them with black cells).  And then find the highest number on each side of the grey line and replace the other numbers with black cells. Keep the grey line and the highest numbers on the sides.\\\\n51. To make the output, you have to keep the rows 4 and 8 as is and darken the rest by replacing each color cell that is not surrounded from its four sides by other color cells with purple.\\\\n52. To make the output, pick the highest number in each quadrant, excluding the number 5. Replace all other values (other than 5) with 0.  If there is no number other than 5 in a quadrant, fill the quadrant with 0s. The yellow line remains untouched.\\\\n53. To make the output, you have to first separate the original grid into four quadrants by two yellow rows filled with 5s. If a number inside each quadrant is the same as the number that meets the yellow border (on the right or down side of it) in the same row or column, replace that number by its original value in the output. Otherwise, replace it with 0. All other cells remain the same.\\\\n54. To make the output, you retain the blue horizontal line as is. For rows above and below the blue line, replace all colored cells (not black or blue) with black cells. Then, in the second cell of the first and third section, and the last cell of the second and fourth section, if they\\\\\\'re not blue or black, keep their color and copy it to its neighboring cells in the same section. Keep the rest of the cells in those sections as black. For all other cells which are not in the blue line or the mentioned cells\\\\\\' sections, keep them as black.\\\\n55. To make the output, you need to keep the full grey rows intact. For all other positions, if the cell in the input grid is black, make the corresponding cell in the output grid black as well. If it isn\\\\\\'t, check whether the same color appears again anywhere in the same column below the current cell but before the next grey row. If it does, make that cell in the output grid black otherwise copy the color.\\\\n56. To make the output, keep the 4th and 8th column as is. Reset the rest of the grid (all non-gray colours are reset to black). The highest numbers from the block diagonally targeting towards top-left of the grid (thus forming a \"\\\\\\\\\") is picked, if present, and placed in the starting block of the resultant \"\\\\\\\\\" target. If such highest number is not present, leave black. Leave the rest of the blocks in that section black. Maintain the rest of the grid as black. This process is repeated separately for each of the three sections.\\\\n57. To make the output, keep the grey rows (5) and black cells couldn\\\\\\'t change, change every non-black and non-grey cell in a quadrant the grid to the maximum number that appears in the corresponding quadrant of the input.\\\\n58. The transformation is achieved by comparing the top and bottom partitions divided by the rows of 5\\\\\\'s. For each corresponding square: if the top and bottom squares have the same color, the same color is maintained in the output. If the colors are different, the output displays the color with higher number. If either square is black(0), the output square becomes black as well. Line of 5\\\\\\'s, which divides the grid into two partitions, remains same in the output grid.\\\\n59. To make the output grid, you have to leave the grey lines (rows 4 and 8) and the black boxes untouched while turning all other colored boxes in the other lines into black. After this, examine the original inputs 1st, 5th, 7th and 11th rows. The last non-black box in each of these rows should be copied and placed in the same place in the corresponding rows of the output grid. The first row corresponds to the first row, the fifth to the fifth, and so on.\\\\n60. To make the output, you have to look at the three rows above and the three rows below each grey line. If a cell in these rows is the same colour as a cell in the corresponding row on the other side of the line, without considering the black cells, then copy that number to the output. The grey fives and all other numbers in the grey lines should be simply copied. All other cells are turned black.\\\\n61. To make the output, preserve gray strips on rows 4 and 8. For the remaining rows, keep the first three and the last three squares as they are. For the middle five squares: preserve the gray square and replace the squares to its left and right (if any) by the biggest value among the rest squares of the row. If there is no biggest value, replace the square by black (0).\\\\n62. To make the output, you have to transform the grid as per the following rules: - Keep the grey horizontal line as it is. - Change all other cells to black, except the cells containing color that are towards the farthest right in the input grid, above or below grey lines. - The chosen colored cells mentioned above (farthest right) should be placed to the farthest left in the output grid, above or below grey lines.

To make the output, you have to go over each cell from top to bottom, left to right. If the cell contains teal (8) and it is next to an empty cell (left, right, top, or bottom), change it to red (2). Otherwise, leave it as it is.\\\\n17. To make the output, you have to replace the teal color that is surrounded by a black on both left and right sides to red. The rest of the grid remains the same.\\\\n18. To make the output, you should apply the following steps: For each cell in the input grid that is colored, check the cell to the immediate right of it. If this cell is uncolored, then the cell in the output corresponding to the original colored cell should also come out colored. However, the output color should be a dark pink, rather than light sea green. For any cell in the input grid that is uncolored, or any light sea green cell that has another light sea green cell to its immediate right, the corresponding output cell should remain uncolored.\\\\n19. To make the output, you have to find low salience (less prominent) regions inside the teal shapes, and recolor them with the color red \\\\\\'2\\\\\\'. Salience can be defined as whether a digit is surrounded by the same color from all four sides (top, bottom, left, and right). If the teal \\\\\\'8\\\\\\' digit is not surrounded by other teal \\\\\\'8\\\\\\' digits from all four sides, it\\\\\\'s considered low salience and should be turned red in the output.\\\\n20. To make the output, you have to identify every cell in the shape that is surrounded by 3 teal pixels (including diagonals). Change the color of those cells from teal to red (2). All other cells should stay the same.\\\\n21. To transform the grid, follow a rule that applies to cells of value 8. If there\\\\\\'s a cell with value 8 with no 8 value cell below it, then change the cell value to 2. This rule applies no matter where the cell in question is located. So, in effect, any teal cell that does not have another teal cell directly beneath it should be changed to red in the output.\\\\n22. To transform the input into the output, change any teal cell (8) that\\\\\\'s surrounded by black cells (0) on both the left and right into a red cell (2). Keep all other cells the same color. The new color (red, or 2) represents any teal (8) pixels that are \"isolated\" with no adjacent teal pixels to their sides. In other words, take all the teal cells that are not part of a horizontal line of teal cells and change their color to red.\\\\n23. To make the output, you have to identify all inward facing edges of the object, and redraw them with the number 2. By inward facing, it means that to one side of this edge (specifically, to its top right) is the outer black area and to its other sides (bottom left) is part of the object body. This gives the object a new edge/outline with number 2.\\\\n24. To make the output, you should start by copying the input to the output. Then, for each teal cell in the output, examine its horizontally and vertically adjacent neighbors (excluding diagonals). If any of these neighbors is black, change the teal cell into red (number 2). The black cells remain unchanged.\\\\n25. To make the output, you have to change the aqua-colored (8) pixels that are surrounded by black (0) pixels on all four sides (up, down, left, and right) into red (2). All other aqua-colored pixels should remain unchanged.\\\\n26. To transform the input into the output, follow these steps. Take the figure in the input grid, maintain the border of the figure as teal (8). For the internal cells of the figure which are not enclosed by teal cells on all four sides (left, right, up, down), turn them from either black or teal to red (2). The red cells are places where potentially a part is \"cut out\" from the original figure.\\\\n27. To make the output, you have to change the teal of a cell to red if it has more black neighbors than teal ones. The neighbors of a cell are the 8 cells which share at least one corner with it. Corners of the grid with only 3 neighbors are considered to only have 2 black neighbors. Edges of the grid are also treated differently, with 3 black neighbors being assumed by default. The remaining sides and the center follow the rule above.\\\\n28. To make the output, you have to change the color of the cell to red wherever the cells below and to the right of it are both teal, otherwise let the cell remain the same color.\\\\n29. To make the output, you have to examine the cells which are originally colored. If the colored cell (number 8) is surrounded by at least 3 other colored cells (including diagonals), leave it as it is. If the colored cell is surrounded by less than 3 colored cells, change its color to red (represented by number 2).\\\\n30. To make the output, you have to change the color of the teal (8) pixels that are surrounded by at least three sides by black (0) pixels to red (2). Pixels at the edge of the grid are considered surrounded if they have black pixels or the edge of the grid on three sides.\\\\n31. To transform the input into the output, replace all teal 8\\\\\\'s outside of the numeral with red 2\\\\\\'s. So here, the numeral is considered to be the area where the color is fully surrounded by the same color. The remaining sections of teal 8\\\\\\'s that are not fully enclosed will be replaced by red 2\\\\\\'s.\\\\n32. To make the output, all the teal cells that are directly connected to black cells on their right side should be transformed into red ones. It\\\\\\'s like the \\\\\\'8\\\\\\' is shining red light only on its left side. Keep in mind that diagonal connections don\\\\\\'t count, only direct right-side adjacent connections do.\\\\n33. To make the output, firstly scan through the grid cell by cell. You have to change the color of the cell horizontally inside the \\\\\\'8\\\\\\' shape from teal (8) to red (2). That is, each teal-colored cell (8) that has a teal-colored cell to its right and left, transform it to red color. The rest of the grid remains unchanged.\\\\n34. To make the output, you have to replace every teal pixel that\\\\\\'s surrounded by at least 3 sides by black with red. If the pixel\\\\\\'s right, left and down sides are black, or if the left, up and down sides are black, or if the right, up and left sides are black, or if the right, down and up sides are black, the pixel color should be changed to red. The other pixels should remain unchanged.\\\\n35. In this transformation, consider the black cells as gaps and the teal cells as solids. Look at each row in the input grid. If the row has teal cells and the next cell to the right is a black cell (gap), replace this black cell with a red digit \\\\\\'2\\\\\\'. Continue this process until you hit another teal cell. Leave the first and last cells of each row as they are (if they are black cells).\\\\n36. To make the output, you have to look at each column of the grid. Replace all the teal squares in a column with red squares until you reach the first black square from the top in each column. Leave all the other squares the same.\\\\n37. To make the output, you have to replace the teal (number 8) boxes that don\\\\\\'t have a neighbouring teal box on their left or right with a red box (number 2). Please note that the checking for teal box on their left or right applies to edges cases as well. If a teal box is on the left or right edge and has no other teal box immediately next to it, replace it with red. The teal boxes that are connected with at least one other teal box to their immediate left or right retain their teal color. This rule applies individually to every row. No vertical comparisons are required.\\\\n38. To make the output, you have to replace the left half of the filled horizontal lines in the original teal shape with red. The teal \\\\\\'line\\\\\\' on the extreme left should always remain teal, and the changes should be made starting from the immediate line next to it.\\\\n39. To make the output, you have to identify teal squares that are not surrounded on all four sides (up, down, left, right) by at least one other teal square (diagonals do not count). These teal squares should be changed to red in the output grid. All other teal squares remain teal. All other colors (black in this case) remain as is in the output.\\\\n40. The transformation involves changing the color of the cells inside of the \"8\" shape but not on its perimeter. The \"8\" cells on the perimeter stay the same while the \"8\" cells inside the shape change their color to \"2\". Cells that are surrounded by \"8\" cells or \"0\" cells remain as \"0\".\\\\n41. To make the output, you need to replace every teal cell for which at least one black neighbor exists to the top, left, right, or below it with red cells. In other words, change the border element of the shape to red. Neighbor cells diagonally are not considered.\\\\n42. To make the output, you have to change teal cells in the input grid to red if they are horizontally adjacent to the black cell(s). This transformation depends on the horizontal adjacency, not the vertical or diagonal adjacency.\\\\n43. To make the output, you have to fill the black boxes on the row above, below and diagonally to the right of a teal box with red. Practically, if a teal box \\\\\\'sees\\\\\\' a black box along these directions, turn that box into red. Do not change the teal boxes or the boxes which can\\\\\\'t be \\\\\\'seen\\\\\\'.\\\\n44. To make the output, you have to change the value of all the teal cells that are surrounded by at least three teal cells to red. And the teal cells that are on the outer edge remains the same.\\\\n45. To make the output, you should locate the maze paths and replace the teal cells on the left-hand path with a red color (number 2) until reaching the center of the \\\\\\'8\\\\\\' figure. It seems like you\\\\\\'re coloring half of the left path of the maze-like \\\\\\'8\\\\\\' figure with the color red while maintaining the other half and the right path in teal color.\\\\n46. The transformation involves   1. Identifying a pattern where a teal cell (represented by value 8) is \\\\\\'isolated\\\\\\', i.e., it is surrounded by black cells (value 0) in the top, bottom, left, and right cells. Also, it doesn\\\\\\'t count if the pattern is at the edge of the grid.   2. If the pattern is identified, the isolated teal cell is turned into a red cell (represented by value 2).   3. The rest of the cells including the black (0) and the the non-isolated teal (8) cells remain unchanged.\\\\n47. To make the output, you have to replace the number 8 cells that have no immediate 8 cells around them (up, down, left, right) with number 2 cells (displayed in red). The positions of the original \"8\" cells that have at least one immediate \"8\" cell neighbor remain the same. All black cells stay the same.\\\\n48. To make the output, you should replace the black (value 0) cells inside the number \"8\" shape with red (value 2). Leave the cells outside the number \"8\" shape and the cells which together form the number \"8\" (teal cells, value 8) as they are.\\\\n49. To form the output grid, you need to first identify the teal shape(s) in the input grid. In the shape, for each cell that is not in the outermost outline of the shape (that is, each cell that has teal cells on all of its four sides) change the color from teal to red. The outline of the shape remains unchanged as teal. Black cells that are not part of the shape also remain unchanged.\\\\n50. To make the output, you have to evaluate the teal shapes in the input grid square by square. If the teal square at position (i, j) is the only teal square among its eight neighbors - position (i-1,j-1), (i-1,j), (i-1,j+1), (i,j-1), (i,j+1), (i+1,j-1), (i+1,j), (i+1,j+1) - convert it into a red square. If it is not the only teal square among its neighbors, keep it as a teal square.\\\\n51. To make the output, you need to identify the shape formed by the teals (number 8). Next is to locate any cells within that shape that are not occupied by a teal. Then, the transformation process is changing these unoccupied cells within the shape to red (number 2), and also change cells directly adjacent to them (up, down, left, right, but not diagonal) inside the shape to red.\\\\n52. To make the output, you have to replace empty black cells to red when the black cell is surrounded by teal on three sides forming a \\\\\\'L\\\\\\' shape (either to the left or to the right).\\\\n53. Transform the input grid by observing the teal-colored cells. If a teal cell is isolated (surrounded by black cells from all 4 sides - top, right, bottom, and left), color it red. If a teal cell has no direct coverage of teal cells on any two adjacent sides out of the four: top, right, bottom, and left; also color it red. Maintain all the other cells as they were in the input grid to form the output grid.\\\\n54. To create the output grid, you replace every cell that is black (0) in the input grid and is surrounded by teal (8) color cells on the left and right sides with a red (2) cell. The other cells remain the same as in the input grid.\\\\n55. To make the output, you have to change all the black cells surrounded by teal cells into red cells. A cell is considered to be surrounded by teal cells if it has at least three teal neighbors.\\\\n56. To generate the output grid, identify the blue cells that lack a neighboring blue cell to the right or below (considering immediate adjacency only). Replace these blue cells with red (2) whilst leaving every other cell the same color as it was in the input grid. This effectively applies a red outline to the right and bottom edges of the blue shapes in the input.\\\\n57. The transformation involves replacing each black square adjacent to only teal squares with a red square, but only if it\\\\\\'s part of a diagonal (either from top left to bottom right or top right to bottom left) inside a shape (a complete or incomplete square made of teal squares). Note that each shape doesn\\\\\\'t rotate or move and that the transformation doesn\\\\\\'t affect the black squares outside of the shapes.\\\\n58. To make the output, you need to locate the teal colored shapes and check whether they are surrounded by black cells from all four adjacent sides (top, right, bottom, left.). If a teal colored cell has black cells on its top, bottom, left, and right, it keeps its color. However, if a teal colored cell is adjacent diagonally only to another teal colored cell or black cell, change it into red (represented by 2). If it is connected to another teal cell on its left, right, top, or bottom it keeps its color.\\\\n59. To make the output, you have to color the cells that are directly to the left or bottom of an empty cell (except if the empty cell is on the border of the grid) and that are teal in the input, red in the output.\\\\n60. To make the output, you have to replace the \"8\" position which has two adjacent \"0\" positions (up, down, left, or right) with red color represented by the number \"2\". Keep in mind that adjacent \"0\" should be immediate next to \"8\" in vertical or horizontal direction and diagonal adjacency does not count.\\\\n61. To make the output, for every teal square (number 8) treat it as a focal point. For each teal square, look to its north, south, east, and west. If any of these adjacent squares are black (number 0), change that teal square to red (number 2) without affecting the surrounding squares.\\\\n62. To make the output, you have to change every third teal cell (starting from the first teal cell in every row) to red. iterate over each row from left to right and every teal cell should be transformed to red if the number of the existing teal cells before it (inclusive) is divisible by 3.\\\\n63. To make the output, you have to change the teal spots to red spots if they do not vertically or horizontally touch any other teal spots, but keep them teal if they are touched by another teal spot on any side.\\\\n64. To transform the input grid into the output grid, you change the color of the teal pixesl that do not have any other teal pixels at their sides (up, down, left, or right, just the direct sides, not diagonal) to red. All other colors stay the same.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "Category 1: Rules that involve changing teal cells to red based on their position within a larger teal shape or digit.\n- Synthesized Rule: To make the output, identify the teal cells that are part of a larger teal shape or digit.

For each category, synthesize the rules into a single, specific rule that combines the ideas of all rules in that category, while clearly differentiating it from the other categories.\\\\nThe new rule should be as specific as possible, following the format of the given rules.\\\\nThe new rule should be applicable without any information from the original rules - i.e. it should be standalone.\\\\n\\\\nRules:\\\\n1. To make the output, you have to color the square gray if the corresponding square in the input grid has the most frequent color in the input grid; otherwise, color it black. If there are multiple colors that are the most frequent ones, consider the lowest value color. So if there are more green squares than red squares in the original 3x3 grid, color the corresponding output square gray, else color it black.\\\\n2. The transformation from input to output seems to consist of two steps:  1) Compare every position in the 3x3 matrix. If the number in a particular position matches the number below it (i.e., in the next row but same column), replace it with a 5.  2) If the number doesn\\\\\\'t match the one below it (or in the case of the bottom row, since there\\\\\\'s no row below), replace the number with 0.   This creates diagonal stripes of 5s, effectively rewarding matches with the position below within the original matrix.\\\\n3. To transform the input grid to the output, you first identify the color (or in this case, digit/number) that appears less frequently in the input grid (if all colors/numbers appear the same amount of times, pick any). In the output grid, replace every cell that matches this color in the input with grey. Then, any cell which is not grey in the output will correspond to the first non-matching cell with the same color in the input reading in rows from left to right, starting from top. Essentially, it\\\\\\'s a game of seeking the first matching cell per row. If there\\\\\\'s no matching color in that row, the output cell stays black.\\\\n4. To make the output, you have to check if the diagonal going from the top left corner to the bottom right corner of the 3x3 grid in the input is filled with the same color. If it is, then fill this same diagonal in the output with grey boxes (5) and the rest of the squares with black boxes (0). If it is not the same color in the input diagonal, then fill the output diagonal starting from the top right to the bottom left with grey boxes, the rest with black boxes.\\\\n5. To make the output, you have to find the color that appears the most in the grid. Then, start from the top left cell and replace it with grey if that cell has the most appearing color, otherwise, replace it with black. Repeat this process for each cell from top to bottom, left to right.\\\\n6. To make the output, you have to compare the color of the boxes. If a box is the same color as the box directly below and to the right of it, color the box grey. If a box is not the same color as the box directly below and to the right of it, color the box black. If a box has no other boxes to compare, fill it with grey.\\\\n7. The output is created by taking the element from the diagonal of the input grid from top left to bottom right and make them gray. The anti-diagonal (from top right to bottom left) elements should be made black. The rest of the elements maintain their colors.\\\\n8. The pattern appears to compare the numbers in the diagonal from the top left to the bottom right of the grid with the value in the center cell. If the diagonal value matches the center value, a new value of 5 is assigned to that cell in the output. If the diagonal value does not match the center value, the cell is assigned a value of 0 in the output. This condition is applied cell by cell in the diagonal, whereas the remaining cells (other than the diagonal and center) keep the value from the input grid.\\\\n9. Each row in the output grid corresponds to a row in the input grid. The transformation requires scanning each row from left to right. If you find a red cell in an input row, set the corresponding cell in the output row to grey. If you don\\\\\\'t, set the entire output row to grey. For the first grey cell in each output row, set the cells on its right to black.\\\\n10. The transformation is to count each color of cells(red, green and yellow) in the input (ignoring black cells) . The most frequently occurring color in the input grid is replaced by grey (5) in the output grid, the other two colors are replaced by black (0). If the frequency of two or more colors is the same, then replace all colors with grey (5) and the remaining places with black (0).\\\\n11. To make the output, you have to rearrange the values based on how many times they appear in the grid. The color, which appears most of the time in the grid (based on RGB code), replaces all boxes with 5 (grey) in the output. If a value only appears once or twice, its position flips diagonally from its original position in the 3x3 grid. If a color appears three times, its positions are replaced with 0 (black) in the output grid.\\\\n12. The central red cell is depicted as grey in the output. Each row in the output has only one grey cell, and these grey cells move from the left side of the row to the right side as we go from top to bottom, diagonally. Black cells are used to fill the remaining spaces in each row.\\\\n13. To make the output, you have to check the colors of the diagonals from top left to bottom right. If this diagonal is all red (2), you place grey cells (number 5) on its place. If the diagonal is all green (3) or all yellow (4), you also replace it with grey (5). For all other cells not on the main diagonal, turn them into black ones (0).\\\\n14. To make the output, you have to count the individual colors in each column. If the column is dominated by red color (more red than other colors), then the corresponding output\\\\\\'s diagonal will transform into a dominant color, grey in the first column, changes as you go down the diagonal from top-left to bottom-right. Yet, if green and red are both present, then green takes priority and the diagonal will be grey until the third row where it starts again. In cases where column contains the same amount of red and green or blue, then all cells in that column belong to gray. If all boxes in a column are blue then, the color will be grey in the output. If there is no dominant color, then the output\\\\\\'s diagonal changes as you go down the diagonal from top-left to bottom-right where it starts again.\\\\n15. To make the output, you have to perform the following operations. The first is to examine the diagonals in both directions. If in a diagonal all cells are of the same color, then keep the diagonal cells as color gray in the output grid and fill the rest with black; otherwise, color each cell of the primary diagonal (from top left to bottom right) as gray and the rest of the cells as black.\\\\n16. To make the output, you have to replace the red cells in the input grid with grey cells in the output. Then, fill the diagonal cells starting from the top left to the bottom right with grey cells. The remaining cells, fill with black cells. If the entire 3x3 grid input is just one color, then replace it all with grey in the output and the two last lines of the column should be black.\\\\n17. To make the output, you have to transform the color red into color grey. The color blue should not be present in the output. If it is present in the input, replace it with a red box in the output. Similarly remove any green box and place it in the output where the blue colour was. Finally, replace any black box in the input with a grey colored box in the output.\\\\n18. To make the output, you have to identify the color of the cells in the top row and if they all are the same, then fill the diagonal cells from the top left to the bottom right with gray. For the remaining cells, if the top row cells in the input grid are all fuchsia, fill them with black, else if they are green, just leave them as it is (already filled with black).\\\\n19. To make the output, you have to count the number of colored cells in the input grid that are not red (2). If the count of non-red cells is greater, replace all the cells in upper row with GRAY (5). If the count of non-red cells is lesser, replace all the cells in the lower row with GRAY (5). If the counts are equal, replace both upper and lower rows with GRAY (5). Always replace the middle row in the output grid with BLACK (0).\\\\n20. To make the output, you need to transform the grid horizontally by replacing the evaluated cells with a color represented by a number. If all cells in the row contain the same color, replace them with grey cells represented by number 5. If a row has more than one color, then transform the middle cell into a grey cell and the remaining cells to black. The top row should be evaluated bottom-up, the middle row left-to-right, and the bottom row right-to-left.\\\\n21. To generate the output grid from the input, the following steps are performed. 1. Check each cell in the grid from left to right and top to bottom.  2. If the number in the cell matches the number in the center cell of the grid, change it to 5 (grey).  3. If the number in the cell doesn\\\\\\'t match the number in the center cell, change it to 0 (black).  The operation is applied on all 3x3 grids given in each case.\\\\n22. To make the output, you should focus on the colored square at the center of the input grid. Change all the squares in that color to grey in the output grid. Then turn every other square into black except the diagonal line from the top left to the bottom right, which should be turned into grey. The sequence of the diagonal line from top left to bottom right corresponds with the sequence of colored squares from top to bottom in the input grid.\\\\n23. To make the output, you have to turn the place where there was red into grey. Then, if you find the same color in the same row, turn it into black. If you find the same color in the same column, turn it into grey. If the color does not exist anywhere else in the grid, leave it as it is.\\\\n24. To make the output, start by replacing all occurrences of color 2 (red) with color 5 (grey). Then, the transformation rule seems to be an operation of inverting the matrix along the main diagonal. Therefore, the output grid values are the input values reflected along the main diagonal.\\\\n25. To make the output, you have to apply a direction and color-coded rule: all cells that are in the same row or column as the blue cell turn into grey, otherwise stay black. Now move from left to right and top to bottom, fill grey on the cells which previously had a different color than blue.\\\\n26. The transformation rule involves comparing each cell in the input matrix with the center cell (2,2) in the input grid. If the color of a cell matches the color of the center cell in the input grid, then it should be changed to grey in the output grid. If it doesn\\\\\\'t match, then it remains black. The center square in the output grid is always grey.\\\\n27. To make the output, you look at the center square of the grid and identify its color. If the input color is Red (2), the output will have Grey(5), Blue(1), and Black(0) diagonally from top left to down right. And if the input is Green (3) or Yellow (4), the output will be the other way around with Grey, Blue, and Black diagonally from top right to down left. All remaining squares will be Black.\\\\n28. To make the output, you have to apply the following steps: Define the centre of a 3 (e.g. 2nd row, 2nd column, 1-indexed) as the major color of the last row and put this color at the center. Set the other two corners of the main diagonal to be the same color. After that, fill the remaining cells with black.\\\\n29. To make the output, check the color (or the number) in the central cell in the input. A gray cell is placed in the output grid where the the same color (or represented number) appears in the input grid, the rest are black cells. If the central cell is red (2), all the red cells in the input become gray cells in the output and all others turn black. Same applies if the color is green (3) or yellow (4) in the central cell.\\\\n30. To make the output, first identify the color in the center of the grid from the input, this will be our reference color. For each square in the output, if the corresponding square in the input matches the reference color then the output square should be gray, otherwise it should be black. The centers of both the input and output grids will always be gray.\\\\n31. To make the output, look at the color that appears in the majority of the rows. If a cell in the output grid corresponds to a cell of the majority color in the input, make it grey. Otherwise, it should remain black. The cells should be filled in a top-to-bottom, left-to-right diagonal pattern.\\\\n32. The transformation involves changing the configuration of colored squares within the grid:  1. If the middle square in the input is Red and all squares are the same color in the input, then in the output, replace all squares with Grey, and turn the three squares along the leading diagonal (from top left to bottom right) Black.  2. If the middle square in the input is Red and all squares are not the same color in the input, then in the output, turn the three squares along the leading diagonal (from top right to bottom left) Grey; all other squares should be Black.  3. If the middle square in the input is Green and all squares are the same color in the input, then in the output, make all squares Grey and the three squares along the leading diagonal (from top left to bottom right) Black.  4. If the middle square in the input is Green, and all squares are not the same color in the input, then in the output, place the three squares along the leading diagonal (from top left to bottom right) Grey; all other squares should be\\\\n33. To make the output, the transform is conducted based on a fixed pattern. The cells in the main diagonal (from top left to bottom right) are transformed to grey color, represented by the digit five. The remaining cells are turned into black, represented by the digit zero. However, if the input grid contains two different colors, the colors are converted to black and grey following the \"X\" pattern diagonally where it tends to form an \"X\" figure. The color closer to the center of the grid (top right to bottom left) is converted to grey, while the remaining colors are converted to black.\\\\n34. Transform the input grid to the output grid by replacing red squares with grey. If the square is green or purple, replace it with a white square if it\\\\\\'s located in the lower left to upper right diagonal, otherwise replace it with a black square.\\\\n35. To make the output, you have to follow several steps. For each square, look at the column and diagonals that the square belongs to. If the square has the same color as the rest of the squares in the row, the corresponding square in the output should be gray. If that is not the case, the corresponding output square is black.\\\\n36. To make the output, you have to identify the dominant color in the grid i.e., if the grid has more yellow or green. If yellow outnumbers green or is equal, the output grid follows the pattern: [[5 0 0]  [0 5 0]  [0 0 5]] where 5 represents grey.   If green outnumbers yellow, the output grid follows the pattern: [[0 0 5]  [0 5 0]  [5 0 0]].  Ignore the red color in the grid for this calculation. It does not influence the output.\\\\n37. To make the output, you have to perform an operation on the rows of the input grid:  - If a row consists of different colors blocks then in the respective row in the output, the diagonal should consist of 5s (grey) and the rest should be black.  - If a row in the input grid is composed of blocks of the same color, then in the respective row in the output, should consist entirely of 5s (grey).\\\\n38. To make the output, you have to check each row in the input. If a row only contains one color, color the equivalent row in the output entirely gray. If a row contains multiple colors, set the cell with color \\\\\\'2\\\\\\' (red on the input) to gray on output and rest to black on output, forming a diagonal line from top left to bottom right.\\\\n39. - Locate the cell in the input with the value 2 (Red colored cell).  - In the output, fill a number 5 (grey cell) diagonally starting from the first cell to until you reach the same position as 2 in input.  - The cell in the output that aligns with position of 2 in input should receive 5, and other cells in line should get 0 (Black). - For all the other cells not in line with the diagonal, fill with 0 (Black).   This transformation reflects a diagonal line starting from the upper left (1st cell) and running to the lower right, and placing the 5 (grey) cell in the same row/column as cell 2 (red) in the input. The remaining cells are all black (0).\\\\n40. To create the output grid, first, find the color or number that appears most often in the input grid. If a cell contains this color or number, change it to a 5 (grey). If not, change it to a 0 (black). Furthermore, place these numbers in a diagonal starting from top-left to bottom-right, filling the rest of the cells as 0 (black).\\\\n41. To make the output, you need to look at the grid row by row. For the row that has a clear dominant color (which is the color that is different from the colors in the other two rows), all cells in the row should be transformed to \\\\\\'5\\\\\\' (grey). For the other two rows with matching colors, all of the cells should be \\\\\\'0\\\\\\' (black). However, each row should have one cell transformed to \\\\\\'5\\\\\\' (gray), forming a diagonal line from the top left to bottom right of the grid.\\\\n42. To make the output, you have to check if there are more green squares than red or yellow squares on the input grid. If so, the output should be a gray diagonal line starting from the top left to the bottom right on a black background. If not, the output should be a gray diagonal line starting from the top right to the bottom left on a black background. If all squares in the input grid are the same color, only the top row in the output grid should contain gray squares, and the rest should be black.\\\\n43. To form the output grid, we should look for the presence of specific colors in the input grid. If we see a red block anywhere in the input grid, then the top left square of the output grid should be filled with grey. If a green block is present then the middle square should be filled with grey and if there is a yellow block then bottom right square becomes grey. If there are no blocks of a certain color, then the corresponding area in the output grid should be filled with black. This process is to be followed from left to right and from top to diagonal in the output grid.\\\\n44. To transform the grid, firstly check if the center square is red in the input. If it is, based on the positions of the green squares in the input, put down gray squares in the corresponding positions of the output and the remaining squares should be black. Conversely, if the center square isn\\\\\\'t red, based on the positions of the yellow squares in the input, put down gray squares in the corresponding positions of the output and the remaining squares should be black.\\\\n45. To make the output, you have to insert a grey cell if the cell in the same position in the input grid is blue. If it is green or red, check if there are more red cells or green cells in the input grid. If there are more red cells, turn the cell grey. If there are more green cells, keep the cell black. If there is a tie, keep the cell black as well.\\\\n46. To make the output, you have to check the middle row of the input grid. If the middle square is blue, replace all of the blue squares in the resulting grid with grey. If the middle square is not blue, place a grey square in the diagonal from the top-left to the bottom-right of the output grid, and fill the rest with black.\\\\n47. For an input cell that contains the number 2, replace this with the number 5 in the output cell that is diagonally across the grid. If the input cell is in the corner, place the 5 in the diagonally opposite corner of the output. If the input cell is in the centre, place the 5 in the same position in the output.  For an input cell that contains the number 3 or 4, replace this with the number 0 in the output.\\\\n48. To create the output, locate the color that appears most frequently in the input grid. In the output, fill in all cells that were a different color with \\\\\\'5\\\\\\', and the cells that had the most frequent color, fill with \\\\\\'0\\\\\\'. Create a diagonal of \\\\\\'5\\\\\\' from the top-left to the bottom-right of the output grid, regardless of their original color in the input.\\\\n49. To make the output, check if the colors in the grid are the same or different.  If all colors are the same, the corresponding output grid will be two rows of grey on top and one black row at the bottom. But if there are two different colors on the grid, then the output will be a diagonal sequence of grey cells from top left to bottom right with black cells filling the rest.\\\\n50. To make the output, identify the color that appears most in the input grid. Then in the respective output grid fill the diagonal boxes, from top-left to bottom-right, with gray (which is represented by number 5) and the remaining boxes with black. If all the colors in the input grid appear equal number of times, then still the the diagonal boxes in the output grid from top-left to bottom-right should be filled with gray and the remaining ones with black.\\\\n51. To make the output, you have to create a diagonal from top-left to bottom-right. If there is any red cell in the input grid diagonally then it should be replaced by grey (from 2 to 5), the rest of the cells should be black (from any to 0) regardless of their positions in diagonal. If there is no red cell in the input grid, then all cells in the output should be grey (from any to 5). Reports can be rewritten as: a) replace 2 with 5 in diagonal from top-left to bottom-right. b) replace number with 0 if not on the diagonal. c) replace any number with 5 if no 2 in the input.\\\\n52. The entire grid is shifted diagonally to the right. The cells that fall out of the grid on the right side reappear on the left side. In the resulting grid, replace the blue cells with gray, and the red and green cells with black cells.\\\\n53. To make the output, you first need to create a copy of the input grid. Then find the number that occurs the most in the input. In the output grid, change any cell containing this number to Grey (5). All other cells not containing the number that appears the most often in the input, should be changed to Black (0). The final step is to rotate the new grid by 90 degrees counter clockwise.\\\\n54. To make the output, you have to identify the most frequent color other than red. All non-red cells should be transformed to this color if they are not of this color already whereas all red cells should be transformed to grey. If all non-red cells have different colors, then transform them to the color of the last row and column (the color which is at the bottom right most cell of the input grid).\\\\n55. To make the output, firstly scan the grid diagnolly from top-left to bottom-right. If you encounter the number 2 replace it with 5. When you encounter the number 3 or 4 replace them with 0. For all the remaining cells, go diagnolly from top-right to bottom-left. Here, replace the number 2 with 0 and number 3 or 4 with 5.\\\\n56. To make the output, you have to look at the center square of the input grid. If the middle square of the input grid is colored as 2, then create a grey diagonal from top left to bottom right in the output grid.  The rest of the grid cells will be black.\\\\n57. To make the output, you have to rotate the entire grid 45 degrees counterclockwise and then replace the diagonal that was originally from top-right to bottom-left with grey, and set the remaining cells to black.\\\\n58. To make the output, you have to turn all the cells in the first row and the main diagonal starting from the top left corner into gray cells. Leave all other cells as black. If there is a red cell at any location on the main diagonal, then turn the entire column of that location into gray except for the main diagonal cell itself.\\\\n59. To make the output, you have to place grey squares in the positions where red was in the input, and the rest should be filled with black squares. The grid is also flipped diagonally from bottom-left to top-right.\\\\n60. To make the output:  1. For the cell at row R and column C in the input matrix, look at the cell in the Rth column and Cth row of the matrix. 2. If it\\\\\\'s red, set the output cell at row R and column C to grey. 3. If it\\\\\\'s not red, set it to black.\\\\n61. To make the output, count the amount of different colors in the input grid, and if there is only one color fill the whole grid in gray. If there are two colors, copy the position of the color that appears less frequently and paint it gray in the output. For the other cells, paint it black. If there are three colors, make a diagonal line from top left to bottom right in gray, the upper right corner will be black and  the lower left corner will be black as well.\\\\n62. To make the output, you have to rotate the original colors (red, green, yellow boxes) in a clockwise rotation in the output. The first row of the input becomes the third column in the output, the second row becomes the second column, and the third row becomes the first column. All the colors are rotated to gray in the output except for red that turns to gray.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "Category 1: Rules based on the most frequent color\n1.

For each category, synthesize the rules into a single, specific rule that combines the ideas of all rules in that category, while clearly differentiating it from the other categories.\\\\nThe new rule should be as specific as possible, following the format of the given rules.\\\\nThe new rule should be applicable without any information from the original rules - i.e. it should be standalone.\\\\n\\\\nRules:\\\\n1. To make the output, you need to mirror the color pattern found in the input along the right vertical axis of the 10x10 grid. Specifically, if a colored shape is encountered in the input, a mirror image of that shape will be drawn on the right side of the grid in the output. The mirror action is realized by rotating each row on the horizontal axis, keeping the colors.\\\\n2. To produce the output grid, the pattern consists in rotating the square by 180 degrees about the center of the grid.\\\\n3. To make the output, you should move the top left square to the center of the grid and transform it into a diamond shape, and the bottom left square to the left side with its right side attached to the middle column of the grid and transform it into a triangle. The shape\\\\\\'s individual cells should move as a whole without any rotation. The shape\\\\\\'s transformation does not depend on the size or shape of the original figure: triangles transform into diamonds, and squares transform into triangles. The color remains the same.\\\\n4. To make the output, you have to reflect the \"L\"-shaped sequences over a diagonal line extended from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner. The top-left \"L\"-shape moves to the bottom-left and the bottom-right \"L\"-shape moves to the top-right. Leave the black cells as they are.\\\\n5. To make the output, you need to mirror the existing elements diagonally from top left to bottom right. So every point (x,y) is mirrored to (y,x). Hence, the L-shaped elements from the upper right and lower left corners from the input are mirrored towards the middle of grid in the output. The L-shape remains oriented the same way during the mirroring.\\\\n6. To make the output, you have to copy the top right part of the small square of the colored boxes from the input and paste it in the middle-left part of the output grid. Similarly, copy the top-left part of the small square and paste it in the middle-right part of the output grid. The rest of the grid will remain same as that of the input.\\\\n7. Each colored cross on the input grid, when rotated 45 degrees clockwise, turns into a diamond shape on the output grid. The orientation of the cross on the input determines the location of the diamond on the output. The color of the diamond on the output matches the color of the cross on the input.\\\\n8. To make the output, rotate the entire middle segment composed by filled cells 90 degrees counter-clockwise, preserving the center of rotation. The colored points should rotate around the point that is in the middle of the figure. All other aspects of the grid remain unchanged.\\\\n9. To make the output, take the existing colored boxes and reproduce them in a mirrored fashion across the vertical line through the center of the grid.\\\\n10. To make the output, you have to identify where the colored shapes are and denote them. Then, replicate these colored squares Symmetrically along the diagonal of the grid from upper left to lower right. This means a mirrored version of these colored shapes should appear on the other side of this diagonal. They should be at a distance from the diagonal equal to their distance in the input grid.\\\\n11. To make the output, you should locate the two L-shaped configurations and identify their common vertex point. Then, you should mirror these L-shapes along a diagonal line going through this central point, causing the L-shapes to rotate 45 degrees clockwise. More specifically:  1. Identify the two existing L-shapes and their common vertex point. 2. Mirror each cell of the L-shapes along the diagonal that crosses the common vertex. This will move each cell to a new position where the old row number becomes the new column number, and the old column number becomes the new row number. 3. This generates a new set of L-shapes rotated 45 degrees clockwise relative to the original ones. The new cells should have the same color as the original cells. 4. All other cells (i.e., the ones not belonging to the L-shapes) keep their original color.\\\\n12. To make the output, you mirror the top half of the grid along the vertical axis of symmetry that passes through the middle of the grid. Do the same for the bottom half, but excludes the middle row if the total number of rows is odd. This mirror image replaces the top/bottom half of the grid respectively. The middle row remains the same.\\\\n13. To make the output, you have to rotate the whole grid 90 degrees counterclockwise. The L-shaped figure keeps its original position relative to the center and always rotates counterclockwise. A 90 degrees counterclockwise rotation needs to be made in order to create the output from the input.\\\\n14. To make the output, you have to rotate the squares that are not black by 90 degrees counterclockwise around the center of the grid. All black squares remain in place.\\\\n15. The pattern for transforming each grid is a simple reflection about a vertical axis in the middle of the grid.\\\\n16. To make the output, you have to mirror the pattern of the orange (7) or brown (9) numbers diagonally from top left to bottom right. To do this, you copy each colored cell to the cell that has the same distance to the diagonal, but on the other side of it. This mirrors the pattern along the diagonal line.\\\\n17. To make the output, you have to take any color besides black and push them across the grid diagonally right and down. You should only keep the existing colors if they are along the same row. If there\\\\\\'s no colored elements, then the grid remains unchanged.\\\\n18. To transform the grid, mirror the orange or brown figure(s) from the input across the center line of the 10x10 grid. The mirror-image should lie along the reversed direction.\\\\n19. To make the output, you have to rotate the entire grid (except the parts that are entirely black) 45 degrees clockwise. In the new output, add a number that is the same as the numbers in the triangle to make it a diagonal line, while everything else remains black.\\\\n20. To make an output, you have to mirror the shapes in the vertical axis and place them in the middle of the grid without overlapping them onto the original form. The mirrored shapes will be placed in the right half of the output grid whereas the original shapes remain in the same place as in the input grid.\\\\n21. The pattern transformation consists of turning the grid 90 degrees clockwise and then reflecting it in the vertical axis. This has the effect of mirroring the shapes and moving them across the grid. Any non-black cell which was in position (x, y) ends up in position (width - y -1, x), where width is the number of columns in the grid.\\\\n22. To make the output, you have to identify the squares with color on them and add a diagonal line of that color, going from the top left to the bottom right, starting from the square on row 4, column 5 and ending in row 1, column 10. The squares that were not originally color stay as they were in the input.\\\\n23. To transform the grid, a mirror image of the shapes seen in the input grid is formed on the opposite side along the y-axis. In simpler terms, the grid is reflected with respect to its vertical axis. The existing pattern in the input grid remains the same. Only if an orange color (7) or brown (9) square is present, a mirror image is formed, the rest of the grid remains black. If the pattern is on the right side of the input, its reflection will be on the left side of the output and vice versa.\\\\n24. To make the output, you have to reflect the \\\\\\'L\\\\\\' shaped figure about the diagonal running from the top-right corner to the bottom-left corner. Essentially, all non-black squares are mirrored across this main anti-diagonal. The top-right become bottom-left.\\\\n25. The transformation applied to the input grid is a horizontal mirror reflection around the central vertical axis. The colored shapes are reflected over the central axis while maintaining their initial shapes in the mirror image.\\\\n26. For the transformation, locate the colored square figure at the top left corner. Reflect its pixels horizontally centered on the entire grid to the right side. Apply the same principle to the colored square located at the bottom right but reflect it vertically centered on the top side. Replace those reflected pixels on the corresponding color. Everything else remain black.\\\\n27. In order to make the output, you observe the shape and position of the two orange squares in the input grid, then reflect it diagonally to the other half of the screen. You should keep the original shapes and just paint the reflected ones, then finally merge both the original and reflected shapes.\\\\n28. To make the output, you have to  perform a 45-degree clockwise rotation of the coloured boxes. This causes the pointing direction of the triangles to change from left to right. The triangles in the top half rotate to point right, the ones in the bottom half rotate to point left.\\\\n29. To make the output, you have to mirror the colored points of the upper-left quadrant onto the upper-right quadrant across the vertical centre line, and subsequently spin these points 90 degrees clockwise, retaining their relative positions to each other. The points of color in the lower-left quadrant remain unaltered in the transformation.\\\\n30. To make the output, you have to place the mirrored image of the pixel squared pattern on right side with same color as given at left side, the mirrored image is created by diagonally reflecting the pattern.\\\\n31. To make the output, rotate the pattern of colored cells in the top half corner in the input grid 180 degrees clockwise to the middle of the grid. Leave the bottom half of the grid as it is in the input grid.\\\\n32. To make the output, you have to reflect the non-black cells around the vertical center line of the grid. The position of the reflected cell on the other side will be directly proportional to its distance from the mid-line. This can be seen as a mirror image forming on the other side.\\\\n33. To make the output, you have to reflect the shape formed by the color blocks diagonally across the grid. Here, left bottom corner of the input grid is considered to be the origin and reflection is performed across the line y=x.\\\\n34. To make the output you will need to perform rotations. For each set of orange squares, rotate them 90 degrees in a clockwise direction around the center of the board. The squares that were on the top move to the right side, the squares that were on the right move to the bottom, the squares from the bottom move to the left and squares from the left move to the top. It\\\\\\'s like the entire arrangement of orange squares has been spun around.\\\\n35. To transform the grid, reflect the blocks of color along their quadrant\\\\\\'s diagonal. For example, a block at position (3,2) in quadrant 2 would be mirrored to position (2,3) in quadrant 2.\\\\n36. To make the output, replicate the placement of colored boxes by reflection along the center of the respective 5x5 square. This results in a symmetrical pattern in each 5x5 quadrants. The colored square remains in the same position in the 5x5 quadrant, but it appears at a reflected position along the central axis, formed by cells [1,4] and [4,1] (using 1 based index, and axis starting from top left corner of each quadrant).\\\\n37. To make the output, you have to mirror the shape from each half of the grid along a line running diagonally from the top left to bottom right of the grid.

The colors used in the output have the same shades as used in the input grid.\\\\n39. To make the output, you have to first keep upper left and lower right quadrants as they are. Then in the upper right quadrant, diagonally mirror the shapes with the main diagonal as mirror axis. The similar operation is performed for the lower left quadrant with bottom right to top left diagonal serving as the mirror axis.\\\\n40. To generate the output grid, take the shape of the color in the input and mirror it along the central vertical axis. Then, place the mirrored image on the original shape. For the colors that are on the central vertical axis, simply duplicate them on the right side of the axis.\\\\n41. To make the output, reflect the two smaller squares of color along the main diagonal. The main diagonal runs from the top left corner to the bottom right corner. The squares will still be the same shape, but their positions will be mirrored across the main diagonal.\\\\n42. To make the output, you have to take the incomplete shapes, and complete them by mirroring their existing structure diagonally. The line reflected forms a 45-degree incline (northwest to southeast). The pattern forms two right angle triangles or a square - filled and unfilled. Mirror them by forming the symmetrical reflection of the incomplete part.\\\\n43. To make the output, you have to reflect the 2x2 colored squares along the vertical central axis of the grid, while keeping the positions of the original squares intact. This creates a mirror image of the squares on the right side of the grid.\\\\n44. To make the output, you have to rotate the arrow 45 degrees clockwise. The arrow\\\\\\'s tip will point towards the right. If the cells flipped are outside of the 10x10 grid, they will move to the left side, creating a wrapping around effect.\\\\n45. To create the output grid, first, identify the \\\\\\'L\\\\\\' shape in the first half of the grid and copy it to the top right of the output grid, starting it at the top corner and reflecting it so it fits the right half\\\\\\'s upper corner. Do the same for the \\\\\\'L\\\\\\' shape in the lower half of the input grid. However, place it in the output grid\\\\\\'s lower left corner and reflect it so it fits the left half\\\\\\'s lower corner.\\\\n46. To make the output, you have to reflect the position of the orange \\\\\\'7\\\\\\' in each grid along the main diagonal. This means that the orange \\\\\\'7\\\\\\'s that are at position (i,j) in the the input grid will be at position (j,i) in the output grid. Other cells remain black.\\\\n47. The transformation involves reflecting the elements (orange or brown cells) from the top half to the bottom half, and from the left half to the right half, with the center of the grid as the point of symmetry. If a cell in the top half or left half is colored, the corresponding cell in the bottom half or right half becomes colored with the same color.\\\\n48. To make the output, you have to rotate the colored squares 90 degrees counter-clockwise while the black squares remain in their original location.\\\\n49. To make the output, the transformation process involves rotating the orange/brown shapes in the input grid by 90 degrees counterclockwise around the center of the grid. Black squares remain black.\\\\n50. To make the output, you should rotate the entire grid 90 degrees counterclockwise, but only rotate cells that are part of the colored squares. The rest of the grid remains the same as the input.\\\\n51. To create the output grid, you need to take the colored blocks and mirror them vertically to complete the square. This mirror operation doesn\\\\\\'t replace any existing blocks. So if there is a colored block already there, it remains as it is.\\\\n52. To make the output, you have to rotate the entire color shape 90 degrees clockwise about the center of the grid.\\\\n53. To make the output, you have to create a reflection of the existing V shape. The mirror line for the reflection is the central horizontal line of the grid. Make sure that if the V shape in the input grid is in the top half, the reflective V shape in the output should be in the bottom half and conversely.\\\\n54. To make the output, you have to mirror the L-shapes in the input grid along the vertical line running through the middle of the grid. This means that the pre-existing L-shapes retain their shapes and positions, but an additional, mirror-image L-shape is created on the opposite side of the grid. The rest of the grid remains black.\\\\n55. The transformation involves taking the colored zone (either orange or brown) in the grid and rotating it by 90 degrees counterclockwise, keeping the center of the grid as the pivot point. The rest of the grid remains black.\\\\n56. To make the output, reflect the non-black squares of the input grid along the main diagonal. The main diagonal starts from top left and ends at bottom right of the grid. Non-black squares that are on the main diagonal should remain at the same position.\\\\n57. The transformation involves reflecting the diamond shape along the central vertical axis of the grid. Thus, the colored blocks on the left side of the central axis will be mirrored on the right side. The position on the right side is determined by the relative distance of the colored block from the central axis. Every other detail in the image stays the same.\\\\n58. To make the output, you have to maintain the same arrangement and swap the colored positions with an imaginary central vertical axis. In other words, you reflect the colored blocks over the vertical axis at the middle of the grid.\\\\n59. To make the output, you mirror the upright \\\\\\'7\\\\\\' shape diagonally to the right side of the grid (like reflecting in a mirror sitting diagonally from the upper left to the lower right corner). The mirrorline cuts the grid into two equal triangular parts. Do the same transformation with the upside down \\\\\\'7\\\\\\' if any. The mirrored \\\\\\'7\\\\\\' is inverted along the horizontal central axis. All other squares remain black.\\\\n60. To make the output, you have to reflect the diagonal lines around the center point of the grid. Essentially, the lines will curve in towards the center.\\\\n61. To make the output, you have to reflect each of the colored figures along the horizontal axis (the middle row of the grid). The location of the original figures does not change.\\\\n62. The transformation is a rotation of the L-shaped object. In the case of the top left corner L-shape, It rotates by 90 degrees anti-clockwise around the center of the grid (5,5). However, in the case of bottom left corner L-shape, it rotates by 90 degrees clockwise around the center of the grid (5,5). All other cell colors remain the same.\\\\n63. The transformation process involves the following steps: 1. Identify the group of oranges/browns from the top or bottom half of the grid. 2. Mirror this group diagonally from top-left to bottom-right. 3. Replace any black cell that intersects with the mirrored group with the corresponding color from the group. Leave the rest as black. Please note that any color in the input can be mirrored in this way, not just orange or brown.\\\\n64.

To make the output, you have to turn all the border cells of the grid into teal, while all the rest remain black.\\\\n37. To make the output, fill the cells at the border of the grid with teal and leave the cells inside the border black.\\\\n38. The transformation involves turning the outer perimeter of the grid teal, while the inner part of the grid remains black. So, change all the edge cells of the grid to teal, meaning the color associated with the number 8.\\\\n39. To make the output, make a \"border\" of teal squares which go around the edge of the grid. The rest of the squares inside the border should remain black.\\\\n40. To make the output, you have to create a border of teal squares around the grid, regardless of its original size, leaving the center squares as black.\\\\n41. To make the output, you have to make a border of teal cells around the grid, the rest of the cells in the grid should be left black.\\\\n42. To make the output grid, you have to create a teal colored frame shape around the grid leaving the centre as black.\\\\n43. To create the output grid, replace the perimeter cells (the cells in the first and last row as well as the first and last column) of the input grid with teal (number 8), and leave the rest of the cells black.\\\\n44. To make the output, you have to color all the boundary elements of the grid with teal. Leave the interior elements as black. It is like creating a border around the grid with teal color.\\\\n45. To make the output, you have to change the outer border of the grid to teal while leaving the inner grid black.\\\\n46. To make the output, you have to turn the border cells in the input grid into teal cells in the output grid. Leave the inner cells black.\\\\n47. To make the output, you have to create a teal border around the grid, leaving the center of the grid as black. This is essentially creating a hollow square of teal border. If the grid size is bigger, then it is necessary to leave more cells in the center black, so that the thickness of the teal border does not change.\\\\n48. To make the output, you have to occupy all the outermost cells with the color teal (represented by 8) leaving the inner cells black (represented by 0) i.e. turn the edge of the grid into teal, leaving the rest of the grid black.\\\\n49. To make the output, you have to fill the border of the grid with teal cells, and the interior of the grid with black cells.\\\\n50. To make the output, draw teal color around the border of the grid and keep the center cells black.\\\\n51. To make the output, you have to fill the outermost layer of the square with teal color (which is represented by the number 8). The interior of the square should remain black.\\\\n52. To make the output grid, you have to fill the border of the grid with teal and keep the inside boxes black. This creates something like a picture frame.\\\\n53. To create the output, replace all the cells on the boundary of the grid with teal, whereas the rest of the cells in the middle remain black.\\\\n54. To make the output, you have to add a teal border to the black grid remaining the inside of the grid black.\\\\n55. To create the output, replace all the cells on the outer boundary of the grid with teal colour, while the rest of the cells remain black. This forms a teal-colored border around the black grid.\\\\n56. The transformation for the output would be to convert the boundary cells or perimeter of the grid to teal (8) while leaving all other cells as black.\\\\n57. To make the output, you have to transform the outermost cells to teal (8) and keep the inner cells black (0), essentially drawing a square frame of teal around the grid.\\\\n58. To make the output, you have to draw a teal border around the entire black grid leaving the center and all other squares black.\\\\n59. To make the output, you have to turn the edge cells into teal cells and keep the inner cells black. Basically, you are creating a frame or a border around the black cells with teal cells.\\\\n60. To make the output, transform the grid by filling all the border cells with the color teal (denoted by the number 8). The rest of the cells remain black (denoted by the number 0) forming a defined border.\\\\n61. To make the output, you have to draw a border of teal cells around the grid - this should be one cell thick and should be on the outer edge of the grid. The rest of the cells remain black.\\\\n62. To make the output, you have to replace the border of the grid with color teal (number 8), leaving the interior cells black (number 0).\\\\n63. To make the output, convert every edge cell of the grid to teal colored while keeping the inner cells as black. In other words, you draw a teal border around the grid while the center remains black.\\\\n64. To make the output, you have to paint the boundary or border cells of the grid teal (8). The cells inside the border remain black (0). This forms a teal frame around a black inner square.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "All the rules provided can be categorized into one category as they all describe the same process of creating a teal border around a black grid.

To make the output, you have to find the color of the squares in the input grid that is formed with four cells joined together and filled with the color. Use this color to fill the cells of the same position in the 2x2 output grid. As for the cells formed from lines in the input grid, fill their respective positions in the 2x2 output grid with 0 representing black color. It can be seen as the pattern is a kind of compression, with the top left and bottom left areas being compressed into 2x2 areas in the output.\\\\n2. The output grid can be made by selecting the second row of the top shape and the second-to-last row of the bottom shape of the input grid. If there is no such row, fill the entire row with black.\\\\n3. To make the output, look at the color and shape of the object on the right side of the input grid. The color of the output grid is the color of this object. Then, observe the shape of the object on the left side of the input grid. The shape of the output grid matches this shape.\\\\n4. The transformation involves shrinking the shapes on the input grid. Each 2x2 \"square\" in the input grid becomes a single cell in the output grid, with the color being preserved in the transformation. The black lines disappeared in the output grid, therefore, consider the first color that appears in the square, going from left to right, top to bottom.\\\\n5. To make the output, you have to take the second row of the top pattern and first two and the last row of the second pattern. Merge it into a 2x4 grid where the first 2 columns are the second row of the top pattern and the last 2 columns are the first and the last row of the bottom pattern. Replace the black cells with numbers from the bottom pattern within the output grid. Leave the remaining part of the grid black.\\\\n6. To make the output, you have to transform the colored shapes of the input mapped into a smaller space, maintaining their shape and relative positioning. The output displays only those shapes, ignoring the large empty spaces, effectively clipping out each colored pattern and aligning them close together. Each color from the input (excluding black) remains consistent in the output.\\\\n7. To generate the output grid, you have to look at the patterns in the top and bottom sections of the input grid. The output grid is a replication of the top-most pattern (the row under the most top black cell) of the bottom section and the bottom-most pattern (the row above the most bottom black cell) of the top section. The cells with the specific color pattern in the top section should be placed at the bottom of the output grid. Similarly, the cells from bottom section should be placed at the top of the output grid. All the cells are slid to the left to create the output grid, eliminating any extra black space on the left side of them. This could be seen as pushing the shapes to the left boundary.\\\\n8. The transformation can be described as the lower half of the first colored pattern (the one at the top) combined with the top half of the second colored pattern (the one at the bottom), where the two halves are joined along the middle line of black cells.  For example, in Case 0, the last two rows of the red pattern at the top and the first two rows of the teal pattern at the bottom have been combined. The same principle applies to other cases.\\\\n9. To make the output, you have to add the shapes from top to bottom. Pick the second color that appeared on the grid from top to bottom. For those cells of the input grid that match the chosen color, transform the grid to match their shape and relative position, while keeping the color of the cells in the output grid as they are in the input grid. Generate a new grid that is the minimal size to accommodate the transformed cells.\\\\n10. To create the output grid, superimpose the first colored shape onto the second colored shape. If a position in the first colored shape overlaps with a position in the second shape, the overlapping square should receive the color from the first shape. If a position in the first shape does not overlap with a position in the second shape, the square should be black.\\\\n11. To make the output, you have to take the three colored sections in the input grid, and overlay them on top of each other by placing the bottom one at the base, the middle one in the middle and the top one at the top. When you do this, if two shapes overlap then the space becomes black, and if there is only one color in a given space then that is the color of the output.\\\\n12. The grid becomes the middle figure, but instead of the second color used within the input grid, the color from the uppermost figure is used in the output, while the placement of the color remains the same.\\\\n13. To make the output, a section of the colored shape in the upper left quadrant of the input grid should be copied and pasted at the top section of the output grid, towards the right. Similarly, a section of the colored shape in the lower right quadrant of the input grid should be copied and pasted to the bottom section of the output grid, towards the left.\\\\n14. To make the output, in the first 2x2 square of input, count how many times the non-black colors appear. The colors are red, blue, green, yellow, grey, fuschia, orange, teal, brown. The counting is done for each half separately. The non-black color in top half is mapped to the top-left and top-right squares of output. The non-black color in bottom half is mapped to the bottom-left and bottom-right squares of output. If a non-black color does not appear, the square remains black.\\\\n15. To make the output, we take the topmost number \\\\\\'2\\\\\\' from each colored shape (in the top and bottom region of the input grid) and form the top row of the output grid with them. Similarly, we take the bottommost number \\\\\\'2\\\\\\' from each colored shape and form the bottom row of the output grid with them. If we encounter a 0 (black cell) as we encounter it in our input, we put that in the output at the corresponding place. This transformation is best described as vertically squeezing the colored shapes into the output grid.\\\\n16. The input grid is transformed into the output by taking the shape from the top right quadrant of the input grid and transforming it to fit the smaller size of the output grid. The color of the shape in the input grid is not changed in the output grid.\\\\n17. To make the output, you have to focus on the shape formed by the color on the top right and the bottom left. Copy them and abstract them into a 2x4 grid on the output, such that the top-half shape retains its color and the bottom-half shape is set to black (represented by zero). If the shape portion falls into half of the grid, the other half of the output cells in that row are set to black.\\\\n18. To make the output, you have to imagine that the lowermost left and right points of the upper formation form the limit for a rectangle. Next, overlay this rectangle onto the lower formation. The cells that coincide are the output.\\\\n19. To make the output, you identify the largest properly defined shape based on the number of colored cells, excluding black. The color of this shape fills up the output 2x2 square. In the case of more than one shape having the largest area, take the one closer to the bottom right.   A properly defined shape for this transformation means that all of its colored cells are connected either horizontally or vertically, and it can be contained within a rectangular area of the grid separated from other objects by black cells.\\\\n20. Merge the L shape patterns found on the top half and the bottom half of the input grid. The top-left corner of each output L-shape contains the same colored cell as the top half of the input grid. The bottom-right corner contains the same colored cell as the bottom half of the input. Rest cells are filled with the color found at the corners. If no color is found at the corner then fill those cells with black.\\\\n21. To produce the output grid, extract and replicate the middle part of each shape in the input grid. The top half shapes on the input grid will make the top row of the output grid. The bottom half shape will make the bottom row of the grid.\\\\n22. To make the output, you have to take the areas where the two L shapes overlap. Any area where one L shape is present but not the other should be colored black. Thus, the output should be the overlapping area of the two shapes, maintaining the color from the input grid.\\\\n23. To make the output, you have to ignore all zeros and replicate only the colored shape next to the right edge of the grid, but in the output grid, rotate the shape 90 degrees counter-clockwise also discard all zeros in the shape. The first row of the output consists of the top row of the chosen shape transformed, and the second row of the output consists of the second row after rotation.\\\\n24. To make the output, you have to focus on the small object in the center of the input grid and copy it over to the output grid without its surrounding black background.\\\\n25. To transform the grid visualize a case where you are focusing only on the top half of the input. Here, the rightmost shape is to be copied and resized to fit the 2x4 grid requirement of the output. The original shape becomes the right half of the output while maintaining its orientation. Black squares in the shape should also be preserved.\\\\n26. The transformation pattern is based on comparing each quadrant\\\\\\'s colored cells. For each quadrant, you can generate corresponding output squares as follows: If there is larger number of colored cells in top-right quadrant compared to the top-left quadrant, output the color from the top-right quadrant to the top left cell in the output grid. Repeat this comparison and method for the rest of the cells in the output grid. (Bottom-right to bottom-left, top-left to top-right, and bottom-left to bottom-right)\\\\n27. To obtain the output from the input, the transformation involves finding the colored shapes that form a complete square when considered as a whole. The two tetrominoes and the single square cell should be combined into this square shape. Then, the square is reduced in size: every 2x2 square inside the located square in the input becomes a single cell in the output, retaining the color of the upper-left cell in the original 2x2 square. The transformation follows a kind of \\\\\\'compression\\\\\\' rule or \\\\\\'downscaling\\\\\\' rule to compress the larger square into a smaller square.\\\\n28. To make the output, you have to shrink each distinct shape in the input by removing the black cells outside and in-between the shapes. Output grid consists of two shrinked shapes where each shrinked shape occupies a separate row in the output. The order of the shapes from top to bottom will match the same ranking order in the input.\\\\n29. To make the output, focus only on the portion of the upper color object that is symmetrical in the vertical axis (mirrored on left and right side). Remove the rest of the grid by shrinking it down. The lower color object does not affect the pattern at all and may be ignored.\\\\n30. To create the output grid, consider the quadrants that contain the \"7\" shape in the input grid. In these quadrants, the \"7\" shape is made of colored cells arranged in two rows and two columns. The colors of the cells making up the \"7\" shape form the output grid, with the 2x2 part of the \"7\" shape forming the first two columns of the output grid and the 2x2 part of the \"7\" without the cells in the first row forming the last two columns. Replace the black cells (color 0) with the color of the cells that were omitted from the \"7\" shape. The first two rows in the output correspond to the upper and lower quadrants containing the \"7\" shape, respectively.\\\\n31. To make the output, you have to look at the two colored figures in the upper and lower parts of the grid respectively (separated by an empty middle area). Ignore the far right colored structure if present - it plays no role in the transformation. The transformation forms a grid with the color corresponding to the leftmost box of each figure. If this area is black, take color from the second leftmost box. The arrangement in the grid reflects the structure of input - the upper structure in the input grid forms the upper row in the output and the lower structure in the input forms the lower row in the output.\\\\n32. The output is created by scaling down the input and depending on the shapes. If in the input the blue shape is directly on top of the red shape, then in the output, the red shape is kept, else, the blue shape is kept.\\\\n33. To make the output, you examine the input grid and locate the 3x3 square with a colored border. Remove the border from this square, and keep the middle part that is left. That is your output.\\\\n34. To make the output, you have to remove all cells of the input grid except the colored shape at the center. The size of the output grid matches the size of the colored shape in the center of the input grid.\\\\n35. To make the output, you take the smallest shape from the input and place it in the output grid. If the smallest shape appeared multiple times in the input, all of those instances should be in the output as well. The shape should be on the same level as it was in the input but the order of the shapes should be reversed horizontally.\\\\n36. To make the output, you will remove the upper and lower edges of the input grid until the first colored cells. After that, take the 2x4 center of the remaining grid, being mindful to keep symmetric the remaining cells in the hollow space in the middle. This center will become the output grid.\\\\n37. For the transformation, take the fourth row from the colored shape in the top half and the third row from the colored shape in the bottom half of the input grid. Place these rows as the first and second row of the output grid respectively. Remove any black cells on the sides of these rows to get a 2x4 output.\\\\n38. To make the output, you have to take the number in the top half of the input grid then take the bottom number of that number as the first row. Then, take the number in the bottom half of the input grid as the second row. Put each number on a 2x2 grid. Then, take the first number on the right side of the top half of the input grid and merge with the second number on the left side of the bottom half of the input grid and place it on a 2x2 grid on the right. The output should be a 2x4 grid.\\\\n39. To make the output, you have to take the bottom half of each distinct colored shape in the input grid and place them side by side in the output grid. Taking the colored shape in the upper left quadrant as the left part of the output, and the upper right quadrant as the right part of the output.\\\\n40. To transform the input into the output grid, look at the colored squares that aren\\\\\\'t black in the top half and bottom half of the grid. Select the square that is completely surrounded by black on the outside. Then, create a new grid that consists of these full squares only. The top half filled squares from the input become the top row in the output. Do the same for the bottom half. Remove any rows or columns that consist only of black.\\\\n41. To make the output, you have to find the figure from the input that appears both at the top and bottom, regardless of its shape. Then, you need to replicate the figure in mirror image on the output. The mirror image of the figure should be positioned starting from the top of the output grid and flipped horizontally.\\\\n42. The transformation involves shrinking the non-black squares from the input grid. The two squares in the top row with different colored pixels are merged into a 1x2 square with the same colored pixels in the top row of the output. The two squares in the bottom row with different colored pixels are merged into a 1x2 square with the same colored pixels in the bottom row of the output.\\\\n43. To make the output, you should remove the right-side shape\\\\\\'s quadrant, and only capture the initial 2x2 grid from the left-side shape. No rotation or reflection is required.\\\\n44. To derive the output from the input, you need to look for the two designed shapes in the input. Then you need to shrink each of these designed shapes down to a 2x2 size by converting every 2x2 block of the same color in the shape into a single cell of that color in the output. Here, black cells in the shape can be treated as if they were colored. Arrange the two 2x2 shapes in the output where the first shape takes the upper 2 rows in the output and the second shape takes the bottom 2 rows.\\\\n45. To create the output, you need to first ignore the original black cells on the grid. Then, look for the colored shapes on the input grid. Take only the internal color cells of the shape that has an \\\\\\'L\\\\\\' shape. The \\\\\\'L\\\\\\' is constructed by the longest continuous series of colored cells in one column intersecting with the longest continuous series of colored cells in one row. The output grid is the \\\\\\'L\\\\\\' shape where the cells have been replaced with the color of the shape. The arrangement of colored cells in the output corresponds to the arrangement in the input (maintaining right or left-handedness of the \\\\\\'L\\\\\\').\\\\n46. To make the output, you have to rotate the top colored shape 90 degrees to the right and scale down the size by a factor of 2. This shape becomes the top part of the output. For the bottom part of the output, rotate the bottom colored shape 90 degrees to the right and scale down the size by a factor of 2. Ignore all black cells when performing these transformations.\\\\n47. To transform the input grid to the output, take the matching shaped block from the lower part of the input grid. Output grid consists of the smallest rectangular unit covering all instances of the color that matches in the same pattern from the upper part of the input grid.\\\\n48. To make the output, you need to reproduce the smallest object\\\\\\'s highest row and lowest row. If both objects are the same size, select the top one\\\\\\'s highest and lowest row. All the black cells in the rows should be included.\\\\n49. To make the output, you have to extract the 2x4 regions from the middle of the upper and lower colored sections in the input. You begin extraction from the second cell of each colored region from the left side. Each extraction step should contain a column of 2 cells. Repeat this until you have 4 columns. The extraction sequence for the second case would be (from left to right): the third column of the blue region, the fourth column of the blue region, the third column of the red region, and the fourth column of the red region.\\\\n50. To convert the input into the output, find the last two lines in each colored shape (not counting black) and reflect them into a 2x4 grid. The reflection should start from the last row that contains color to the upper direction. Note that in this context, \"last\" refers to the furthest along in the direction of color progression across the grid.\\\\n51. To make the output, identify the shape in the upper part of the input grid, and shrink it down to a 2x2 positive square outline and replicate it in the output.\\\\n52. To make the output, you have to find the two coloured shapes in the input grid. The first shape on the top will go on the first row of the output grid and the second shape on the bottom will go on the second row of the output grid. Each coloured cell in the input that aligns horizontally with a cell in the output will color that cell in the output grid. The rest of the cells remain as black.\\\\n53. To make the output, you need to coalesce the two colored pieces in the input grid into one by removing the separating black rows and black columns. The output grid then takes shape from the adjacent cells of the maximum dimensions from both pieces.\\\\n54. To make the output, you have to identify the figure found in the lower third of the input grid and rotate it 180 degrees. The dimensions of the shape remain consistent in the transformation; only the orientation changes. Black boxes are rotated along with the colored figure.\\\\n55. To make the output, you have to take the color of the bottom square from the input grid (ignoring black) and create a smaller version of the top square in the input grid with this same color in the output. The remaining cells should be set to 0 (black).\\\\n56. To make the output, you have to focus on the colored figures. The top half of the input grid contains the first colored figure while the bottom half contains the second colored figure. Convert the first shape into a 2x2 grid, where the color of a cell in the output is determined by the majority color of the corresponding quarter of the shape. Then, do the same for the second shape, placing it to the right of the first one in the output. If a quarter of the colored figure is majorly black or empty, the corresponding cell in the output should be black or empty.\\\\n57. To transform each input into the output, ignore everything that isn\\\\\\'t making part of the quadrilateral. Then remove the black cells surrounding the color and create a new 2x4 grid only with the remaining colored cells regardless of their original color, maintaining their orientation.\\\\n58. To make the output, you have to find the smallest square of colored cells that contain at least one cell from each colored formation from the input. Rotate it 90 degrees clockwise. The remaining cells should be filled in with black cells.\\\\n59. To make the output, you have to select a 2x4 section from the top colored shape and bottom colored shape, in the shape respective to the original position of the top shape in input grid. If the top shape in the input is towards the right, select the 2x4 section from the right side of the bottom shape and vice versa. Repeat this pattern for the top shape. If there is no such matching section in the bottom shape, it should be filled with black boxes in the output grid.\\\\n60. To make the output, you have to take the 2x4 slice of the grid which is located at the middle of the shape on the upper-right quadrant of the input grid, effectively cropping out any other parts of the input.\\\\n61. To make the output, take the colored shape from the top left corner of the input and put this in the top right corner of the output, then take the colored shape from the bottom right corner of the input and put this in the bottom left corner of the output. The other squares in the output are black. The shapes keep their original orientation.\\\\n62. Extract the largest 2x4 shape from each of the top and bottom half that contains no black cells. If the bottom half does not contain a 2x4 shape without black cells, than construct the shape from an equivalent area in the original colored shape. Lastly, if the color of the smaller shape in the top half is also present in the bottom half, then replace this color with the larger shape color. Concatenate the two 2x4 shapes from bottom to top to get the output.\\\\n63. To make the output, you need to identify the second figure\\\\\\'s shape in the bottom part of the input and scale it down by merging each 2x2 square into one square of the same color. The result is manifested in the output grid.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "After analyzing the rules, they can be categorized into eight distinct categories based on their similarities:\n\n1.

For each category, synthesize the rules into a single, specific rule that combines the ideas of all rules in that category, while clearly differentiating it from the other categories.\\\\nThe new rule should be as specific as possible, following the format of the given rules.\\\\nThe new rule should be applicable without any information from the original rules - i.e. it should be standalone.\\\\n\\\\nRules:\\\\n1. To make the output, you need to replace each 0 in the input grid with the number that precedes it in the same row.\\\\n2. The transformation process is a simple removal of the black cells. In other words, replace all black spaces (0 numbered cells) with the colored cells to their right. This will push all black spaces to the right border of the region they belong to. The black cells will only shift horizontally but not vertically during the transformation. Each individual color pattern retains their grouping in the output as well.\\\\n3. To make the output, you have to cover the blank (black) cells with the color of the cell on its diagonal left, i.e., the color of the cell at row-1, col-1 position from it. If there is no cell on the diagonal left of the blank cell, keep it blank as is.\\\\n4. To transform the input grid into the output grid, every black cell (0) and teal cell (8), on the diagonal or within a square area of one cell mid-way between the main diagonal and the grid edge, keeps its color. In any other area, if an i-colored cell is not surrounded by cells in color (i-1) above it and to its left, and cells in color (i+1) below it and to its right, color the cell in color (i+1). Black cells outside these areas should be recolored into color 1 (blue) and teal cells outside these areas should remain unchanged. Perform similar transformations for i-colored cell, for i in 1 to 7.\\\\n5. To make the output, the transformation involves removing the diagonal line of zeros found in the input grid. The zeros are replaced with the next appropriate number in the existing pattern sequence.\\\\n6. The transformation should be done by removing those empty spaces (\\\\\\'0\\\\\\') and shifting the numbers below it up. In other words, this operation is very similar to a \"gravity pull\", where the empty spaces move upwards and numbers move downwards until they encounter another number.\\\\n7. To make the output pattern, you have to take out all the black cells and fill that space with the color to the right of the black cell.\\\\n8. The transformation involves replacing any instances of black squares that are surrounded on all four sides by the same number with that number. This means that isolated black squares or black squares at the edge of the gradient are left as they are.\\\\n9. To get the output, you replace any black cells (0\\\\\\'s) in the input grid with the most common color in its row. Therefore, the transformation rule is to fill all black segments in each line with the color which appears most frequently in the same line.\\\\n10. The transformation of the grid involves copying all the cells from the input to the output, while keeping a copy of black cells (represented by the digit 0) only when it is surrounded by colored cells (any digit from 1 to 8) from above and below. For all cells that do not adhere to this condition, they are filled with colored cells from its top. Therefore, if there\\\\\\'s a black cell only surrounded from below by a colored cell, it will assume the color of the cell above it. If the black cell is located at the top row, it will copy the color of the cell below it.\\\\n11. To make the output, replace all black squares with the color of square that should have been in its place according to the color pattern in the rest of the row.\\\\n12. To transform the input grid to the output grid, replace all occurrences of the color black (represented by the number 0) with the color that surrounds it the most on its left, right, top, and bottom neighbors. The diagonal neighbors are ignored. In case of a tie between two or more colors, prefer the color with the highest numeric value. All other colored cells remain unchanged.\\\\n13. To make the output, you have to erase all the 0\\\\\\'s from the input grid. Instead of a 0, put the number that completes the spiral formation sequence at its position.\\\\n14. To transform the input into the output, replace all 0\\\\\\'s in the grid that are immediately surrounded by the same color on all sides (diagonals are not considered). The replaced 0\\\\\\'s becomes the color that surrounded it.\\\\n15. To make the output, you have to remove the black cells denoted by zero in the input grid. Specifically, if there are three consecutive zeros in the rows, and those zeros are surrounded by the same number, replace the zeros with that number. The three zeros surrounded by different numbers remain as zeros. This transformation essentially fills in concentrations of black (zero) cells, when they appear in line of three and are surrounded by all the same number cells.\\\\n16. The transformation pattern here is a simple clean up operation. To transform the input grid to the output grid, you simply replace any zeros found in the middle of a line with the repeated number in that line. For instance, [5, 4, 4, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7] would become [5, 4, 4, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7].\\\\n17. To get the output grid from the input grid, replace the white squares based on the color of the square to their upper right. If there is no square to the upper right, the color is kept the same.\\\\n18. To make the output, you have to replace the block of black cells with cells of color adjacent to it in direct horizontal and vertical direction. If black cells are surrounded by multiple colors, then take the color of the cells that were traversed first while scanning from top to bottom  and left to right.\\\\n19. To make the output, you have to replace all the black cells (0) with the number that is above them. If the black cell is on the top row, replace it with the number below it.\\\\n20. To make the output, you need to replace the \\\\\\'black\\\\\\' cells with cells of a different color following a specific pattern. Follow the diagonal line of the \\\\\\'black\\\\\\' cells, when you encounter a \\\\\\'black\\\\\\' cell, change it to the color that is currently seen most frequently in the same row to the left of the \\\\\\'black\\\\\\' cell (not including the \\\\\\'black\\\\\\' cell itself). However, if the most frequent color is the same as the current cell colour, then choose the second most frequent color. If neighbors have equal and maximum occurrences, choose the color with the smaller value. Continue this until you have replaced all the \\\\\\'black\\\\\\' cells. In the end, there should be no \\\\\\'black\\\\\\' cells left in the grid.\\\\n21. To make the output grid, you have to remove the nestled patterns and fill these areas with the same signal that encloses them. In other words, replace the 0s with the enclosing number pattern. This process creates a more homogenous pattern from rows 3 to 10.\\\\n22. To transform the input into the output, remove the arrays of black cells running from the central square to the top left and bottom right corners at 45 degree angles, letting the underlying diagonal stripes of color show through. For the central square of black cells, change it to match the color of the diagonal stripe of color that it overlays. This color can be found in the position directly to the left of the central black square, or in the position directly above it.\\\\n23. To make the output, you have to replace the digit 0 in the input with the number that is in the mirror position reflected along the diagonal from the upper left to the lower right corner, the main diagonal.\\\\n24. A transformation from input to output involves turning all zeroes in the grid into the number/color that is located directly left to each zero.\\\\n25. Looking at various cases, we can conclude that all black cells are replaced with the cell above it in the input grid to generate the output grid. If the black cell is the topmost cell in that column, the cell from the row immediately below it is used.\\\\n26. To make the output, you have to replace the black cells with the symbol that is above, below, or to the sides of the black cell, but priority is given to the symbols associated with the numbers 4 and 5. If the black cell is surrounded by different symbols, replace the black cell by the repeating pattern of 4 and 5 alternating from the left to the right (4,5,4,5...).\\\\n27. To make the output, you have to remove the black squares in the input and replace them with the color that would have been there if the rainbow pattern was uninterrupted. Every Central black square is replaced by the color associated with the row it is located within the rainbow color order. Besides this, the grid remains the same.\\\\n28. To make the output, you have to replace all the black shades with the color that appears the most frequently in the 3x3 region surrounding it. In case of a tie, use the smallest number (or the lightest shade). If there are not any colors around the black shade then it should remain black.\\\\n29. The transformation involves replacing the black cells with the color of the cell located diagonally to its top-left, unless the black cell is part of a cluster of black cells arranged in a straight line. In that case, the color of the cell to the immediate left of the cluster is adopted. The rotated cells retain their original color.\\\\n30. To obtain the output from the input, all numbers (denoting colors) that are \"inside\" (bounded above and below or to the left and right) by the same number are \"protected\" and remain the same, while the unprotected cells (cell value 0) that are surrounded by a particular color change to match that color. In other words, any 0 cell which is surrounded by any number on its immediate left, right, up, or down, should change to that number.\\\\n31. To make the output, the transformation calculates a kind of spectrum normalization. The scattered black squares from the input are removed, and the colors are adjusted to maintain the progressive diagonal pattern. Except for the black squares turning into the color according to their position in the spectrum, any other square retains its original color.\\\\n32. To make the output, you have to fill in the black areas in the input grid with the color of the last stripe they interrupted. For instance, if a black shape is between blue (1) and red (2), it should be filled with blue (1). If a black shape is surrounded by a single color on either side, it should take that color.\\\\n33. To make the output, you have to replace all diagonal and vertical blocks filled with zeros to the color that is found directly on their right.   In brief, fill in the previously zero-filled spaces of the grid by copying the color of the corresponding cells to their direct right i.e. column-wise fill the cells. Keep all the other cells the same.\\\\n34. To get from the input to the output, you should look at the grid as four separate quadrants divided by the central blue area and remove all black blocks. The patterned areas are left intact.\\\\n35. To make the output, you have to replace the gray squares with the number to the left of them in the grid. If there is no number to the left as it is the first column, take the value from the square to the right instead.\\\\n36. Convert each element that was a black square back to the color it was previously. Each black square corresponds to a repetition of a sequence that starts with the same color as the black square and then repeats in descending order. That is, transform all the 0s into its corresponding previous cell color in the row.\\\\n37. The output grid can be formulated by copying the input grid and replacing each number 0 with the number repeating above it in the same column. This fills the gaps in the repeated pattern and restores the disrupted segments.\\\\n38. The transformation pattern replaces all 0\\\\\\'s that are adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to exactly two different non-zero numbers, with the lower of these two numbers. If a 0 cell is adjacent to more than two different non-zero numbers, it remains unchanged. The rest of the cells retain their values from the input grid.\\\\n39. To make the output, you have to replace black number 0 by the number on its left, if the black number 0 is on the very left border, replace it by the number right next to it.\\\\n40. To make the output, you have to change each 0 to the value of the cell to its left in the 2D grid. If there is no value to the left (in other words if the \"0\" is at the start of a row), you should change the \"0\" into the value of the cell above it.\\\\n41. To make the output, you have to replace the 0s (blacks) from the hourglass shape in the input grid with the corresponding color that spirals towards the center during the same row. The remaining pattern outside the hourglass doesn\\\\\\'t change.\\\\n42. To make the output, you have to replace each 0 in the input grid with the number that is found in the cell immediately above it and to the left. If the cell above and to the left is also a 0, keep the cell as 0. If it\\\\\\'s on the edge of the grid (meaning there isn\\\\\\'t a cell above or to the left) also keep the cell as a 0. All other numbers stay the same.\\\\n43. To make the output, you have to remove all the black cells in the input. If a cell is black, replace it with the color that is most common in the surrounding cells of the same row. This results in the output maintaining the original color gradient but without any black cells.\\\\n44. Each row of the input grid is transformed as follows: If a cell is black and the cell to its right is not black, replace it with the color of the cell that is two positions to its left. If there is no cell two positions to its left, then leave it black. If the cell to its right is black replace it with black. For all other cells, leave them as they are.\\\\n45. To transform the input into the output, black squares are replaced with the color of the square directly above them if it exists, otherwise, it remains black.\\\\n46. To make the output, you have to replace all the black cells that cut across the pyramids with the color of the top color of the respective pyramid.\\\\n47. To make the output, you have to remove all the black cells and replace them with the number to the left of them. If there is no number to the left, use the number on the right. Essentially, remove all instances of black cells.\\\\n48. To make the output, you have to replace all zeros (black squares) with the color of the square immediately to the left of the black square. If the black square is on the first column, replace it with the color of the square immediately on its right.\\\\n49. To make the output, replace every black color with the color of the number in the upper-left corner of that layer. For example, if a black square is positioned in a layer of 6 cipher color (corresponds to fuschia), the black square will be replaced with 6. Keep all the other numbers unaffected. The pattern should be applied starting from the outer layers and move towards the center.\\\\n50. To make the output, you have to remove the square of zeros from the base of both triangles by filling them with the same number pattern found in each triangle. There is no transformation involved in the regions that do not contain zeros.\\\\n51. To make the output, you have to remove the empty black cells in the input grid that are surrounded by colored cells. All textured or colored cells should maintain their color and position as in the input grid.\\\\n52. To make the output, you have to replace all 0\\\\\\'s with the number that is seen spatially clockwise relative to the spiral pattern. Every time there is an encircling round, the number increases by one (wrapping around after 6 to 1 again).\\\\n53. To make the output, you have to replace area of grid filled with the number \"0\" with both preceding number and succeeding number from the list, likewise, replace all \"0\"with each preceding number on the left side of the diagonal and succeeding number on the right side of the diagonal, keeping the rest of the numbers intact. In case no preceding number is found (when the row starts with \"0\"), replace with succeeding number and vice versa.\\\\n54. To make the output, you have to replace every \\\\\\'0\\\\\\' in the grid with the number that was on that same row 2 cells to its right in the input grid.\\\\n55. The transformation from the input to the output is to replace all the black color cells with the color cell that is on their left. If the black cell is at the beginning of the row, replace it with the color cell which is on its right.  Exception where this rule does not apply is when all cells to the left and right are also black. In this situation, leave the black cell as it is.\\\\n56. To make the output, you have to replace the black cells with the color that is most common in the same column excluding black cells. In simple terms, black cells in each column is replaced with the dominant color in that column.\\\\n57. To make the output, replace each black cell that isn\\\\\\'t on the solid line with the color of the line that is horizontally at the same level. The solid line of black cells should remain unchanged.\\\\n58. To make the output, you have to replace the each black spot with the corresponding color that is one step left to it in the same row. If there is not such a color, leave the black spot as it is.\\\\n59. To make the output, you have to replace all the 0\\\\\\'s in the input grid, with the last color before the sequence of 0\\\\\\'s in their respective lines. Number 4 replaces the zeros in rows where 4 appears before the zeros, and number 5 replaces the zeros where 5 appears before the zeros. All the other elements of the input grid remain the same in the output grid.\\\\n60. To make the output, for all cells in the input grid that are not black (0), the new value is the old value. You just need to replace the black cells with the value of the cell at the last colored position in the same row. In other words, copy the color from the leftmost cells and assign to all the black cells in that row.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "Category 1: Rules that involve replacing black cells with the color of a cell in a specific direction or position.\n1.

For each category, synthesize the rules into a single, specific rule that combines the ideas of all rules in that category, while clearly differentiating it from the other categories.\\\\nThe new rule should be as specific as possible, following the format of the given rules.\\\\nThe new rule should be applicable without any information from the original rules - i.e. it should be standalone.\\\\n\\\\nRules:\\\\n1. To form the output grid, first identify the number of blue cells which are horizontally or vertically adjacent to at least one other blue cell in the input grid. Then, in the output grid, change the same number of leftmost cells in the top row to red cells. After that, for each remaining blue cell which is not in the same row or column as any of the first group of blue cells, change the corresponding cell in the output grid to a red cell. If a cell in the input grid is black or does not meet the above conditions, then the corresponding cell in the output grid should remain black.\\\\n2. To make the output, you have to analyze the placement of blue cells. For every blue cell, color the corresponding cell in the top row red regardless of its column. If there is a blue cell in the middle row, color the cell in the middle of the output grid red. Transform the rest of the grid cells to black.\\\\n3. To make the output, you have to replace all blue cells (with value 1) in the first row of the output grid with red (with value 2), if there is at least one blue cell in the corresponding column of the input grid. Perform the same operation for the second row of the output grid using the corresponding column. The third row of the output grid is always left black (with value 0).\\\\n4. To make the output, you have to convert the blue mark to a red one if it has a blue mark in the same row or column. The rest will be left black.\\\\n5. The blue squares in the input grid form a certain shape. In the output Grid, that same shape is outputted in red at the top left part of the grid. If similar shapes appearing in bottom right part of the input, it outputs the same shape in red in the middle column of the grid.\\\\n6. The pattern seems to involve transforming the grid by color presence. If a blue color (1) appears anywhere in a row in the input grid, change the corresponding cell in the same row in the output grid to red (2). A row is identified from top to bottom, similar to the input format. Please note that the blue cell in the output grid needs to be in the same row, but not necessarily the same column where the blue cell is in the input grid.\\\\n7. To make the output, You must first count the total number of blue cells in the grid. Then you should make them red in the output. However, if a blue cell is adjacent to two or more other blue cells (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), it should also turn its diagonal counterparts red in the output.\\\\n8. The transformation depends on the pattern of the blue cells in the input grid.  - If there are one or two blue cells along the top row or the left column of the input grid, then they change to red in the output.  - If the blue cells form a diagonal from top left to bottom right, then all the cells along the diagonal change to red, and the rest of the cells remain black.  - If the blue cells form an L-shape along the top and left edges of the input, then they change to red in the output.  - If there is an extra blue cell apart from the diagonal in the left-side row or top-side column of the input grid, then the extra blue cell and all the cells in its column or row change to red.   - The blue cells in any other positions are not transformed, so they remain black in the output.\\\\n9. To make the output, you should count the number of blue cells in the row, and then replace the first number of black cells equal to the count of blue cells with red color in the corresponding output row, starting from the left. Other cells should remain black.\\\\n10. To make the output, you have to check the presence of blue cells in the input. Replace every blue cell found in symmetrical positions across the diagonal axis running from the top left corner to the bottom right corner with red cells. If some symmetrical positions are not filled with blue cells, keep them as black.\\\\n11. To make the output, you have to count the number of blue cells in the input. If there is just one blue cell, replace it with red. If there are two blue cells, replace those cells with red and the cell diagonally opposite to the blue cell, which is in the same quadrant (top left or top right or lower left or lower right), is also replaced by red. If there are three blue cells, replace all the cells in the first row with red and replace the cell in the center of the second row with red. This transformation rule scales regardless of the size and position of the input blue cells.\\\\n12. The transformation involves looking at both the rows and the columns of the grid.   If in any row, there is one or more blue cell, the equivalent cell in the first row of the output grid becomes red.   If there is one or more blue cell in any column, the equivalent cell in the first column of the output grid becomes red.  For example, if there\\'s a blue cell for the first and second cell in the first row of the input grid, the first and second cell in the first row of the output grid becomes red. Similarly, if there\\'s a blue cell for the second cell in the first and second column of the input grid, the second cell in the first column of the output grid will become red.   The rest of the grid is always black.\\\\n13. To transform the input into the output, you need to form a diagonal line passing from the top left cell to the bottom right cell. Place this line in the output grid and color it with red if there\\'s a blue cell in both cells that it passes over in the input grid. For example, if there are blue cells in the top middle and middle right cells of the input, color the top left and middle middle cells of the output with red. If they do not form a line, color only the top left cell, indicating a single appearance. Any 3 blue cells forming a line segment should be replaced with a full red diagonal.\\\\n14. The rule is to change all occurrences of 1 in the top row of the input to 2 in the corresponding output top row. In addition, if a 1 appears anywhere in the column below a transformed 1, it also changes to a 2. All other cells remain the same.\\\\n15. The transformation from input to output follows a specific pattern. For each row in the input:  - If there are no colored cells in the row, the output will be a row of black cells. - If there is one colored cell, the first cell of that row in the output will become red. - If there are two colored cells, the first two cells of that row in the output will become red. - If there are three colored cells, the entire row in the output will become red.   Additionally, if a column has colored cells in all three rows of the input, the middle cell of that column in the output will also become red, regardless of the number of colored cells in its row.\\\\n16. To make the output, you have to transform the grid by defining a path that starts from top left to top right and then goes vertically to the bottom right. All cells that fall under this path (inclusive) and have a blue color in the input grid should be changed to red in the output. Everything else remains black.   Note that the pattern should always run through the middle of grid. If there is no blue cell in the defined path in the input, there will be no red cell in the output. If there is more than one blue cell in the path in the input, all those cells are transformed to red in the output.\\\\n17. To make the output, count the number of blue cells in the entire grid. If the count is less than or equal to 2, make the top-left cell red. For the count between 3 and 4, both the first and the second cells on the top row should be red. If the count is more than 4, then the whole top row should be red. Blue cells in other positions of the top row of input grid will turn black. For the middle row, if there is a blue cell on the left-most position of the top or bottom row of input grid, turn the middle cell of this row to red. Otherwise keep it black. All the other positions in the output grid should be black.\\\\n18. To make the output, you have to fill all cells which are in the same row or column as a blue cell in the input grid with the color red (representing by number 2). Keep all other cells the same color as they were in the input grid (black).\\\\n19. The pattern involves the top row and left column. Every intersection (or overlap) between a blue cell on the first row and a blue cell on the first column should turn into a red cell on output. So in the output grid, the position of a red cell show that there is a blue cell located at those same indices of the top row and left column in the input.\\\\n20. The transformation from the input grid to the output grid involves changing color from blue to red based on a specific pattern. Here, each row, column and both the diagonals are treated as a sequence. In each sequence, change the blue squares to red squares if two or more blue squares exist in the sequence. The remaining blue squares, if any, are copied as it is. The black squares remain the same as well.\\\\n21. To make the output, apply the following transformation: count the number of colored squares (blue - 1s) in the input grid and change the same number of top left-most squares into a different color (red - 2s) in the output grid starting from the top left corner and moving right row by row. Transform the remaining squares into black (0s).\\\\n22. The transformation rule involves replacing every blue square in the input grid\\'s left-most column with a red square if it has a blue square anywhere to its right in the same row. All other squares, whether they are black or blue, remain the same in the output grid.\\\\n23. If a blue square is present anywhere in the row of the input grid, color the first square of that row red (2) in the output. For the output in the middle column, look only at the first column of input: if a blue square is present anywhere, color the middle square of the first row red. Repeat this for the second and third square of the middle row. If a blue square is at the bottom of the last column in the input, color the last square of the middle column red.\\\\n24. The transformation results from matching the positions of all the blue cells in the input grid and replacing them with red cells in the output grid. The black cells in the input grid should remain as black cells in the output grid. After replacing blue cells with red, the remaining cells of the row or column that contain the most blue cells in the input grid are also turned red. If there\\'s a tie, all tied rows or columns have the remaining cells turned red.\\\\n25. To make the output, you have to replace any blue square that has another blue square next to it (horizontally or vertically), with a red square. If a blue square in the input has no blue squares next to it, it remains black in the output. All the untouched black squares remain black in the output.\\\\n26. To make the output, you have to change all the blue cells in the top row to red (2) if there is at least one blue cell in the top row. Repeat the same for the middle row, but only change it if there is at least one blue cell in both the top and middle rows. The bottom row is always left unchanged. All black cells (0) remain black in the output grid.\\\\n27. To make the output, you have to count the occurrences of blue blocks in each column. Replace blue blocks with red blocks in rows of the output grid for which the blue block count equals or exceeds the row number on a one-based index (i.e. starting with row number 1). All other blocks remain black.\\\\n28. To make the output, you have to change the blue cells in the input grid based on its position. All the blue cells in the input grid which are on the same diagonal from left top corner to right bottom corner should be colored in Red. All remaining cells should be left black.\\\\n29. To make the output, imagine you are casting a vertical ray of light from above the grid downwards. Wherever a blue orb is hit by the light, it transforms itself and any blue orbs directly below it on the same column into a red orb. The transformation stops at the row that the first original blue orb was located if there is no blue orb in the downward direction on the same column.\\\\n30. The transformation from the input to the output is based on a rule regarding the positions of the blue cells.  In the output, if a blue cell is located in the same horizontal line as another blue cell in the input, all cells in the corresponding horizontal line in the output turn red.   It means that a blue cell can either be in the row above, at the same row, or the row below to create a red horizontal line. If there is no blue cell to fulfil these conditions, then the cells in the corresponding row stay black.   It\\'s important to note that this doesn\\'t affect the vertical lines. Only the horizontal lines can turn red in the output.\\\\n31. To make the output, you have to change any blue square that is a part of a line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) of at least two adjacent blue squares to red. All other blue squares as well as black squares remain the same.\\\\n32. To make the output, you have to change every blue cell located along the main diagonal from the top left to the bottom right to red. Additionally, look along the secondary diagonal from top-right to bottom-left, and if all cells that are blue in the input along this secondary diagonal should have their corresponding cells changed to red in the output grid.\\\\n33. Looking at the first row of the grid, if there\\'s a blue cell, then replace the corresponding cell in the first row of the output grid with red. Repeat this process for all cells in the first row. If there\\'s a blue cell in the second or third row of the input grid, replace the cell two rows above in the same column in the output grid with red. Repeat this process for each cell. If a cell isn\\'t replaced with red, it remains black.\\\\n34. The transformation is based on the position of the blue squares in the input grid. You need to substitute the blue squares in each row with orange square(s) in the corresponding row of the output. If there is more than one blue square in a given row in the input grid, orange squares will be placed to form a continuous line starting from the left. The black squares remain as is in the output grid.\\\\n35. To make the output, you have to identify cells in the input grid that have blue cells in the same relative position in the rows or columns. Mark these cells on the output grid with a red cell. The rest of the cells in the output grid should remain black.\\\\n36. To make the output, first identify the blue colored cells, then replace it with red color in the corresponding cell in the output grid. But if there is another blue cell horizontally or vertically adjacent to the identified blue cell, also replace this adjacent cell with red color in the output grid. All other cells remain black.\\\\n37. The transformation involves changing each blue cell into red, if any neighboring cell (vertical, horizontal and diagonal positions around the given cell) is also blue. Black cells remain unchanged.\\\\n38. To make the output, you have to change the color of the cells in the output grid based on the following rule - for each row in the input grid, if there are one or more blue cells, color the leftmost cell in that row in the output grid as red, otherwise leave it as black.\\\\n39. To generate the output grid from the input grid, a transformation rule should be applied to the input grid: 1. Count the number of blue squares in the input grid, if the count is greater than or equal to 3, color the square red in the corresponding row of the first column in the output grid. Repeat this for all the rows. 2. If there is a blue square in the top left to bottom right diagonal of the input grid, then color the square red in the corresponding row of the second column in the output grid. Repeat this for all the rows in the second column. 3. If there is a blue square in the bottom left to top right diagonal of the input grid, then color the square red in the corresponding row of the third column in the output grid. Repeat this for all the rows in the third column.  Note that after the transformations, all other squares should remain black.\\\\n40. The transformation involves replacing any cell in the top row of the grid with a red number (2) if there is a blue cell (1) anywhere vertically below it in the same column. All other cells retain their original values.\\\\n41. To make the output, each blue square in the input turns red in the output. Furthermore, the output also includes red squares in positions that are diagonally adjacent to the positions of the blue squares in the input. All other positions in the output are black.\\\\n42. To make the output, you have to count the number of 1s (blue cells) in the input grid and output as 2s (red cells) at their corresponding position. The rest of the output grid is zero.\\\\n43. To get the output grid from the input, you need to replace the first blue cell with a red cell. If there is a second blue cell, you replace it with a red cell as well. However, the replacement is dependent on the direction of the blue cells. If the blue cells are on the same row or the same column, then they are replaced sequentially from left to right or top to bottom. If the blue cells are on a diagonal, then the blue cell in the higher row and column is replaced first followed by the other blue cell. If there is a third blue cell, it is left as it is. All black cells are left as they are.\\\\n44. To make the output, you have to replace the blue cells based on their arrangement. If there is a blue cell above the current one, change the current cell to red, otherwise leave it black. If the blue cell is to the left or right or below the current cell, consider it to not exist.\\\\n45. The pattern follows a rule that changes blue cells (1) to red cells (2) depending on their position in the grid.   The condition for change is as follows: If the blue cell is alone or adjacent (vertical or horizontal, not diagonal) to another blue cell, it is turned to red. If not, it remains as it was. The rest of the cells remain the same.\\\\n46. To make the output, you have to replace each row and column that contains at least one blue square with red squares except for the black squares. All rows and columns that don\\'t contain a blue square are turned black.\\\\n47. To make the output, the grid maintains the original position of the cells, changed from blue (1) to red (2), if the blue cell is on the same column as any other blue cell. Otherwise, if the blue cell is alone in its column, it will remain unchanged.\\\\n48. To make the output, you have to replace all the blue cells with red cells (number 2) for each column which contains at least two blue cells. If a column has less than two blue cells, then the output is the same as the input.\\\\n49. The transformation involves checking each cell in the provided grid. If a cell is blue, check the cells to the left, right, above, and below it. If any of these cells are blue as well, the cell at the corresponding position in the output grid should be red. If it is at the edge and it is blue, it also becomes red. All other cells should be black.\\\\n50. To make the output, you have to go through each cell in the grid and apply the following: - If the cell is black, leave it black. - If the cell is blue, look at its immediate vertical and horizontal neighbors (up, down, left, and right). If there is at least one blue cell among these neighbors, turn the cell in the output grid red. If there is no blue cell among the neighbors, leave the cell in the output grid black. Please note that for cells at the corner and edges that don\\'t have four neighbors, only consider the available neighbors for the transformation.\\\\n51. The rule here seems to be related to the number of blue squares and their placement in the grid. Specifically, every blue square in the input grid and all the squares that are in the same row or column as it change to red in the output grid. All other squares remain black. This transformation resembles the operation of rooks in chess, with the blue squares in the input grid serving as the rooks.\\\\n52. To make the output, a rule is followed - whenever there is a blue point in the input, the corresponding place in the output becomes red if there is at least one more blue point in the same row or column of the input; otherwise, it turns black. All other spots in the output which do not have a blue point in the same position in the input should stay black.\\\\n53. To make the output, you have to turn the first cell of each row that contains a blue cell red. If there are no blue cells in a row, leave all cells in that row black. Also, if there is a blue cell in the middle column, change the second cell of the middle row red; if not, leave it black.\\\\n54. The transformational pattern seems to be taking the blue color (1) in the grid as a positional reference. If any cell in the grid has neighbor (direct or diagonally) colored cells in the input, the corresponding cell in the output grid becomes red (2). If the cell is blue but doesn\\'t have any colored neighbors, it remains blue in the output grid. All other cells remain black (0).\\\\n55. To make the output, you scan the input from top to bottom and from left to right, and for each blue cell you encounter, replace it with a red cell and also fill in a red cell in the corresponding position of the upper row in the output if it\\'s black. If that cell is in the top row, ignore it. Continue this process until all cells in the input have been scanned.\\\\n56. To make the output, you have to identify any blue squares in the input grid. If the blue square has any blue square as its adjacent square (top, bottom, left or right), change it to red. If it is not adjacent to any blue squares, it remains blue.  Note: The diagonal squares or squares with a common vertex are not considered adjacent.\\\\n57. The pattern of the transformation can be determined by the number of blue squares in the grid rows. Change the color of a black square into red in every row where there are two or more squares in that row. Multiple red squares can be placed in the same row, but only at places where there was previously a blue square.\\\\n58. To make the output, consider each blue box and its neighboring boxes. Turn a blue box into red (number 2) if it has at least one blue neighbor in the same row or the same column. Keep all other boxes same as black (number 0).\\\\n59. To make the output, you need to count the number of blue cells around any given cell, including the cell itself. If the count is more than or equal to 2, transform this cell to red cell. Otherwise, keep it black.\\\\n60. To make the output, you have to scan through the input and whenever you see a blue cell, check its neighbouring cells (on the left, right, up, and down). If any of its neighbour is a blue cell, make the cell in the output grid and its neighbor, red. Repeat the process for every cell in the input grid. For positions that don\\'t become red, the cell will remain black in the output grid.\\\\n61. To form the output grid, identify all cells containing a blue value in the input grid. For each blue cell, mark the corresponding cell and all cells to the left (given they are non-black in the input grid) in the output grid as red. Essentially, the transformation involves carrying the pattern of the top blue cells and replicating it to all cells to the left of the same row.\\\\n\"}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "Category 1: Rules involving the transformation of blue cells based on their adjacency to other blue cells.\n- Rule: If a blue cell is adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to at least one other blue cell, transform it to red in the output grid.

For each category, synthesize the rules into a single, specific rule that combines the ideas of all rules in that category, while clearly differentiating it from the other categories.\\\\nThe new rule should be as specific as possible, following the format of the given rules.\\\\nThe new rule should be applicable without any information from the original rules - i.e. it should be standalone.\\\\n\\\\nRules:\\\\n1. To make the output, you need to cut the input grid in half vertically,  keeping the left half as the resulting output grid.\\\\n2. To make the output, you have to cut the repeated pattern in the middle leaving out half of the input.\\\\n3. To get the output from the input, simply discard the latter half of the columns in the input grid. The output is the first half of the columns in the original input grid.\\\\n4. To make the output, you have to remove the second half of the input grid. In other words, only the first half of each row from the input grid is considered for the output grid.\\\\n5. To make the output, the transformation involves taking the left half of the input grid. The right half of the grid is effectively \\'removed\\' or \\'snipped off\\'.\\\\n6. To make the output, you have to retain only the unique occurrences of the patterns in each row, eliminating repeating patterns. If a repeating number pattern occurs in a row, that pattern is removed during the transformation to create the output grid. Hence, every row repeats itself in the output grid just once.\\\\n7. To make the output, you have to only keep the left hand side of the input grid. Essentially, the input grid is split down the middle, and the right half is discarded to produce the output.\\\\n8. The output grid is constructed by truncating every row of the input grid by removing the second half of each row.\\\\n9. To create the output, you have to remove the right half of the existing array, thus removing the mirrored repetition.\\\\n10. To make the output, you have to take the first half of each row of the input grid and discard the rest.\\\\n11. To make the output, you have to take the first half of each row in the input grid and delete the remainder.\\\\n12. For making the output, you need to take the first half of the input grid squares on each line (row by row from left to right). This is similar to a split operation, where you keep the first half and discard the second half on each row.\\\\n13. To make the output, you have to take only the first half of the columns from the input grid. The entire input grid is duplicated along the horizontal axis, hence taking the first half will give the original pattern.\\\\n14. To make the output, you have to remove the repeated pattern in every row. Only the left half of each row should be copied to the output.\\\\n15. To generate the output, you need to cut the input grid in half from top to bottom, right down the middle. The left half of the grid becomes the output.\\\\n16. Each row of the output is created from the first half of the corresponding row of the input grid.\\\\n17. To make the output, the transformation process would involve eliminating the duplicate columns in the input grid. This causes the resulting output grid to have only the unique column patterns.\\\\n18. To make the output, you need to remove the repeated second half of the pattern from each row in the input. Hence, the output contains only the first intermitted patterns in each row from the input.\\\\n19. To make the output, you have to remove the right half of the grid.

To make the output, you have to remove every second column in the input grid starting from the second column. From left you should only keep the first, third, fifth and so on columns moving to the right. Apply this rule until you reach grid symmetric center.\\\\n23. To make the output, you have to remove the right half of each row, keeping only the first set of repeated patterns.\\\\n24. To make the output, you have to remove the second half (or repetition) of the grid. The transformation simply eliminates the repeated pattern present in the right half of the input grid.\\\\n25. To make the output, you have to take the left half of the input grid. Ignore the right half of the input grid when transforming to the output grid.\\\\n26.

If the input grid has an odd number of columns, still mirror the left half excluding the middle column.\\\\n36. To make the output, identify the division line that halves the input grid into two identical parts either vertically or horizontally. Discard one half to get the output. The division line is determined by the layout itself, for wider grids vertical division is sought, for taller grids horizontal division is applied, and for square grids either direction can work.\\\\n37. To make the output, you have to keep only the first half columns of the input grid. Cut the grid in half vertically, and discard the second half.\\\\n38.

Ignore the second mirrored half.\\\\n42. To make the output, you have to remove the second half of each row in the input grid. Keep only the first few items in each row so that the repeating pattern only appears once.\\\\n43. To make the output, split the input grid vertically in half, then discard the right half. This leaves you with the left half of the input grid which is the output. To determine the split point, the number of columns in the grid should be divided by 2. If the number of columns is an odd number, round down to the nearest integer after dividing by 2.\\\\n44. To transform the input into the output grid, disregard the right pattern and extract the left pattern, copying it directly into the output.\\\\n45. To make the output, you need to remove the duplicate parts of the grid. If the grid is duplicated horizontally you halve its width, and if its duplicated vertically, you halve its height.\\\\n46. To make the output, you have to divide the input grid in half horizontally. Keep the left half and discard the right half.\\\\n47. To make the output, you have to take the first half of the original grid, ignoring the repeated part.\\\\n48.

To make the output, you have to remove the repeated patterns from the input grid, by keeping the left half of the original input grid.\\\\n53. To create the output, you have to split every row in half based on its length. Only retain the first half of every row and discard the second half.\\\\n54. To make the output, you have to remove every second column from the input grid starting from the second column (if we start counting from 1). In other words, keep the odd numbered columns and remove the even numbered ones.\\\\n55. To make the output, you have to only take the left half of the input grid, regardless of the input size. The output grid should contain all the rows of the left half of the input grid.\\\\n56. To make the output, we take the left half of the input grid. In other words, if the input grid is of size m x n, the output grid will be of size m x n/2, where every row in the output grid corresponds to the left half of the same row in the input grid. This implies discarding the right half of the input grid.\\\\n57. To make the output, you need to take the left half of the input grid and copy it to the output grid.\\\\n58. To make the output, you have to keep only the first half number of columns of the input grid. Exclude or remove the second half columns from the input to get the output grid.\\\\n59. To make the output, you have to retain the left half of the input grid. Ignore the squares in the right half of the input grid.\\\\n60.

To make the output, you have to perform tile filling. For each non-colored block, we need to repeat the cell pattern right after them, filling in the same colors until black cells appear. Keep in mind that the pattern ends if it meets a black cell, and then it starts over with the first color of the next block.\\\\n2. To make the output, if you see a colored bar with less than eight colors, extend the pattern you see in the bar to fill the entire 8x1 bar. The cells that were empty in the input should retain the same color in the output. Keep the black bars as black.\\\\n3. To transform the input into the output, you need to replicate the color patterns found in each segmented row across the black spaces within the same row. The pattern always starts from the left and repeats itself until it fills the entire row. However, the black rows and rows that already have a filled color pattern remain the same.\\\\n4. To make the output, you have to repeat the pattern of colored numbers (excluding zeros) from the beginning of each line till the end of the line, replacing the zeros in process.\\\\n5. In order to transform the input into the output, mirror the pattern of the numbered squares in each row from the left to the right i.e. repeat the sequence of coloured squares in each row filling up the black squares.\\\\n6. In the colors row, there is a pattern of first 3 colors repeated twice in the rest of the row. This pattern is applied to every color row in the grid. The black rows remain the same as in the input grid.\\\\n7. To make the output, you have to take the four colored cell pattern that repeats twice in the second row of the grid and replicate it in the other rows that have colored cells, replacing the existing pattern. Keep the black rows as they are.\\\\n8. To make the output grid from the input grid, identify the rows with the sequences of colored cells which also contains black cells. In these rows, the sequence of colored cells gets replicated till it fills the row. For instance, if the original sequence in such a row were [8, 8, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], the output sequence will become [8, 8, 2, 8, 8, 2, 8, 8]. All other rows of the output grid remain same as the corresponding rows in the input grid.\\\\n9. To make the output, you have to copy the existing pattern of symbols in each row and repeat it until the end of the row. Black boxes and black rows remain unchanged.\\\\n10. To make the output, you have to complete the existing color pattern in each row, replicating the initial color sequence until the row ends. Every color pattern in a row is independent from others: it could be shorter or longer, and with different colors. Every occurence of black cells should be replaced in the output.\\\\n11. To make the output, you have to fill the black spaces in the coloured rows by repeating the sequence of colours present in that row. The sequence should restart right after the last colour of the sequence already given.\\\\n12. To make the output, you have to express each colored block line as a repeating pattern. For example if the line has colors (3,2,1 and remaining block is black), you should repeat the pattern (3,2,1) till the end of the line. Keep all the black blocks as it is.\\\\n13. To make the output, you have to repeat the sequence of colored cells in rows that contain colors. If there\\'s a black cell in the original colored rows, repeat the sequence from the beginning until all black cells are filled. The black rows of the original input remain black in the output.\\\\n14. First, look the series of blocks in the certain rows of the grid. Identify the pattern and extend this pattern across the entire row. Replace all the remaining black blocks in that row with this pattern. Repeat this for all rows that contain colored blocks. Leave blank rows as they are.\\\\n15. To make the output, you need to repeat the pattern of colors across the whole line. Whichever color comes first in the line should also come first in the repeated pattern, keeping the same order in which they appear. If there\\'s only one color in the line, then that color should be repeated across the whole line as well. Black spaces in the line should be filled by the repeated pattern.\\\\n16. To transform the grid to make the output, you have to examine each pair of colored cells in those specific rows that contain color. If you encounter a black cell after the pair, you have to repeat the sequence of colored cells until you fill the row. Leave the black cells in other rows as they are.\\\\n17. To transform the input grid into the output grid, repeat the first three cells of the rows that have colors till the end of that row, in the same order. Other black cells remain the same. This is equivalent to mirroring the first three cells across the position of the black cells in the row. Specifically, each row with colored cells is filled with the cycle of the first three colored cells, and all the rest is filled with blacks.\\\\n18. To get the output grid, duplicate the pattern of numbers on the left of each line over the remainder of the line to the right. The order of numbers and the size of the blocks of color should repeat over the rest of the row, ignoring the black cells.\\\\n19. To make the output, you have to repeat the sequence of colors for the remaining black cells in the colored line. The sequence is sourced from the colored cells that occur before the corresponding black cells in the same line. Even if the colored cells in a line form less than half of the total cells, the sequence perpetuates to fill up the remaining black cells in the same line. Black lines and other cells in the grid remain unchanged.\\\\n20. To get the output from the input, duplicate the first three cells from the beginning of the colored rows to fill the remaining black boxes in the row. Ensure that the pattern repeats in the order they appear, until all black boxes in the rows have been replaced.\\\\n21. The transformation involves repeating the pattern displayed on the 3 leftmost cells of each row with stripes from left to right, until the end of the row. The black spaces on these rows get filled with the repeated pattern. The black rows in the grid remain black.\\\\n22. To obtain the output, we need to duplicate the first 3 colors of every row where two different colors are followed by black cells, in such a way that the two different colors alternate until filling the rest of the row. The rule does not apply to rows that have 4 color cells repeating or rows that are totally black. They remain the same.\\\\n23. To make the output, repeat the pattern found in the coloured blocks and fill up the black space with this pattern until the row is full. The pattern repeats from the start of the row after the existing blocks, ignoring the position of the black spaces in the input. The pattern does not carry over to the next row.\\\\n24. In order to create the output grid from the input grid, you need to fill the remaining black cells on each colored line with the colors from the beginning of that line, repeating the sequence of those first colored cells along the rest of the line till the end.\\\\n25. To make the output, you have to repeat the pattern of  colored boxes on the first part of each colored line till fill the line. Do not alter the rest of the grid.\\\\n26. To make the output, you have to repeat the pattern in each colored line until it fills the entire row. The pattern should keep the original order of the colors.\\\\n27. To make the output, you have to repeat the three different colors found in the colored rows across the empty space in the row until the end. The repeating pattern should stay the same as the initial three colors in each row.\\\\n28. To make the output, you have to replicate the pattern of colored cells from the second row of colored cells into the first row of colored cells from the left to right ignoring the black cells. After that, the pattern should be repeated in all the remaining cells of the respective row.\\\\n29. To make the output, you need to repeat the configuration of colored boxes in each colored row across the previously black boxes. The pattern should be maintained. If a row begins with black, it remains black but if it has colored boxes, repeat the pattern of colored boxes until the end of the row.\\\\n30. To form the output, you have to repeat the pattern of the colored part in each colored line across all the black part of that line. The color and the pattern that starts the line gets copied throughout the rest of that line. The black lines stay black.\\\\n31. To make the output, you have to repeat the pattern of the colored squares in each row throughout the row, replacing any black squares.\\\\n32. To make the output, you need to extend the pattern of colors on each colored row across the entire row, replicating the pattern of colors precisely and repeating it as many times as needed to fill the row. The black rows remain unchanged.\\\\n33. The non-black rows follow a repeating pattern. In the output, these patterns are duplicated to fill the entire row, replacing black cells on the right with the corresponding cell from the left side of the row, beginning from the first coloured cell and continuing the pattern until the end of the row.\\\\n34. To make the output, you have to repeat the sequence of colored numbers in the second row and fifth row until the end of the row. This pattern must be repeated for each row with colored numbers in the input grid. The remaining black cells stay the same.\\\\n35. To make the output, you have to replicate the pattern of colored boxes across the band where it\u2019s present. For example, if a band has blue, blue, red followed by blacks, it should be transformed to a band with repeated sequences of blue, blue, red until the band is filled.\\\\n36. To make the output, you have to repeat the pattern of non-zero numbers in a row until it fills all the zeros in the second half of the same row.\\\\n37. To make the output, you have to repeat the pattern found in the beginning of the colored lines, disregarding the black cells, and fill the line with this pattern.\\\\n38. To make the output, you have to recognize the pattern in the colored lines and repeat them across the whole line, replacing the black cells. The pattern from the original line will always start from the first cell of its line in the grid and will go on repeating it throughout the line preserving the order of colors in the original pattern.\\\\n39. For transforming the input grid to output, securely keep the rows with black cells as it is. For the colored pattern rows, just repeat the pattern till the end of the row.\\\\n40. To make the output, you have to replicate the initial pattern of non-black cells in each horizontal line across the rest of the line replacing the black cells. The replication should recycle the pattern as necessary. The spaces/blocks which are initially non-black in each of these specified horizontal lines will retain their colors in the output. All other non-black cells including those in the lines which do not have any non-black cells initially will remain unchanged.\\\\n41. To make the output, you have to repeat the colored pattern found in each colored stripe, from left to right, until the end of the row. The black stripes are left the same.\\\\n42. To make the output, copy the pattern of colors in every colored line and stretch them to fill the rest of the line, repeat the pattern from the left to the right. All the black lines remain unchanged.\\\\n43. To make the output, you have to repeat the colored sequence four times. Each sequence in input is copied once and then repeated two more times to fill the rest of the row. The black cells remain unchanged.\\\\n44. For each colored line in the input, repeat the pattern of the first three squares in that line to fill the entire line. Leave blank lines unchanged.\\\\n45. To transform the input grid into the output grid, the pattern of colored cells in each colored row is repeated to fill the remainder of that row. The pattern remains intact but is just extended to fill the entire row till the end. The black cells remain unchanged.\\\\n46. The transformation consists of repeating the pattern of colored cells observed at the beginning of certain rows throughout the rest of that row. This occurs for every row that starts with a colored pattern, every other part of the grid remains the same.\\\\n47. To make the output, you need to repeat the pattern from the second box in each non-black line until the end of the line. The pattern consists of a double box of one color, a single box of another color. This pattern should be repeated in each non-black row until the end. For black rows, copy them as they are.\\\\n48. To make the output, you have to repeat the pattern of colored blocks in the line until it fills the entire row. This pattern should continue to the right from the last colored block in the row.\\\\n49. To make the output, you have to replace the black cells in each colored line with the pattern of colored cells from the beginning of that line, repeating the pattern if necessary to fill all the cells in the line. The pattern does not extend past the initial colored cells of each line. Black lines remain unchanged.\\\\n50. To make the output, you have to replicate the color sequence in the middle sections of 8 cells across each of these rows, covering the black cells. This creates a repeating pattern across the entire width of these colored rows.\\\\n51. To make the output, you have to repeat the first small sequence of colored blocks (which is at the beginning of each sequence) throughout the rest of that sequence. The pattern is set on the left side of the sequence and the black cells on the right side are filled with continuing repetition of this pattern. The rows of black cells are not changed.\\\\n52. To make the output, copy the pattern of colors from the first three cells in each colored line and repeat it until the end of the line. Leave the rows with only black cells as they are.\\\\n53. To make the output, you have to repeat the three color boxes patterns inherent in each colour line across all the color boxes within the same line. In essence, if a colored line has three boxes with colors A, B, B and the remaining part of the line is color A, then replace the remaining part with a repeat pattern of A, B, B.\\\\n54. If a row in the grid has colored squares, copy the pattern of the colored squares in the row and fill the remaining part of the row with the same pattern. In each row, the pattern begins at the left-most position and continues right across the row. If a row does not have any colors (all black), then leave the row as it is.\\\\n55. To make the output, you have to repeat the sequences of coloured numbers found on the lines with coloured numbers across all the columns. The blank lines remain blank.\\\\n56. To transform the input into the output, copy the defined color sequence in each row to fill remaining black cells in that row. The color sequence stops repeating where the next color sequence starts. Black rows stay the same.\\\\n57. To make the output, you have to take the first 4 colored cells on each non-empty row and repeat them twice to fill out the whole row. You will still have a gap of black cells between each colored row. The pattern of colors remains unchanged while filling the row.\\\\n58. The transformation involves duplicating the pattern of numbers in each colored band that has more than one colored number. For instance, if a band starts with \\'8 8 2 0 0 0 0 0\\', the \\'0\\'s should be replaced by a repetition of the pattern \\'8 8 2\\' to get \\'8 8 2 8 8 2 8 8\\'. Bands with a single colored number are left unchanged.\\\\n59. To make the output, you need to replicate the original pattern of each non-black line, repeating it within the line until it fills the grid, matching the size of the grid. This means if the line originally has two colored cells and the rest are black, in the output, these two colored cells will keep repeating side by side, replacing all the rest of the black cells within the same line.\\\\n60. To create the output grid, you need to fill in the cells within each colored row by repeating the sequence of colors found there until the end of the row. The all-black rows in the input remain the same in the output.\\\\n61. To make the output, you have to repeat the pattern of colored cells in the colored rows throughout the rest of the row. For black rows, no changes are made.\\\\n62. To obtain the output grid, you need to copy and repeat the first four elements in each colored row to the right part of the same row, ensuring that there are eight elements in total for each colored row. The empty spaces should be maintained as they are.\\\\n63. To make the output, you need to fill the half-filled color rows with another set of pattern repeating in a mirrored fashion. For example, if in the colored row, first 4 boxes are blue, orange, blue, orange and then followed by 4 black boxes, the 4 black boxes will be filled in a mirrored fashion of first 4 making it orange, blue, orange, blue.\\\\n\"}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "After analyzing the rules, they can be categorized into eight distinct categories based on their similarities.

For each category, synthesize the rules into a single, specific rule that combines the ideas of all rules in that category, while clearly differentiating it from the other categories.\\\\nThe new rule should be as specific as possible, following the format of the given rules.\\\\nThe new rule should be applicable without any information from the original rules - i.e. it should be standalone.\\\\n\\\\nRules:\\\\n1. To go from the input to the output: - For the areas inside the \\\\\\'8\\\\\\' figures, turn these slots from blue to red or orange (2 or 7).  - The rest of the grid remains the same.  Note: You can identify the areas enclosed by the \\\\\\'8\\\\\\' by following the non-black squares in each 8-figure. The squares inside them, i.e., squares not on the 8-figure boundary or the outside of the 8, are the ones to transform.\\\\n2. To make the output, you have to fill the inside of the blue zero-like figures with other colors, for top half - dark pink, for bottom half - orange. The outline of the figures remains blue and the rest of the grid remains unchanged.\\\\n3. To make the output, you have to change the color of blue grid squares within the rectangles. Keep the bordering line of the rectangle in blue, but change all the blue squares inside the rectangle to red. The remaining black squares should stay black.\\\\n4. To make the output, you have to change the blue squares that are contained within the shape (i.e., are surrounded by blue squares and not connected to the edge of the grid) to either Fuschia or Teal. If the shape is at the top of the grid, the interior should be changed to Fuschia; if the shape is at the bottom, the interior should be changed to Teal.\\\\n5. To make the output, you have to change the blue cells which form square or rectangular sections inside each separate blue section of the input to another color. For the top blue section change those blue cells to orange, and for the bottom section to grey.\\\\n6. The transformation involves filling the blue shapes (geometrical representation of letters). The output grid keeps the original blue form, but colors the interior squares with either red or green. The red (marked as \\\\\\'7\\\\\\') or green (marked as \\\\\\'2\\\\\\') is put exactly in those squares that have at least one of its four neighbouring squares (up, down, left, right) black. In other words, the transformation fills the inner part of the blue forms on the input grid with different colors, red or green, while leaving the exterior markings blue.\\\\n7. To make the output, change all blue cells that are surrounded on all four sides by black cells to red, and similarly, for the bottom shape, change all blue cells surrounded on all four sides by black cells into light green. This means that the filled blue shape in the middle of each separate shape will transform its color in the output.\\\\n8. The transformation seems to depend on replacing the cells enclosed by the blue and red perimeter. Here\\\\\\'s how: Compare the pattern of cells in the top and bottom halves of the grid. Then, replace the cell colours within the blue and red perimeters as follows - if the corresponding cells within the perimeters in the top and bottom halves are the same (both black or both colored), color the cell in the output blue (the colour used in the top half); if the cells differ, color the cell in the output orange. The cells outside these perimeters remain the same.\\\\n9. To make the output, you have to change blue cells that are surrounded by other blue cells, excluding the border of squares and rectangles, into the red or teal correspondingly. If the figure doesn\\\\\\'t have a border (single line of blue cells), you leave it as it is.\\\\n10. To make the output, you have to fill the top blue empty area with brown and the bottom blue empty area with red. Keep black square as it.\\\\n11. The transformation maps each black square in the interior of the blue shapes (with the exception of the exterior borders of the shape) to a new color - green for the top shape, and orange for the bottom shape. The remaining blue squares (forming the borders of the shapes) and the black squares remain unchanged.\\\\n12. To make the output, Fill the inside of the blue rectangles or donuts on each side with a different color, while maintaining their original contours and shapes intact. Fill the inner part of the top rectangle or donut with red and the inner part of the bottom part with green.\\\\n13. The transformation involves changing the interior cells of the large square shapes. If a cell in the interior of the top square is black, it turns into teal (number 7). If a cell in the interior of the bottom square is black, it turns into red (number 2). The rest of the grid remains unchanged.\\\\n14. To get to the output, color the internal part of the blue rectangles. The cells inside the first rectangle get colored in the color which corresponds to the color code 7. The cells inside the second rectangle get colored in the color which corresponds to the color code 2.\\\\n15. To create the output, you should take the input and replace the pixels that are surrounded on six sides (above, down, left-right, and diagonal cells) by blue pixels with orange pixels (represented by 7). For those pixels that are surrounded on only four sides but not diagonally (left, right, top, bottom only), replace them with brown pixels (represented by 2). All other blue pixels from the input should remain the same as blue in the output. All black (0) pixels should be unchanged.\\\\n16. To make the output, you should identify the blue cells in the upper and lower square. Then you should replace the three blue cells forming the horizontal sides of both squares with brown cells and replace the four blue cells forming the vertical sides of both squares with gray cells, leaving the corners intact. All the rest of the cells should remain the same.\\\\n17. To create the output grid, identify the outside boundary of the large numbers and keep them in the same blue color. For the interior squares of each large number, change the color to a different color. The top number should have its interior filled with fuschia while the bottom number has its interior filled with red.\\\\n18. To make the output, you have to fill in the square frames in the following way: mark with \"7\" the cells inside the upper square and with \"2\" the cells inside the bottom square. The rest of the cells remain the same.\\\\n19. To make the output, you have to fill the hollow area inside of each blue square.  Fill the top square with grey cells and fill the bottom square with red cells. Remaining cells should stay the same.\\\\n20. To make the output, you have to firstly create a copy of the grid. Then, for each colored square in the colors not the boundary, you replace colors in the interior of the first figure with green, and interior of the second figure with red. Leave the rest of the grid as it is.\\\\n21. To make the output,  the cells of grid that are inside the \\\\\\'0\\\\\\' shape but aren\\\\\\'t on the boundary of the \\\\\\'0\\\\\\' shape are transformed from blue to red, while the rest of the grid remains the same. In other words, the interior of \\\\\\'0\\\\\\' shape is filled with red color while the boundary retains its blue color.\\\\n22. To make the output, you have to change the inner cells of the blue squares from blue to orange if the top left cell of the grid is black, and to red if the top left cell of the grid is blue. The boundary cells of the blue squares remain blue. The rest of the cells stay the same.\\\\n23. To make the output, you have to replace the interior of the squares, keeping the border cells unaltered. The top square\\\\\\'s inner cells are replaced with red cells, while the bottom square\\\\\\'s inner cells are replaced with green cells. The remainder of the grid is left unaltered.\\\\n24. To create the output grid, any group of blue blocks surrounded by black blocks on all sides should be transformed into fuchsia blocks if they are above the central horizontal line and into red blocks if they are below it. The blue blocks on the extreme top and bottom lines of the figures should be left unchanged. This transformation would seem like changing the color of the \\\\\\'inner parts\\\\\\' of the blue figures while leaving the \\\\\\'outline\\\\\\' blue.\\\\n25. To make the output, you have to transform the inside cells of the squares. The first (or upper) one is transformed by replacing blue cells with red cells. The second square (or lower one) is transformed by replacing blue cells with green cells. Black cells remain the same during the transformation.\\\\n26. To make the output, you have to change the all blue color inside the \\\\\\'R\\\\\\' and \\\\\\'O\\\\\\' letters to red while leaving the blue defining the shape of the letters. Leave the black color unchanged.\\\\n27. To obtain the output from the input, within every enclosed area originally filled with \"1\"s, replace this \"1\" with \"7\". Next, scan for the rectangles originally filled in the middle with \"0\"s. Inside these rectangles, replace the \"0\"s with \"2\"s. The remaining areas stay as they are.\\\\n28. To transform the input to output, in the first blue rectangle which starts from top, replace the inner blue cells bounded by outermost blue cells with green (excluding the outermost blue cells which form the boundary of rectangle). Similarly, for the second blue rectangle which starts from bottom, replace the inner blue cells bounded by outermost blue cells with red (excluding the outermost blue cells which form the boundary of rectangle). All other cells should be kept as-is.\\\\n29. The transformation involves altering the color within the square-shaped patterns. For the blue squares pattern if a blue box is surrounded by other blue boxes, it remains unchanged. If a blue box has black boxes on the sides, it turns to fuschia. For the red squares pattern, if a red box is surrounded by other red boxes, it remains unchanged. If a red box has black boxes on the sides, it turns to teal.\\\\n30. To make the output, you have to recognize the two blue squares in the input. Fill these squares with red, keeping the outline blue. Also, keep the line in the middle unchanged. All the black squares should remain black in the output.\\\\n31. The transformation fills in the empty regions within the non-black areas of the input grid. Inside the blue rectangular areas, the vacant spaces are filled with green (7) in the output grid. In the empty regions in the second and fourth quadrants, the blue rectangles are drawn and the inside of the rectangles are filled with red (2).  Therefore, the pattern can be summarized as: filled regions within the shapes in blue color (number 1) are turned to green (number 7) and vacant spaces inside the shapes in the second and fourth quadrants are filled with blue (number 1) and their interiors are filled with red (number 2).\\\\n32. To produce the resultant grid, follow the steps below: 1. For cells in the portion of the grid occupied by the blue (\\\\\\'1\\\\\\') digit outline, if the cell value in the input grid is black (0), change it to red (7) in the output grid. 2. For cells in the portion of the grid occupied by the blue (\\\\\\'0\\\\\\') digit outline, if the cell value in the input grid is black (0), change it to teal (2) in the output grid. 3. Keep all other cells the same as the input grid.\\\\n33. To make the output, you have to replace all pixels in the blue square in the form of a closed space with pink (7). However, the four corners must remain blue(1). Repeat this process for both the top and bottom blue squares.\\\\n34. To form the output, a transformation is applied on the shapes formed by the ones in both the top and bottom half of the grid. For the top half, every \\\\\\'1\\\\\\' surrounded (on all four sides - up, down, left and right) by at least three other \\\\\\'1\\\\\\'s (diagonal doesn\\\\\\'t count) changes into 7. For the bottom half of the grid where the other shape is formed, this rule is a bit different. There, every \\\\\\'1\\\\\\' surrounded by two other \\\\\\'1\\\\\\'s changes into 2. This fills up the shapes with these new numbers. If a \\\\\\'1\\\\\\' is on the border of the shape or is surrounded by less than the amount of other \\\\\\'1\\\\\\'s required, it remains a \\\\\\'1\\\\\\'. The middle \\\\\\'margin\\\\\\' rows of zeros remain unchanged.\\\\n35. To make the output, you have to change each black square inside a blue square to brown, but only if it is surrounded on all four sides by blue. The blue borders should remain untouched. This applies for both the upper and lower circles.\\\\n36. To make the output, you have to highlight the pixels inside each of the rectangles filled with 1s (blue), but excluding the border of the rectangle. For upper rectangle, we replace the 1s (blue) inside the rectangle with 7 (orange). For the lower rectangle, we replace the 1s (blue) inside the rectangle with 2 (red). The rest of the grid remains the same as the input.\\\\n37. To form the output grid from the input, focus on the blue square patterns.   - Look at the inner boxes of each square in the input.  - For the top square:   - If the box is blue, change it to red.   - If the box is black, keep it black. - For the bottom square:   - If the box is blue, change it to teal.   - If the box is black, keep it black.  Maintain the outside edge of both squares as blue and keep all the other black spaces as black.\\\\n38. The transformation rule is as follows: Within each shape, convert the existing blue tiles surrounded by other blue tiles on all sides to red tiles. Elsewhere, leave the grid as it is. Thus, the rectangular or square periphery of the shape remains blue while the interior is all red. All empty space remains as is.\\\\n39. The transformation includes the interior of any enclosed blue region. The transformation does not change the blue border. However, the enclosed black pixels in the top region are morphed to an orange (7) pixel. In the bottom region, the center blue pixels morph to a green (2) pixel. Everything else is left unchanged.\\\\n40. To make the output, you have to change all blue cells inside the blue squares but not on the blue boundary line to green. Keep the black cells as black. The blue boundary line remains as it is (blue).\\\\n41. To make the output, you have to change the number of the color inside of each blue digit \"8\". All values within the \"8\" on the top are changed to red, and all those in the bottom are changed to fuschia.\\\\n42. To make the output, you\\\\\\'ll need to fill in the outlined sections with a different color, but you must keep the outline. The top section should be filled in with a pink color represented by the number 7, and the bottom section should be filled in with a teal color represented by the number 2. Make sure the original outline in blue represented by the number 1 is unchanged.\\\\n43. To make the output, you have to replace the part of the letter that has blue cells surrounded by other blue cells on all four sides (like the middle segment of \"E\") with orange cells. The cells surrounded by other blue cells from both top and bottom (like top and bottom segments of \"E\") should be replaced with green cells. All other blue and black cells remain as they are.\\\\n44. To generate the output, you have to change the inner blue squares to red. The outer blue square remains as is. In detail, you should change the blue cells that have neighboring black cells horizontally or vertically to red. The corner cells inside the outer blue square should also become red.\\\\n45. To make the output, you have to color the inside of the squares. The inside of the top square should be colored orange and the inside of the bottom square should be colored red. Only the cells that were black inside the squares should be colored - the blue lines forming the squares should stay the same.\\\\n46. If a blue cell is surrounded on all sides (including diagonally) by other blue or edge cells, change it to a dark pink (fuschia, value 7), if it is in the upper square. If the cell is in the lower square, change it to a teal(8). Transformations should not affect cells on the edge of the grid, nor should it affect black cells.\\\\n47. And here\\\\\\'s how to get from the input grid to the output grid:  1. Look for the letters formed by blue squares in the input grid. The letters could vary in size but are always enclosed by black squares.  2. For any blue square that is completely surrounded by black or blue squares on the North, East, South, and West points (N,E,S,W), turn it into a red square (let\\\\\\'s treat 7 as red).  3. For any blue square that is completely surrounded by black or blue squares on the diagonal points (NE,SE,SW,NW), turn it into a green square (let\\\\\\'s treat 2 as green).  4. For some complex letter formations, both point 2 and point 3 above could apply. In such cases, follow point 2. This is to say, a square that could be turned into a red or a green square, should be turned into a red square.  5. Leave the rest of the grid as is.\\\\n48. To make the output, you have to change the interior cells of the rectangular shapes. Each top block of blue cells - bordered by a series of blue cells to the left, right and bottom and a line of black cells above - should have all its interior cells changed to red (value 7). The bottom blocks of blue cells - bordered by a series of blue cells to the left, right and top and a line of black cells below - should have all its interior cells changed to green (value 2). The sequence between the top and bottom blocks of black cells should remain black.\\\\n49. To make the output, you have to change the color of the inside cells of each rectangle. All cells inside the top rectangle should change from blue to orange, and all cells inside the bottom rectangle should change from blue to red. The cells of the rectangle\\\\\\'s outline should remain blue. Any black cells in the grid should remain black in the output.\\\\n50. To make the output, you have to replace any blocks that are surrounded (on top, bottom, left and right) by the same color in the number 8 by a block of value 7. If the blocks are on the outer edges of the number 8, replace them with blocks of value 2.\\\\n51. To make the output, you have to focus on each section of blue squares individually. A section is composed of blue squares that are adjacent to each other (not diagonally).   Starting from the section at the top, color the inner squares of the section with red, while maintaining the outer border of blue squares as they are. Then, in the next section (going top to bottom), color the inner squares with green, keeping the outer blue border the same. Repeat this pattern alternating the red and green for each section from top to bottom. Any black (empty) rows remain unchanged.\\\\n52. To make the output, alter the empty block interiors of the blue grid in the input to form new blocks according to this process: 1. Replace blue boundaries in the upper grid with blue and its interior cells with color green (2). 2. Replace blue boundaries in the lower grid with blue and its interior cells with color orange (7). 3. Leave the cells that are not part of these two grids as they are. This transformation effectively paints the interior of the two separate grid structures with different colors while keeping everything else the same as before.\\\\n53. To make the output, you have to replace all black cells that are internal to the blue shapes with red if it\\\\\\'s inside the diamond shape and green if it\\\\\\'s inside the plus shape. The cells on the border of each shape and the cells outside the shapes should remain as they are.\\\\n54. To make the output, you have to apply certain rules within the rectangular shapes of each input grid. For the rectangle shape at the top replace all 1\\\\\\'s that are inside (not bordering any 0\\\\\\'s) with 7. For the rectangle shape at the bottom replace all 1\\\\\\'s that are inside (not bordering any 0\\\\\\'s) with 2. Keep all other parts of the grid the same.\\\\n55. To make the output, the transformation pattern involves replacing the inner part of each square (excluding the border) with another color. The top square inner part is replaced with red and the bottom square\\\\\\'s inner part is replaced with fuschia.\\\\n56. The transformation involves replacing the inside \\\\\\'0\\\\\\'s of \\\\\\'1\\\\\\' shaping the binary number with \\\\\\'7\\\\\\' and \\\\\\'2\\\\\\' respectively from the top half to the bottom half of the grid. Outside \\\\\\'0\\\\\\' and the boundary of \\\\\\'1\\\\\\' remain the same in the output as in input.\\\\n57. To make the output, you have to replace all the \\\\\\'1\\\\\\'s inside the digit \\\\\\'8\\\\\\' with the digit \\\\\\'7\\\\\\'. For the right side of the digit \\\\\\'8\\\\\\', replace all \\\\\\'1\\\\\\'s inside it with \\\\\\'2\\\\\\'. The digits outside the shape of \\\\\\'8\\\\\\' remain unchanged.\\\\n58. To get the output, replace all 0\\\\\\'s (black) inside the blue squares in the input with 7\\\\\\'s (orange), and all 0\\\\\\'s (black) inside the squares at the bottom of the grid with 2\\\\\\'s (red) in the output. The entire blue square and the blocks of 0\\\\\\'s (black) that don\\\\\\'t belong to these squares or outside should remain unchanged.\\\\n59. To make the output, you have to fill the areas inside the blue squares or rectangles. If the square/rectangle is at the top half above empty spaces, use green; if at the bottom half below empty spaces, use red.\\\\n60. To make the output, the transformation rule is to change the color of the empty spaces inside the squares but leave the borders and outside of the squares unchanged. Change the inside of the blue square from black to fuschia and the inside of the red square from black to teal.\\\\n61. To transform the input grid, you should fill out the empty blue squares within a shape, forming a solid shape. This is achieved by changing blue squares inside a shape from value 1 to value 7 if they ar non-border and surrounded by blue squares. The border is considered to be the blue squares that form the outer part of each shape. The same operation is done on the second part of the shape but filling it with value 2 instead.\\\\n62. To make the output, you have to convert all inner 1(blue) cells of both upper and lower squares to a new color. Replace the inner color of the top square with 2(red) and replace the inner color of the lower square with 7(orange) in the output grid. The position and size of the square and black cells remain unchanged.\\\\n63. To make the output, you have to replace the inner region of the upper square with 7s (oranges) and the inner region of the lower square with 2s (reds). The outer boundaries of the squares that were originally 1s, remain as 1s (blues) in the output. The separating row of 0s (blacks) remains the same.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "Category 1: Transformation based on the position of the shape on the grid\nRule: If a shape is located in the top half of the grid, fill its interior with color A, and if it's in the bottom half, fill it with color B.

To make the output, you have to generate a bigger version of the input grid where each 1x1 box in the input is represented as a 3x2 box in the output. The four 3x2 boxes in the corners are a reflection of the input, but rotated 180 degrees. The box in the middle of the grid is a mirror image of the input grid. The boxes on the sides are the same as the boxes in the input grid, but rotated 90 degrees.\\\\n2. The transformation process involves repeating the 3x2 grid three times in the vertical direction. After that, mirror each 3x2 block along the vertical axis situated in the middle of the block.\\\\n3. To make the output, you have to  enlarge the input grid three times and mirror it both horizontally and vertically.\\\\n4. To make the output, you have to repeat the entire 2x3 input grid thrice vertically. Then, mirror the entire stack to the right.\\\\n5. To make the output, you have to position the cell in question (the cell from the input grid that will be used to calculate the value of the output square), in the middle of the 9 squares in the output grid (a 3x3 square in the output grid). Then, copy the cell value from the input to the four corners of the 3x3 square in the output, and fill the remaining cells of the 3x3 square with the opposite color (if the cell in question is colored, use black; if it\\\\\\'s black, use the color of the cell in question). You repeat this pattern using each cell from the input grid in the corresponding position in the output grid. The final output grid is a scaled up (x3 on each side) version of the input.\\\\n6. To make the output, you have to repeat each row of the input three times and expand each cell of the row into two identical cells. Repeat this process three times to get the output grid. It\\\\\\'s as if you\\\\\\'re magnifying the original input grid in the vertical and horizontal direction with a magnification factor of 3 and 2 respectively.\\\\n7. To make the output, you have to repeat each cell horizontally and then repeat the rows to form a 3x3 grid. The result will form a larger version of the initial grid.\\\\n8. To make the output, you have to copy and enlarge the input grid structure by 3 times. For every cell in the input, you replicate it to the corresponding 3x3 grid in the output, with two diagonal corners sharing the same color as the input cell, and other squares are replicated from their surrounding cells. Middle 3x3 grid of the output is always filled with blacks.\\\\n9. To make the output, you have to reflect the input both horizontally and vertically three times, filling empty spots with the reflection of the color blocks on the corners of the grid.\\\\n10. To make the output, you have to reflect each row of the input grid vertically and then repeat the reflected row three times vertically. Then you repeat the whole process three times vertically on the output grid.\\\\n11. To make the output, you have to create a larger grid by repeating and reflecting the smaller grid. Repeat the input grid three times vertically and twice horizontally. Then, reflect the first and third repetition vertically and the second repetition horizontally. The reflection operation should be applied after the repetitions.\\\\n12. To make the output, you have to replicate and rotate the 3x2 grid. Take the original 3x2 grid and add it on the top left corner of the resulting grid. Then, rotate the original grid 90 degrees clockwise and put the result on the top right. Repeat this process, each time rotating the grid, until you fill the 9x4 grid.\\\\n13. To make the output, you have to take the input grid and add a copy of it on either side, then add two more rows on top of the grid that mirror the bottom. Now not only the rows, but also the columns of the expanded grid should mirror each other.\\\\n14. To make the output, you have to first create a grid by extending the input grid horizontally to a 3x4 grid. Then, repeat this grid vertically three times. You should leave the cells which were originally black in the input as black, and replicate the colored cell on exact locations where they are on the input grid.\\\\n15. To make the output, you have to mirror the grid diagonally; then mirror the result horizontally and concatenate the result. Replicate this process vertically. Finally, concatenate a mirrored version of the entire resulting grid vertically.\\\\n16. To make the output, the original 3x2 grid is used as a stamp to imprint a 9x4 grid. The imprints are produced by copying the original 3x2 grid into the 9x4 grid three times vertically and twice horizontally. In each 3x2 section of the 9x4 grid, you keep the same coloring as the original 3x2 grid.\\\\n17. To make the output, you have to create a 3x4 quadruplicate of the input grid. Take each row, multiply it by four. Then repeat the row three times. Do this for every row in the input to get the final output.\\\\n18. The output grid is a threefold replication of the input grid, both vertically and horizontally. Coloured squares become squares of 2 units and black squares become squares of 0 units. The squares are all separated by a unit of black cells.\\\\n19. To make the output, you have to first expand the rows and columns of the input grid by 3. This means that each colored cell in the input grid will now be a 3x2 grid of that color on the output grid and each black cell will become a 3x2 grid of black cells.   Next, for every 3x2 grid, reflect the entire row set to both right and left. Also, reflect the whole column set upwards and downwards.  This makes a cross shape with the same color and surrounding it with black cells. The output is a cross pattern of cells, with the color from the input cell.\\\\n20. To make the output, you have to  take the top row of the input and repeat it three times on the top of the output. Then, mirror it to the bottom of the output. Repeat the same process with the middle row of the input in the middle of the output and with the bottom row of the input at the bottom of the output. The output will be a 3x3 grid of the original rows, with each row mirrored horizontally.\\\\n21. To make the output, you have to take the 2x3 grid and repeat it three times vertically. Then, combine the three copies to make a row, and then repeat the row four times.\\\\n22. To make the output, use the pattern of the colored squares in the input. Repeat this pattern three times both horizontally and vertically, the entire 3x2 grid is replicated a total of nine times in the output (three times across and three times down). The pattern is mirrored around its center row when the pattern is repeated vertically.\\\\n23. To make the output, first, you have to replicate the original 3x2 grid three times vertically. Second, within each 3x2 grid, the individual cells are then doubled horizontally, creating a 3x4 grid from each original 3x2 grid. Note that this also expands vertically by adding one more replicate of 3x2 grid below the original replicate - which makes the total size of the final output grid 9x4.\\\\n24. To make the output, you have to quadruplicate the input grid both horizontally and vertically. This means taking the input grid and copying it three times below and one time to the right, so that there are four copies of the input grid laid out in a 2 by 2 format.\\\\n25. To make the output, you have to take the 3x2 input grid, mirror it horizontally and vertically to form a 3x4 grid. Then duplicate the whole 3x4 grid three times vertically to form a 9x4 grid.\\\\n26. To make the output, you have to expand the 3x2 grid to a 9x4 grid. The layout of the colors and black boxes is repeated three times in both rows and columns to transform the input to the output.\\\\n27. To make the output, you have to replace every colored square in the input with a 3x3 square where only the corners are colored and the rest is black. Doubling the input grid, so that the output grid consists of 3x3 identical copies of the input grid, with black squares filling in the remaining middle spaces.\\\\n28. To make the output, take the 2x2 input grid and replicate it into a 9x4 grid, basically enlarging the original pattern. Now rotate the entire grid 90 degrees to the left resulting in a 4x9 grid. This is the trickiest part: the now-empty parts of the 9x9 grid should be filled with the opposite pattern of the original 2x2 grid.\\\\n29. To make the output, you have to create a pattern by replicating the input grid three times vertically and twice horizontally in a mirror image pattern. The mirror image pattern means that if there was a color cell on the right side of the original grid, now it will be on the left side of the replicated part and vice versa.\\\\n30. To make the output, first, replicate the input structure in a two-by-two form to create a 6x4 grid. Then mirror this 6x4 grid along a horizontal axis to make a 9x4 grid. The top and bottom rows and the middle row should always be identical. It\\\\\\'s comparable to the input grid being magnified three times alongside a vertical mirror in the center.\\\\n31. To make the output, you have to create a grid three times the size of the input both horizontally and vertically. Each quadrant of the output grid should replicate the content of the input matrix.\\\\n32. To make the output, first replicate the input grid three times vertically. Then, for each Non-black number, place a similar number in the corresponding positions of the 3x3 sub-grids to the diagonal. More specifically, the Non-black number in each cell of the input grid should be placed in the opposing corners of a 3x3 block in the output grid.\\\\n33. To make the output, you need to replicate the input matrix three times vertically and twice horizontally. You will be extending each row and column of the input grid into a row and column in the output grid that is three times longer.\\\\n34. To make the output, you will have to multiply the input by 3 vertically and by 2 horizontally. The two newly added rows should be a copy of the row just above them ending with an additional copy of the first row, while the newly added columns should just be a direct copy of the column beside them.\\\\n35. To make the output, you have to upscale the grid content. Every value in the input grid gets replicated as a 3x2 block in the output. This pattern is repeated for every value in the input grid including the black cells. Each original cell (whether colored or black) corresponds to a square of 3x2 in the output grid with same value.\\\\n36. The transformation expands the graph three times in the vertical direction and two times in the horizontal direction. Each unit of the original 3x2 input grid is replaced by a 3x2 segment in the expanded grid. This segment maintains the original unit\\\\\\'s color on the top right and bottom left corners, whereas the rest of the entries are filled with the color of the opposite corresponding corner in the original unit. If the original unit is completely black, the corresponding segment in the expanded grid is also completely black.\\\\n37. To make the output, you have to magnify the whole grid by three times. Each box from the input corresponds to a 3x3 square in the output where the color of the diagonal boxes is the color of the original box, the box on other diagonal (the one starting from the upper right corner) is the color of the box below the original box. Other boxes are black. If the original box is the last one in the column, then the color of the box on other diagonal is the color of the original box itself.\\\\n38. To make the output, you have to take each row in the input grid and repeat it three times in the output. After that, take each column and duplicate it once to the right. Essentially, you have to upscale the original 3x2 grid to a 9x4 grid by repeating rows thrice and duplicating columns once.\\\\n39. To make the output, you should create three stacked copies of the input grid. Then, within each copy, replicate each row three times. After that, swap the cells\\\\\\' contents diagonally across the 3x3 blocks. To clarify, cells at the positions (r,c), (r+1,c+1), and (r+2,c+2) for each of these blocks should have their contents replaced by what was originally at cell (r+2,c), (r+1,c+1), and (r,c+2) respectively.\\\\n40. To make the output, you have to replicate the input grid three times vertically and twice horizontally. Each cell in the input translates to a 3x2 grid in the output. The placement of the colors in the cells of the output grid 3x2 cells is given by a diagonal from top left corner to bottom right corner in the output 3x2 grid. If the corresponding input cell is black, all the cells are black in the output 3x2 grid. If the input cell is colored, then all cells except for the diagonal from top left corner to bottom right corner in the output 3x2 grid are colored.\\\\n41. To generate the output, multiply each cell of the input grid by three in the vertical axis and by two in the horizontal axis, replicating the value of that particular cell. Therefore, one cell from the input grid will turn into three cells in the vertical axis and two cells in the horizontal axis in the output.\\\\n42. To make the output, you need to expand and repeat each cell in the following way. The cell at the top left needs to be expanded into a 3x2 block at the top right corner of the output. The cell at the top right needs to be expanded into a 3x2 block at the top left corner of the output. The cell at the middle left needs to be expanded into two 3x2 blocks in the middle of the output. The cell at the middle right needs to be expanded into two 3x2 blocks in between the middle and the top blocks in the output. The cell at the bottom left needs to be expanded into a 3x2 block at the bottom right of the output. The cell at the bottom right needs to be expanded into a 3x2 block at the bottom left of the output.\\\\n43. The 3x2 grid is repeated by mirroring or reflecting the grid in the vertical and horizontal axes both before and after the 3x2 grid. The original 3x2 grid retains its orientation in the top left and bottom right corners of the output, it is mirrored vertically in the top right and bottom left corners and it is mirrored horisontally in the 2nd and 4th rows. In other words, the transformation takes the 3x2 input grid, duplicates it 9 times to fill the new 9x4 grid. For each row of 3 in the new grid, the first 3x2 grid is mirrored horizontally for the second copy and the third copy is the same as the first. This pattern is repeated every 3 rows.\\\\n44. Imagine the input grid magnified so that each cell in the input grid becomes a 3x2 block in the output grid. To make the output, you have to replicate/mirror this magnified grid in both vertical and horizontal dimensions. This mirror reflection will take place along the central row and the central column. The reflection should be performed so that the colors stay side-by-side in the larger scale i.e., if there is a color in the top-right part of the original grid, it should appear in the top right and bottom left of the output.\\\\n45. To make the output, you have to take each cell from the input and create an enlarged version of it like a checkerboard pattern. In the enlarged version, the cell itself becomes a 3x3 square where one corner is the color of the original cell and the other cells are black. The corners of the larger square alternate black and the original cell color. This pattern repeats three times vertically.\\\\n46. To make the output, duplicate each cell in the input (both colored and black cells) three times in a square (3 cells by 3 cells). The order of these boxes should be the same as the order in which the cells appear in the input grid. Repeat this for each cell throughout the grid.\\\\n47. To create the output, you need to expand the input grid by repeating each row three times and each column twice to the output grid ensuring that the input\\\\\\'s 3 sections (each being 1 row) are copied and repeated in a consecutive manner. The entire input structure is basically copied three times vertically and the cells in each row are also repeated once horizontally in the output grid.\\\\n48. To make the output, you have to create four extended copies of each cell of the input grid, two of these copies flipped 180 degrees diagonally. The input grid should be extended in a way that the colors are displayed in form of an \"X\" on the output grid.\\\\n49. The output is a 3x3 repetition of the input grid with each 2x2 pixel block from the input replaced by a similar mirrored 3 times in a 3x4 matrix.\\\\n50. To make the output, take each 2x1 block in the input and replicate it into a 4x4 block in the output, where the diagonal corresponds to the input block with the rest being the mirror image of that. Repeat this operation three times, placing each 4x4 block in the output below the preceding one. The colors remain the same as in the input.\\\\n51. To make the output, you have to first triple the size of each cell in both the rows and columns of the grid. The 9x4 grid then is to be filled by stretching the 3x2 grid like an elastic material, with the original colors kept in their relative positions, but each is stretched to fill a 3x2 area.\\\\n52. To transform the grid accurately, each input color square in the column should be expanded to a 3x3 matrix where the color square is in the center and the other 8 squares are black. These 3x3 patterns are stacked on each other to form the output grid.\\\\n53. To achieve the output, the transformation initiates by reflecting each row horizontally and then appending it to the original row. After this operation, the resulting rows are reflected vertically and appended to the original set of rows. The process is repeated one more time, with the new set of rows reflecting and appending to form the correct output.\\\\n54. To make the output, you have to copy and enlarge each input box\\\\\\'s color. That is, for every 1 box in the input, you generate an equivalent 3x2 block in the output, carrying the color along. The enlarged boxes are placed in a 3-row 3-column matrix form to fill the 9x4 grid.\\\\n55. To make the output, replicate the input grid three times in vertical direction to create a 9x2 grid i.e., a column-wise repetition of 3 times. Then, for each row in this grid, copy the contents of first and second cell into third and fourth cell respectively but only if the content is not black; if the content is black, copy the content of the other cell.\\\\n56. To make the output, you have to enlarge each cell into a 3x2 grid with 1 column copy on the right. Entire grid is then reflected across a vertical line to form a 9x4 grid. Repeat this until the output grid is 9 rows and 4 columns.\\\\n57. To make the output, you have to upscale the 2x2 grid to 3x3 squares. Each grid is copied into a larger 3x3 version of itself, where the original 2x2 grid is replicated to the outside borders and the center remains free. Each cell in 2x2 grid is untransformed in its corresponding 3x3 grid.\\\\n58. To create the output grid, each cell in the input is replaced with a 3x3 square. The color of the top right and bottom left cell in each 3x3 square matches the color of the input cell, while the center cell in each 3x3 square matches the color of the cell diagonally below and to the right in the input. All other cells in each 3x3 square are black.\\\\n59. To make the output, split each cell from the input grid into four equal smaller cells in the output grid. Then mirror the smaller cells vertically and horizontally within their original cell. This results in a pattern where the original input cell is repeated four times in a 2x2 pattern in the output grid. Each 2x2 block is a symmetrical reflection of its neighboring blocks.\\\\n60. To make the output, you need to scale up the input grid. The output grid is the input grid with each cell replaced by a 3x2 grid, as follows: the central cell is the same color as the one cell in the input grid, whereas the others are the mirror image along vertical and horizontal lines.\\\\n61. To create the output, the 3x2 input grid should be repeated to form a 3x3 configuration of the input grid, thereby scaling the grid size up. Each cell of the 3x2 input grid should also be replaced by a 3x2 grid of the same configuration, thus amplifying each cell into a 3x2 configuration of itself. This causes the total size of the grid to expand to 9x6.\\\\n62. To make the output, you have to scale up and extend the input grid. Each cell in the input will be represented by a 3x2 block in the output.The color pattern inside each 3x2 block should mirror the whole 3x2 input. This pattern should be repeated vertically three times.\\\\n63. To make the output, you use the input 3x2 colors grid and first replicate those rows in the output grid 3 times (each row of input showing in the output 3 times). The replication happens vertically (row by row). Then, you duplicate the entirety of the grid, and append it horizontally to the right. In essence, the input grid is multiple times scaled both horizontally and vertically.

The transformation requires flipping the left set of colored squares horizontally to fill in the first section of black squares. Then, cycle the colors down one row at a time to fill in the final section of black squares. Fill remaining black squares with the color directly above them in the same column.\\\\n2. To make the output, you have to convert the blank (0\\\\\\'s) spaces on the grid. For each color space, we will replace it with color from the first four columns (represented by numbers) of the matching row on a column by column basis. The process chain continues until the fifth column (which is number 5). After that, we will continue take colors from the first four columns in reverse order for the remaining columns, excluding the columns containing number 5.\\\\n3. To make the output, you need to rotate the first three colored boxes to the right and place those colors into the blocks of black squares. The first color goes into the last block, the second color goes into the first through second last blocks, and the last color goes into the rest of the blocks. The gray boxes stay in place. The process is then repeated for each of the three rows.\\\\n4. To make the output, you have to reflect the first four colored cells across the grey cell to replace the black cells after the grey cell. Furthermore, the color of the last cell of the output grid should be the color of the first cell of the input grid, and least two neighboring cells in the last three cells of the output grid should have the same color, which is the color of the second cell in the input grid.\\\\n5. To create the output grid, you have to use a combination of the colors from the first segment and their reversed sequence from the third segment. The first four columns replicate the colors of the first segment columns. The next 3 columns contains the color shift upwards with the cell in top rows borrowed to the bottom rows. The second grey cell (in the eighth column) is similar to the input grid. The last three columns have reversed sequence for each color from the first segment downwards.\\\\n6. Start by bisecting the input grid, splitting 4x3 box and the gap. The first four columns on each row need to be mirrored into the gap on the same row. Specifically, it mirrors whatever pattern is there, but in reverse order (right-to-left instead of left-to-right). Then, beginning from the mirrored portion and continuing until the end of the row, reverse this entire section. This involves all of the original boxes, and the whole mirrored portion.\\\\n7. To make the output, you have to mirror the numbers on the left side of the sequence of black cells to the right side of the same sequence and vice-versa. The numbers exchange their positions with the corresponding numbers in the same row on the other side of the sequence of black cells.\\\\n8. To create the output, you need to mirror the first four number blocks into the last four black blocks after the mid-color-block, in the same order. For the last block, use the color block that is behind the mid-color-block of the next input column, if there is no next input column use the first number block from the input. Fill the three black blocks before the mid-color-block with the color block that is behind the mid-color-block from the input. For the mid-color-block, use the same from input. This transformation should be applied row by row.\\\\n9. To make the output, you have to mirror the left side of the gray color onto the right side of the gray color, but the mirroring is not straightforward copying, instead it is copied row by row in reverse order. Example, if you have a row on the left side as [2 7 8], then the mirrored output on the right side in the same row will be [8 7 2] and not [2 7 8].\\\\n10. To transform the input into the output, first, copy the 1st to 4th columns to 5th to 8th columns, then mirror the 1st to 3rd rows to 9th to 11th columns - just make sure that each color after the 1st color is not mirrored, and then finally, the 4th and 8th columns which are grey should remain the same.\\\\n11. To make the output, the transformation involves mirroring the colors from the three cells on the left over the center cell (fifth cell, color 5) to the three right cells of the central color in the left. The result is a grid that is symmetrical around the center (fifth cell).\\\\n12. To make the output, you have to follow this rule: mirror the left 3x4 portion of the grid (invert it => rightmost becomes leftmost) and put it in the place of the middle 3x3 black grid, then mirror the whole 3x11 grid again (invert it => rightmost becomes leftmost).\\\\n13. The transformation rule involves mirroring the first four cells on the left side across the middle of the grid, omitting the black cells in the process. The colors of the cells on the left side remain the same, but the positions are reversed from top to bottom. The middle of the grid, enclosed by two single cells, remains unchanged. The last three cells on the right side mirror the colors and positions of first three cells on the left side, reversing from top to bottom.\\\\n14. To make the output, you have to mirror the pattern from the first three sections to be on the other side of the grey part. The first row of the mirror image should start from the bottom color cell of the third column, then the bottom color cell from the second column and is followed by the bottom color cell of the first column. The same pattern continues on the second and third rows with the choice of color cells changing accordingly. The grey cells remain in the same position as the input grid.\\\\n15. To make the output, you have to copy the colors of the left part and paste them into the corresponding cells in the middle section. Then, rotate the colors in the left part from left to right and paste them into the right part.\\\\n16. To make the output, mirror the first three columns and place this mirrored copy in the middle of the grid. This means the bottom cell of the first column is now at the top of the fifth column, the middle cell remains in the middle, and the top cell of the first column is now at the bottom of the fifth column. Do the same for the second and third columns. Then, fill in the final four columns with a descending order of the colors from the current first three columns (from top to bottom). The color at the top of the first column is placed at the bottom of the last column, the middle color is placed in the middle, and the bottom color is placed at the top.\\\\n17. To make the output, you have to perform a mirror transformation about the central vertical line. This means that the values on the left side of the central column (not including the central column) are reflected on the right side, and the values on the right side of the central column are reflected on the left side. The colors in the central column remain the same.\\\\n18. To obtain the output from the input, once you have the input grid, follow the below steps:  1. Copy the left subgrid (found by dividing the input grid vertically into 3rds) and paste it on the right side after the grey column. It should replace all the first set of zero (black cells). 2. Copy the right subgrid (found by dividing the input grid vertically into 3rds) and flip it across the vertical axis. Now, paste this flipped part on the left side after the grey column. It should replace all the second set of zero (black cells).   NOTE: \"Flipping\" a subgrid across the vertical axis refers to the process of flipping it like a mirror image. For instance, if the right subgrid was [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]], after flipping, it becomes [[3,2,1],[6,5,4]].\\\\n19. To make the output, you have to .reflect the three color blocks on the left side of the first grey block around the black blocks. The reflection should include same sequence of colors but in reverse order, on the other side of the second grey block. Repeat this method on each horizontal strip.\\\\n20. To make the output, you have to reflect the first four colored numbers on the left side over the central fifth number (from left to right), replacing the three final black numbers. This is repeated for all three rows.\\\\n21. To make the output, you have to mirror the colors from first 4 columns (from left to right) and copy to the last 4 columns (from right to left) on the same row. Likewise, mirror the colors from last 4 columns and copy to the first 4 columns on the same row. Do this for each row. The two lines of color 5 cells remains unchanged.\\\\n22. To make the output, you have to mirror the non-black portion of each row to the right of the central column consisting of the number 5. Thus, the grid is mirrored from left to right by preserving the row order. The center column (consisting of the number 5) remains unchanged in the output.\\\\n23. To transform the input grid to output grid, you reflect the first five columns of the left half of the grid to the right half of the output grid. This will include flipping the middle column just like a mirror reflection. This applies to each rows.\\\\n24. To make the output, you have to mirror the colored cells in the first four columns to the last four columns of each row. Do the same for the colored cells in the latter half. This means columns 5,6,7 are mirrors of columns of 8,9,10 respectively and columns 8,9,10 again mirror the colors in 1,2,3 respectively for each row excluding the black cells i.e. filled cells are mirrored to filled cells only. The color in middle cell remains same.\\\\n25. To make the output, you have to copy the first three colored cells after the initial color-switching cell (cell 4). Then, the last cell of the row after the switching cell should be a copy of the third cell of the row. Subsequently, take the values from the left and right of the grid and mirror them on the opposite side essentially flipping symmetrically the first 4 columns and pasting them after the first switching cell.\\\\n26. To make the output, you have to reflect the colored portion of the grid across the middle black columns, preserving the positions of the cells but inversing their order from left to right (like a mirror image). The first and last row should also swap places.\\\\n27. To make the output, you have to replicate the right side three-cell pattern into the black cells in the center. After that, replace the left two cells after the 5 in the central section with the first two cells from the left part of the input. Then, the rightmost cell of the central section is replaced by the leftmost cell of the right part of the input. Next, replace the right side three-cell pattern with the right side three-cell pattern from the input turned upside down (mirrored vertically).\\\\n28. To make the output, you have to take the colors from columns 1-4 in each row and insert them reversed into columns 5-8. Then, place the color from column 3 in column 9, take the color from column 2 and place it in column 10, and finally take the color from column 1 and place it in column 11. All of these movements are done per row.\\\\n29. To make the output, you have to reflect or mirror the image over the central (grey) column. The fourth column from the left becomes the fourth column from the right, the third column from the left becomes the third column from the right etc. However, the central (grey) column stays the same.\\\\n30. To make the output, you have to reverse each set of three colored cells before the grey cell. Each row should remain the same from the grey cell onwards.\\\\n31. To make the output, you have to transposition the first four colors on each side of the black line with the first four on the opposite side symmetrically. If there\\\\\\'s any empty (black) cells remain, just keep them empty.\\\\n32. To make the output, you have to reflect the first four columns across the black columns and repeat at column 8.This is done row by row. The colors are mirrored such that they appear in reverse order on the other side, while maintaining original orientation from top to bottom.\\\\n33. To make the output, you have to take the 3x3 square from the middle of the grid and rotate it 180 degrees, replacing the region starting at the 5th row from the left. Then, take the 3x3 square from the start of the grid and rotate it 180 degrees, and place this in the far right 3 columns of the grid.\\\\n34. To make the output, copy the first three cells of each row and place them in the set of black cells after the first yellow cell in their respective row. The sequence should be reversed. The fourth cell should be copied into all the black cells after the second yellow cell. The order of these cells is the reverse of the input order on the same column.\\\\n35. To make the output, mirror the three columns to the left of the first grey box across the vertical line formed by the first grey box. Ignore the black boxes and fill the mirrored cells to the right of the grey box with the colors from the mirrored cells. In case the mirrored cells cross two grey boxes, fill the cells next to those with the mirrored colors likewise.\\\\n36. To make the output, you have to mirror the first half of the grid (including the first yellow cell) on the second half of the grid (starting from the second yellow cell) then copy over the first half of the grid onto the first half of the output. For example, if you have two blue cells then a red cell in the first half of the input, your output should have two blue cells then a red cell in the second half of the output. But if you have two black cells then a red cell in the second half of the output, make that two black cells then a red cell in the first half of the output.\\\\n37. To make the output, you have to mirror horizontally the series of numbers before the 5s in the same row and replace the zeros after the second 5 in each row. After that, the process should be the following: - First row: replace the mirrored series with the original series in this row. - Second row: replace the mirrored series with the original series in the first row. - Third row: replace the mirrored series with the original series in the second row.\\\\n38. To formulate the output, the transformation process involves reflecting the colored cells on the left side of the grey cell to the right side. Additionally, the rightmost colored column is duplicated to fill the last three black cells on the right. Thus, each row retains the grey cells in the same position but is surrounded by reflected colored cells and a rightmost column consisting of the same color.\\\\n39. To make the output, you have to copy the three columns on the left (as such) to the middle three columns where there are only blank spaces in the input. Then you have to rotate the initial three columns to the right about their central line, swapping the rows to achieve this. The 5 in the fourth and eighth column stays in place, and the last three columns remain black without any modifications.\\\\n40. To make the output, you have to mirror the color gradient over the first column filled with color 5, then mirror the result over the second column filled with color 5. Effectively take the colors from the left 3 columns (before the color 5 column), and mirror them to the right of the color 5 column, then take the resulting left 7 columns and mirror them to the right of the second color 5 column.\\\\n41. To get the output, first divide the input grid into three sections: the first four columns, the middle three columns filled with black and the last four columns. Copy the first 4 columns and place them directly into last four columns of the output in reverse order. Finally copy the middle three columns as it is. Keep the other cells as black cells. Also, it seems like the last number of the first sequence is replaced by the last number of the second sequence (Corners of the initial numbers are swapped) in the output grid.\\\\n42. To make the output, imagine the colorful shape as being mirrored about the vertical axis going through the center of the grid. Keep the grey line and the zeros as they are.\\\\n43. To make the output, you have to take the left side of the input grid (before the black cells) and mirror it to the right side of the grey cell in the same row. So, the colors of the cells from the left will be repeated to the right side beginning from rightmost cell backwards. This transformation rule works first by mirroring the initial colors over the centermost cell (grey) and then replacing the black cells in the right half with this mirrored pattern.\\\\n44. To make the output, you have to replicate the three coulumns of colors from the far left in the exact order in the three columns to the right of the middle. Then, fill the rest of the grid on the right side with the same colors as the columns on the left but in reverse order from bottom to top.\\\\n45. To make the output, you have to mirror the colored squares in the first half of the row to the second half of the row and repeat it. Keep the original colors on the middle line. If the begin square on the right half is not black, replace the corresponding cell on the second half with the color of the begin square on the right half.\\\\n46. To make the output, you have to rotate the entire grid 180 degrees, i.e., reflect it over its center. This will place the 3x3 square on the right side of the grid, the 3x1 column of 5s at the center and move the empty 3x3 square to the left.   However, there is a special rule that applies to this reflection. In the 3x3 square, the reflected matrix should use the following rotation rule. The upper left cell goes to the lower right, the upper center goes to the center right, the upper right goes to the upper right, the middle left goes to the lower center, the center stays the same, the middle right goes to the upper center, the lower left goes to the lower left, the lower middle goes to the middle left, and the lower right goes to the upper left. Once the reflection is complete, the 3x\\\\n47. To make the output, you have to mirror the first four colored cells, replacing the black cells following the grey cell in each row. The black cells in the initial input get replaced with the same sequence of colored cells, but in reverse order from left to right. The grey cell in the middle of each row remains the same.\\\\n48. To transform a grid flip the first four columns and place it in the places of the last four columns and then mirror image it along the central column to fill the places of the first four columns. Every fourth number in the row must be 5 as the original input. Keep the rest of the pattern the same.   To be more precise, split the 11x3 input grid into an 4x3 grid on the either side of the center column. Then mirror flip the 4x3 grid on both sides around the center column which is filled with 5s.\\\\n49. To make the output, you mirror the left side of each row (excluding the grey box) after the black space following the first grey box. After the second black space, the colors are a mirror image of the first 3 colored squares on the left of the row starting from the right to the left direction.\\\\n50. In transforming the input grid into the output grid, the color in the first 4 columns is taken, and this same color sequence is then mirrored to the last 4 columns on the right. It\\\\\\'s as if the grid is reflected from left-to-right, same colors flip to other side with respect to the center line located after 5th column.   One difference is that, in the case where the 3rd column from the left has a unique color (not repeated in first two columns), this color then becomes the color of the last 3 squares in the grid for that respective row.\\\\n51. To make the output, you have to mirror the first four columns of the initial input matrix (including the column of 5\\\\\\'s) and place them in the last four columns of the grid. The mirrored section should exclude black cells. The rest of the grid remains the same as the input grid.\\\\n52. The transformation is about mirroring the colors of the cells from left to right and inversely. To make the output, you should copy the first four colored squares and place them in mirror order after the fifth square. Then go back to the original pattern and copy the fifth square followed by the fourth square and place them after the copied pattern. Finally, copy each 1st, 2nd, and 3rd squares of the original pattern in mirror order and place them at the end to complete the transformation. Repeat the same process for each row.\\\\n53. To create the output, you should copy the vertical colored section from the left side and paste it reversed (from bottom to top) in the right black empty space. Then, repeat this process but this time take the vertical colored section from the right side and paste it in the left black empty space. After pasting, relate the elements of the leftmost column of the left copied section to the corresponding elements in the original middle colored column, from bottom to top (the second color in the original column relates to the first in the pasted column, the third to the second, and so forth). Repeat this process for the right pasted section but relating the elements of its rightmost column to those in the original middle column, from top to bottom (the first color in the original column relates to the first in the pasted column, the second to the second, and so forth).\\\\n54. The transformation follows these steps: Imagine that the numbers in the color strips between the grey lines are reflecting/mirroring vertically from left side into the black area on the right side after the second grey line. Just remember numbers are reflected not colors. The portion of black and grey remains the same in the output.\\\\n55. To make the output, you rotate the left square section 180 degrees along the center axis and then reflect it. The column of color on the right side of the grid is copied from the right-most column of the rotated square.\\\\n56. To make the output, you need to reflect each row of digits (ignoring zeros), from left to right across the middle of the row. Zero remains at the same place in every row i.e., after and before 5. The numbers from begin to 5 get mirrored around 5 and place after it. The same numbers but in reversed order are placed after the last 5 in each row.\\\\n57. The transformation pattern flips the colors and numbers in the first section of each row over the grey line and fills the last section of the same row, in such a way that it becomes a mirror image of the first section. There\\\\\\'s also rotation of colors towards the right in the last section - each color rotates to the next spot in a clockwise direction.\\\\n58. To make the output, you have to perform a two-step operation. First, mirror the left 3x4 part of the grid undertaking a left-right reflection along the vertical center of the grid, replacing the black cells in the middle with the mirrored pattern. Second, take the first column from the left half of the grid and replace the last column of the grid on the right side.\\\\n59. To make the output, you have to mirror-reflect the colored boxes on the left side of the grid over to the right side across the column, replacing the black cells with the corresponding mirror colors. The rightmost colored values on each line reflect into the 5th to 7th column from the left side followed by the remaining on both ends resulting in a bilateral symmetry of colors across the column.\\\\n60. To make the output, central symmetry is applied to the non-zero part of the input using the \\\\\\'5\\\\\\' as the center. This is done on each row. The numbers preceding \\\\\\'5\\\\\\' appear in reversed order after \\\\\\'5\\\\\\' and vice versa. And, the zeros remained at their original place.\\\\n61. The transformation rules seem to divide the grid horizontally into two halves. On the left side (first half), each row is populated with 4 color blocks followed by 4 black blocks while on the right side (second half), the first 4 columns are populated with color blocks which are a mirrored version of the color blocks found in the corresponding position on the left side. The remaining 3 columns in the right are filled in with black blocks which are also mirrored versions of the black blocks in the corresponding position on the left.\\\\n62. To make the output, you have to rotate each sequence of 4 colored cells, surrounded by the black cells, 180 degrees around its center. This means flipping the order of the colors in each sequence and placing them in the original cells in the right of the black cells.\\\\n63. To make the output, you have to replace the black cells on the right half of the grid by mirroring the non-black cells of the left half in reverse order. The column with number \\\\\\'5\\\\\\' in the middle remains the same.\\\\n64. To make the output, first ignore the rows that only consist of 5\\\\\\'s and 0\\\\\\'s. Then, reflect the remaining part of each row about a vertical axis centered in the grid. Then reinsert the rows of 5\\\\\\'s and 0\\\\\\'s where they were in the input.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "After analyzing the rules, they can be categorized into eight distinct categories based on their similarities:\n\nCategory 1: Mirroring/Reflecting Rules (Rules: 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, 14, 17, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 29, 31, 32, 35, 38, 40, 42, 43, 45, 47, 48, 49, 51, 53, 54, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 63, 64)\nSynthesized Rule: To make the output, mirror the colored cells on one side of the grid across a central point or line, replacing the corresponding cells on the other side.

For each category, synthesize the rules into a single, specific rule that combines the ideas of all rules in that category, while clearly differentiating it from the other categories.\\\\nThe new rule should be as specific as possible, following the format of the given rules.\\\\nThe new rule should be applicable without any information from the original rules - i.e. it should be standalone.\\\\n\\\\nRules:\\\\n1. To make the output, you have to remove all colors except for the row that includes all teal numbers. Replace the remaining cells with black. The row of teal numbers is kept intact and placed in the output with all other numbers replaced with black.\\\\n2. To make the output, you have to find the largest continuous block of the same color. In the output grid, replace all cells in that block with that color, and replace all other cells with black.\\\\n3. To make the output, observe the input grid and find areas where the green cells form a vertical streak of width one cell. Copy this pattern to the output grid maintaining its position and size. The rest of the output grid should be black.\\\\n4. To make the output, you have to look for a contiguous block of 7s in the input and replicate that block at the same position in the output grid. All other numbers in the grid should be turned into 0s.\\\\n5. To make the output: keep only the rows where the majority of blocks (more than half) are of the same color (not including the black cells). All other rows should be made black.\\\\n6. To make the output, you have to scan the input grid. If you see a horizontal line of constant non-zero numbers and its length is more than 3. Then copy it to the output at the same location, else follow the input. Make everything else 0.\\\\n7. To make the output, the pattern is identifying a largest rectangle made up of 7s, and copying that shape over to the output, with the rest areas filled with 0s (black). If there are many largest rectangles, select the one nearest to the top. If there are multiple largest rectangles at the same top, select the one nearest to the left.\\\\n8. To make the output, you have to find a 1x3 horizontal bar in the grid. Copy that horizontal bar and paste it in the same place in the output grid. All the other cells in the output grid should be 0.\\\\n9. To make the output, you need to replace all colors with black color, except the green line (represented by the number 7). If the green line exists in the input grid, the line should be retained in the same position in the output grid.\\\\n10. To transform the grid, locate the largest square with the same number on 3 (or more) sides (i.e., top, bottom, left or right). If such square is found, retain it in the output and replace the rest of the grid cells with black color. If no such square found, output all-black grid.\\\\n11. To make the output, you have to focus on the largest contiguous block of any single number in the grid. All the rest of the numbers in the grid are replaced with zero while this largest block remains untouched. If there is another block of numbers with an equal size, only one block is kept in the output. For example, if the grid contains a block of seven \\'2\\'s and a block of seven \\'3\\'s, only one of these blocks will be present in the output, all the other numbers including the other block of seven, are replaced with zeros.\\\\n12. To make the output, you have to look for a sequence of repeated numbers in a horizontal line. If a sequence of seven or more repeated numbers is found, keep it and convert everything else to black squares.\\\\n13. To make the output, all you have to do is to retain the block of pink cells (represented by number \\'7\\') if it\\'s a 3x3 block, and make everything else black cell (represented by number \\'0\\'). If there is no 3x3 block of pink cells in the input, the output grid will be completely black.\\\\n14. To make the output from the input, first locate the longest consecutive row of same non-zero numbers in the grid. The output grid will then be the same size as the input grid, replacing all other numbers with 0 (black) and preserving only the row of greatest length from the input grid where the numbers were the same and non-zero. If such row does not exist, the output grid will be filled with zero.\\\\n15. To make the output, you have to filter out any block that is not placed between two blocks of the same color from top and bottom. In simpler words, retain only those color blocks which have same colored blocks directly above and below them, while the rest of the grid becomes black.\\\\n16. From the input, you have to extract a specific central pattern. Specifically, you need to locate a square of 7\\'s (representing a sequence of gray cells) that is surrounded by black cells. This square could be of varying sizes, but is always located somewhere in the middle of the grid. Everything else should be turned into black cells in the output.\\\\n17. To make the output, you have to locate the largest square in the grid that is filled with the same number that is not zero (in this case it is 7), leave it intact, and transform all other numbers in the grid to zero.\\\\n18. To create the output, identify the largest contiguous area of a color that is not black, and keep just that in the output grid, changing everything else to black. For example, in all the given test cases, the largest contiguous color area is the ones made of \\'7\\', and only they are retained while everything else is turned into black. The position and size of the \\'7\\' squares are maintained as in the input grid in the output grid.\\\\n19. To make the output, locate cells in the input grid where the value, represented by color, is 7. These cells should be carried over to the new grid. Other cells should be set to black (represented by 0). This transformation is essentially isolating all cells of a specific color (in this case color 7) and coloring all others black.\\\\n20. To make the output, you need to focus on blocks of contiguous same-colored cells in the shape of a rectangle within the input grid. These blocks are preserved in the output. Everything else in the grid, including isolated colored cells and black cells, should turn to 0 (black) in the output.\\\\n21. To make the output, you should identify the collection of vertically adjacent squares of the same color in the input. Particularly, there should be a collection of three or more green square cells aligned vertically and there should be no colored cells on left and right sides of the green cells. If identified, carry those over to the black output grid (in the same place). All other cells should be black in output grid.\\\\n22. To make the output, you have to remove all numbers from the grid, except for the continuous line of number 7. So, the transformation fills almost all boxes with the number 0, except boxes which appeared with the continuous line of number 7 in the input.\\\\n23. To make the output, you have to scan through the input grid and keep the first contiguous vertically or horizontally aligned sequence of the same non-black cell (color is represented by number 7) and turn all the rest of the cells into black.\\\\n24. To make the output, you have to find the section in the input where there are block of sevens surrounded entirely by zeros. This box of sevens appears to stay intact in the transition from the input grid to the output grid. Everything else in the grid becomes a zero.\\\\n25. To achieve the output, the grid should be swept to identify the repeated horizontal sequence of a specific number other than zero, which is three by one cells in size. For these case studies, the number was 7 and the repeated sequence was in rows 3, 4 and 5. All other numbers are turned into 0 (black).\\\\n26. To obtain the output, look at the input, if you find a continuous longest horizontal line composed of a single color, maintain this in the output. This line should be more than two cells long. Turn all other cells black.\\\\n27. To make the output, you have to look for a recurring pattern in the input. There are three consecutive rows filled entirely with the color orange. The transformation rule here is to keep these three rows filled with orange in the output while every other cell in the grid should be changed to black. Thus, only the orange rows are kept, everything else is turned black.\\\\n28. To make the output, look at the third row from the top (row 3) down to the fifth row from the bottom (row 5), inclusive. Preserve these rows, while making the rest of the grid black. On the rows you just preserved, only maintain the block of cells with color 7, and turn all the other cells on these rows black as well.  Note: The transformation hinges on preserving only very specific rows, and within those rows only preserving cells with a specific color (7 in this case). This pattern extraction problem is based on specification with nested conditions.\\\\n29. To make the output, you have to look for columns of identical non-black numbers in the input grid. If such a column exists, retain it in the output. If not, make the entire column black (0).\\\\n30. To make the output, you have to find the 3x3 square in the input that is filled with the same non-black color (all numbers are same and not 0). Copy this 3x3 square to the output at the same position. All the rest of the output grid should be black (0).\\\\n31. To make the output, you have to locate any 1x3 horizontal set of boxes filled with green (represented by number 7) in the input grid, and those boxes should be the only colored boxes in the output grid. All other boxes should be black.\\\\n32. To make the output, you have to find a 3x3 sub-grid within the input grid where the 3x3 sub-grid is a homogenous area of the number 7. Preserve the 3x3 area in the output, and make all other parts of the grid black.\\\\n33. To make the output, find the largest square (or squares) of the same color that has no black in it and is surrounded by black. This square should reside in the third quadrant (bottom-left) of the input. Keep this square in the output and change all other cells to black.\\\\n34. To make the output, you should located the sequence of red color(from 2 in the input grid), composed by three contiguous cells on the same row. This sequence represents the exact position on the output grid but with a black color (0 on the grid). All other cells should be made black too.\\\\n35. To make the output, you have to look for the rectangle of repeating numbers in the input. This rectangle is then transferred to the output, while all other cells are turned to black.\\\\n36. To make the output, you have to look for a sequence of at least three consecutive squares with the same non-zero number in the grid (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). Leave these as they are. If there are less than three squares with the same number or with zero as the number, change them to zero. This preserves lines of at least three of the same number and gets rid of anything else.\\\\n37. To make the output, you have to find the largest rectangular block of the same pixel color in the input. Then, remove all other color data from the picture. If there are equal sized largest blocks, select the one closer to the top left.\\\\n38. To make the output, you have to only keep the 3x3 square of green squares in the input and make everything else black. The position of the 3x3 green square remains same in the output as it was in the input grid.\\\\n39. To make the output, you have to keep only the rows that consist of similar consecutive colored cells (except the black cells) ignoring any black cells at the sides, and all other rows turn into full black cells. In other words, the transformation finds horizontal stripes of consecutive non-black cells of the same color flanked by black cells and discards everything else turning them entirely black.\\\\n40. To make the output, first, locate the square of the color 7 on the large input grid. This square of the color 7 can be different sizes, but it is always rectangular or square. Then, convert all cells not part of this square to black. The squares within this 7-colored square should retain their colors as in the input.\\\\n41. To make the output, you need to look for a group of consecutively colored cells that form a perfect horizontal line, and keep only these cells. All other cells should be turned black. In other words, we need to identify a line that completely fills the row horizontally and from the third row to the fifth one. All other colored cells are turned into black cells.\\\\n42. To make the output, the transformation pattern is to clear all areas on the grid except any 3 consecutive rows that are full of the same number. Retain this patch of three rows with the same number on the output grid. This patch of three rows is horizontally centered in the grid. In the presented samples, the patch is filled with number 7, but it could be any number. The rest of the grid is left blank (filled with 0s).\\\\n43. To get our output from the input we need to carry out certain transformations. The rule for transformation is that any cell that has teal colored cells on their both horizontal sides as well as vertical sides is turned into a teal cell and everything else is turned black. Hence, we\\'re left largely with a black grid with a row of teal blocks in the middle when this rule is applied to the input grid.\\\\n44. To make the output, you have to clear all squares, except for the brown horizontal line in the middle. The horizontal line of brown squares in the output should be in the same position as it was in the input grid.\\\\n45. To make the output, you have to find 4 turquoise number-7 cells that form a 2x3 rectangle somewhere in the grid. Keep only these cells and turn all other cells black.\\\\n46. To make the output, you have to identify a certain recurring pattern in the input matrix -- a horizontal 3 cells-wide streak of orange cells which is filled completely. Conservation of the orange streak happens in the output, leaving everything else as black. This is the transformation process.\\\\n47. To make the output, you have to look at the 4x3 rectangle composed by the 5th-8th rows and the 8th-10th columns in the input grid. The rows 3 to 5 of this rectangle are copied as rows 3 to 5 in the output grid. The rest of the output grid is filled with zeros.\\\\n48. To generate the output, you have to preserve only the 3x3 square with color 7, located in the middle of the input grid. The rest should be changed to black.\\\\n49. To make the output, you have to find the largest length of the continuous formation of the same number horizontally. Then retain this formation and turn every other number into 0 (black). If there is more than one formation with the same largest length, retain all.\\\\n50. To make the output, you need to maintain the configuration of 3 consecutive lines of the same color from the input. The observing colour is teal (7 on the scale). Discard all other colored squares and replace them with black squares. Therefore, the output grid will consist only of teal and black squares.\\\\n51. To make the output, you have to  scan the input grid and only copy the largest horizontal line of the same color other than black that you can find. The color of the line to keep will be green. All other pixels should be turned black in output.\\\\n52. To make the output, you have to look for the longest horizontal line of the same color/number that is not broken by any other color/number or the black background. This line will remain, while all other numbers become black cells in the output.\\\\n53. Take the 5th, 6th, and 7th columns in the 4th, 5th, and 6th rows which forms a 3x3 square. If the 3x3 square has only one kind of color, then take that 3x3 square to the output. The rest of the grid squares should be black.\\\\n54. To make the output, you have to inspect the input grid for a consecutive set of cells with the same color making up a horizontal line of length 3 or more. Once identified, retain these cells in the output grid and convert all other cells to black. If no such line exists, transform all cells in the output grid to black.\\\\n55. To transform the input grid into the output grid, you need to identify the middle section that contains a 3-cell-wide horizontal strip of 7 (yellow) repeated in three consecutive rows. This structure should be retained in the output. For all other cells not part of this pattern they should be converted to 0 (black).\\\\n56. To make the output, you have to find the sequence of three or more continuous \\'7\\' in any column. If such sequence exists, transfer it to the output grid in the same location. Otherwise, all the cells in the output grid should be 0.\\\\n57. To get the output, check the rows in the input. If a row contains the number 7 more than once, copy these cells to the output. All other cells should be black.\\\\n58. To make the output, you have to search for consecutive vertical line of the same color in the input grid, if it is found, copy that line in the same place on the output grid. The rest of the places in the output grid should be filled by black color cells.\\\\n59. To produce the output, you have to retain only a specific pattern, where 3 consecutive horizontal grey cells (represented by 7) can occur anywhere in the input grid. All other cells should be transformed into black cells. This pattern of 3 consecutive grey cells is carried over to the exact same position in the output grid, while everything else is turned black.\\\\n60. To make the output, you have to look for a square of contiguous color, which is not interrupted by black. Copy this square into the output grid in the exact same position while the rest of the grid should be set to black.\\\\n61. To shape out the output grid, identify the maximum continuous horizontal sequence of the same colored squares. Copy this sequence to the output grid while maintaining the position of the first cell in the sequence; the rest of the output grid should be left black.\\\\n62. To create the output grid from the input, the cells of the grid that contain three brown cells consecutively in a row are left as they are. All other cells are turned black.\\\\n63. To make the output, you have to look for identical adjacent numbers for 3x3 or larger squares in the input grid. When you find a 3x3 or larger square made up of the identical adjacent numbers. Copy this square from the input to the output grid at the exact position. If it doesn\\'t, leave the output square black.\\\\n64. To make the output, the transformation rule is simple, focus on the main central block which is of consistent color. If there is this color block, copy this color block to the output grid. If there is no such block, the entire output is black.\\\\n\"}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "Category 1: Rules focusing on specific colors or numbers\n1.1.

For each category, synthesize the rules into a single, specific rule that combines the ideas of all rules in that category, while clearly differentiating it from the other categories.\\\\nThe new rule should be as specific as possible, following the format of the given rules.\\\\nThe new rule should be applicable without any information from the original rules - i.e. it should be standalone.\\\\n\\\\nRules:\\\\n1. To make the output, you have to look at the center square of the input grid. If the color of the center square appears elsewhere in the grid, change all those squares to the color grey (5) in the output grid, while keeping the other squares the same.\\\\n2. To make the output, replace the unique numbers in the second row with the number 5, keep other numbers unchanged.\\\\n3. To obtain the output grid from the input you have to follow a simple procedure. The first and the third row will in every case be the same as the middle row. If they differ, change the color of the differing cell to grey in the output. The middle row always stays the same, i.e., it is copied straight into the output.\\\\n4. To make the output, you have to transform the center and corners of the input grid. If the center of the grid and the corners have the same color, keep the color as is. If the corner colors do not match the center color, change those corners to grey.\\\\n5. The transformation across all cases maps blue cells surrounded by different colors to grey. If a blue cell (mapped to \\'1\\') is surrounded vertically or horizontally by cells of a different color, it is mapped to grey in the output (mapped to \\'5\\'). All non-blue cells are kept as is in this transformation.\\\\n6. To make the output, you have to change only the numbers in the middle squares. If the middle square of the 1st row and 2nd column has a different number from the border numbers, change it to 5. If a middle square has the same number as the border, leave it as it is. Do the same for the squares of the 2nd row and the 1st and 3rd columns. So, the border stays the same only the 3 middle numbers change based on their match with the border numbers.\\\\n7. To make the output, replace all the cells in the middle row that are not of the same color as the cells in the first and last rows with the grey color. Also, change all the cells of the middle row that are of the same color as the cells in the first and last rows to the color of the cells of the first and last rows.\\\\n8. To make the output, check the middle cell of Input Grid, if it\\'s 1 or 2, leave it as it is. Transform all the cells with value 8 to 5 and keep the rest of the numbers same.\\\\n9. The output is created by the following pattern:  1. Keep the digits in the middle row the same if the initial digit of that row is the same as the other two numbers in that row.  2. Change the digits on rows where the initial digit is not the same as the other two digits in that row to 5. This means if the first and last number of a row match and the middle number does not match, the entire row\\'s numbers change to 5.  3. All other digits remain the same.\\\\n10. To make the output, you have to check each square for a specific condition: Any square that is not part of the middle row will transform into the squares on the top row. In other words, you have to replace the colors/IDs at first and the third rows with the color/ID in the top left square. For the middle row, transform squares which do not match the top row either if  they are different from the top left square.  The transformation step can be summarized as: Replace the color in the top row to all matching colors in the rest of the grid. Non-matching colors in the middle row should be turned into grey.\\\\n11. To make the output, you have to transform the non-border cells that aren\\'t the same color as the border cells into the color code 5 (grey).\\\\n12. To make the output, you have to check the middle column. If the middle column of the input grid has three different colors, replace all non-similar colors to grey in the output grid. If there are two or more same colored numbers in the middle column of input grid, keep them same in the output and replace all other colors with grey in the output grid. The first and third columns of the output remain the same as the input.\\\\n13. To make the output, you have to check each cell in the input. If a cell in top row matches the cell directly under it in the middle row, keep it as it is. But if they do not match and the cell in bottom row also does not match the top one, replace it with 5. If the cell in the top row does not match the cell in the middle row but matches the bottom cell, make the middle cell 5. Apply this rule to each cell. The rows shouldn\\'t be considered individually but each individual cell in a column should be compared with the other two cells in the same column from other rows.\\\\n14. To make the output, you have to compare the number in the central cell with the eight surrounding cells. If the number is different, replace the different numbers with the number 5. The central cell and the cells with the same number remain unchanged.\\\\n15. To make the output, you need to find cells with a different color than the one in the central cell of the first row and the first column. Change all such cells to grey (5). The other cells retain their original color.\\\\n16. For each square (cell) in the middle row of the input grid, if its color matches either of the colors of the squares above or below it, keep the same color in the output grid. if it does not match, change the color in the output to grey (5).\\\\n17. To get from the input grid to the output grid, the transformation pattern involves changing all squares that are surrounded by squares of a different color (fuschia, teal, yellow, and orange) to grey. The rest of the colored squares in the grid remain unchanged.\\\\n18. To make the output, you have to replace all the instances of the number 8 in the second and third rows of the input grid with the number 5. The first row and other numbers in the second and third rows remain unchanged.\\\\n19. To transform the input grid into the output grid, replace the number 8 (brown) with the number 5 (grey) only if there are other numbers around within the same grid. Maintain the original color if the number 8 (brown) is surrounded by the same number.\\\\n20. To make the output from the input, you need to turn all the cells that are not the same color as the middle cell in the middle row into gray. The remaining colored cells should keep their original colors.\\\\n21. To make the output, you have to replace red cells that are in the same position as an orange cell at the corners of the grid, or next to four blue cells in the input, by gray. Other cells remain unchanged.\\\\n22. To make the output, you have to change all values of 8 to 5 in the rows where 1 is not present. Leave the row as it is where 1 occurs. In a nutshell, the whole transformation process is replacing 8 with 5 except for a row that contains 1.\\\\n23. To make the output, you have to follow this rule: keep the middle row the same. For the top and bottom rows: if the middle cell of that row is different from both the left and the right cell, change all three cells to grey. Otherwise, keep the cells same.   This rule can be seen in Case 0: the middle cell in the top row (1) is not different from the left and right cell (2), thus the top row remains the same. The middle cell (8) in the bottom row is different from the left and right cell, thus change all cells to grey.\\\\n24. To make the output, you need to replace number 8 with number 5 except if number 8 is in a cell that is either completely surrounded by the same number or if number 8 is at the edge cell and all the edge cells contain the same number.\\\\n25. To make the output, you have to change the cells of the central row in the following way: If the color of the cell in the central row is the same as the color of the cell in the same column of the adjacent rows, keep it unchanged. But, if the color is different than that of the cells of the same column in the adjacent rows, change it to the color associated with number 5.\\\\n26. If the center square of the input grid (1,1) is the same color as either of the top left (0,0), top right (0,2), bottom left (2,0) or bottom right (2,2) squares, leave that square the same color in the output grid. If it is not the same color, it should be changed to grey in the output grid. All other squares should remain unchanged.\\\\n27. To create the output, for each cell on the edge, if a cell\\'s value differs from the corner cells, change it to 5. Everything else remains the same.\\\\n28. To make the output, you have to replace the color in the center position with gray and the remaining inside cells, excluding the outer frame, with a color which is the sum of the color from input center position and the color in the corresponding cell (up to 5 as the maximum color).\\\\n29. To make the output, you need to check if the cells at the same positions in first row and last row are the same. If the numbers in the cells are the same, retain the number in the middle row. If they are not the same, replace the middle row number with grey (number 5).\\\\n30. To make the output, each row is checked from top to bottom. If the cells in the first column and the third column of that row are of the same color, then this row stays the same in the output. If they are not of the same color, the cells in those rows are changed to grey in the output grid except for the middle cell, which remains the original color.\\\\n31. The transform involves only the cell in the middle of each row. If the cell in the middle has a different color than the cells to its sides (cell at the same row but different columns), change both side cells to grey. Otherwise, keep their color the same. The center cell\\'s color remains unchanged.\\\\n32. To make the output, replace any color that is not the dominant color (does not fill most sectors) in the same row or column with grey (5). Dominate colors are untouched. If there\\'s no dominate color, the row or column should become all-grey.\\\\n33. To transform the grid, compare the first (color1) cell in the middle row with the corresponding cells (color2) in the first and third rows. If color1 equals color2, leave the cell color unchanged in the output grid. If color1 does not equal color2, change the color of color1 cells in the output grid to grey. Follow this rule for all the cells in the middle row. The first and third rows in the output grid should be the same as the input grid.\\\\n34. To make the output, you have to identify the cells that are different from the color in the corners. Replace these cells with gray color (5). If the cell color is the same as the corner color, it remains the same.\\\\n35. To make the output, you have to keep the center row the same. For the top and bottom row, if the center cell isn\\'t the same color as the two side cells, or if the two side cells are different colors themselves, replace all the cells with color grey (5). If the center cell is the same color as the two side cells, keep the cells in the row as they were in the input.\\\\n36. To make the output, you have to convert any teal color in the corners of the grid to grey. If the corner cell is not teal, it remains the same color. The center cell and the cells in the middle of the sides stay the same color as they were in the input.\\\\n37. To make the output grid, you need to replace the central squares which are different from the corners by the grey color. The corners and the edges of the grid remain the same.\\\\n38. To make the output, you should replace the number 8 from the input with the number 5. The other numbers remain the same.\\\\n39. If a row in the input grid has more than one color (not including black), replace all other colored cells except the first one with grey. If a row in the input grid is composed of a single color (not including black), leave it as it is.\\\\n40. To make the output, you have to look at the center cell of each row. If this cell is blocked by a blue cell (1), replace the entire row with a grey cell (5), except for the blue center cell which stays as is. If the central cell is not a blue cell, then keep the entire row as it is.\\\\n41. To make the output, you have to look at each cell in the two outermost columns and rows. If the cell contains a digit from 1 to 3, then its color in the output should remain the same. If the cell contains a digit from 4 to 8, then its color in the output should be changed to grey, represented by the digit 5. Meanwhile, the center 3x3 cell remains the same as in the input.\\\\n42. To make the output, you need to replace the number 8 with number 5, no other numbers are changed during this transformation.\\\\n43. To make the output, you have to consider cells in the middle column. If any cell in the middle column doesn\\'t match with its corresponding cells in the left and right columns, replace that cell with grey (5). Rest of the cells in the middle column remain as it is. Outside columns remain the same as in the input grid.\\\\n44. To make the output, you need to compare the top and bottom row from the input grid (ignoring the central row). If a cell is teal in both rows, it remains teal in the output grid. However, if a cell has a different color in the input rows (one is teal, the other is either red or blue), it will be grey in the output. Finally, the central row in the grid is left untouched; it remains the same in the output as in the input.\\\\n45. To make the output, you have to replace the middle colours in the square. If the colour is on the vertical or horizontal centreline (not including corners), make it grey, else keep it as the original colour.\\\\n46. The transformation observes the border around the middle column. If a cell in the border is not of the same color as the cell lying in the same row of the middle column, then the cell in the border is changed to gray in the output, while the middle column stays the same.\\\\n47. To make the output, you have to replace the 8 (teal) or the 1 (blue) from the input by a 5 (grey) if these numbers are present at the equivalent position in the middle row or in the middle column. All other cells stay the same.\\\\n48. To make the output, you have to take the middle row in the input and keep it unchanged. The top and bottom rows are changed to the primary color of the middle row (blue, red, or green) in the input. If this primary color mixes with the color of the top and bottom rows (blue, red or green), the resulting mixed color (gray or fuchsia) will be the color of the top and bottom rows in the output grid.\\\\n49. Step 1: First, examine the middle row of the input grid. The middle-row is the key for transformation.  Step 2: If the middle-row contains three identical numbers (color), then the output grid is the same as the input grid.  Step 3: If the middle-row contains three different numbers (color), then the top and the bottom row of the output grid would be filled with the number 5 (grey color) while the middle-row would be the same as the middle-row of the input grid.  Step 4: If the middle-row contains two identical numbers (color) and one differing number, then replace the differing number of the top and the bottom row of the output grid with the number 5 (grey color). Other cells in the output would be the same as the corresponding cells in the input grid.\\\\n50. To make the output, you have to scan the input grid row by row. If you encounter anything apart from the color present on the leftmost and rightmost cell of a row, replace it with grey.\\\\n51. To make the output, you have to check the center square of the input. If the center square color appears in any of the corner squares, replace that corner color with the color gray. Keep all other squares the same.\\\\n52. To transform the grid, look at the middle row. If any cells in the top or bottom row do not match their corresponding cell in the middle row, change their color to grey in the output. If they do match, keep the same color in the output. The middle row always stays the same color in the output.\\\\n53. To make the output, you have to  look at the blocks\\' color. The blocks at the right and the left position of each row must be the same color, and if they are not the same color, change the color of the left block to grey. The rest should remain the same color.\\\\n54. To create the transformation, you compare each number in the input grid to the number in the center square. If the number in the outer square is less or equal than the center square, then keep it. If the number in the outer square is higher than the center square number, you change it to 5 in the output grid.\\\\n55. The transformation involves the diagonal cells, from the top left to the bottom right, and the cells that surround these diagonal cells. If the cell on either side of a diagonal cell has the same color as the diagonal cell, keep its color in the output. If the cell does not match the cell color on the diagonal, color it grey in the output. The diagonal cells and the rest cells stay the same color.\\\\n56. To make the output, you have to replace the different color (not black, blue, red) with grey color(5). The remaining colors in the grid will stay the same.\\\\n57. First, replace the black cells in the original grid with cells of number 5. Then, keep the middle rectangle from the input grid constant. If the rectangles above and below the middle rectangle in the input grid are not identical to the middle rectangle, replace those different number cells with cells of number 5.\\\\n58. To make the output, you have to change the inner cells which are not the same as the outer layer to grey (5). You keep all other cells as they are.\\\\n59. To make the output, you have to follow the following rule: - If any cell in the second or third row has the same color as the cells in the first row, then the color of that cell in the output becomes grey. - If the color of the middle cell of the second row (input grid) is different from the first row cells and also from any of the cells in the third row, then change the color of that cell to grey in the output. - Rest of the cells remain as they were in the input grid.   For instance, in Case 0, the first row is of color red, the middle cell in the second row is of color blue, which is different from the first row color and also from any of the cells in the third row, so it changes to color grey. Also, the last two cells in third row are of color red, which was the first row\\'s color, so these two also changes to color grey.\\\\n60. To make the output , you have to change every green (3) and teal (8) number to grey (5) unless if it\\'s in the middle row. If the number is in the middle row, it remains as it is. All other numbers remain the same as well.\\\\n\"}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "Category 1: Rules that involve the center square and its relation to other squares.\n- Rule: If the center square's color or number appears elsewhere in the grid or differs from the corners, change those squares to grey (5) in the output grid, while keeping the other squares the same.\n\nCategory 2: Rules that involve the transformation of specific numbers.\n- Rule: Replace specific numbers (such as 8, 1, or 2) with the number 5, unless they meet certain conditions (like being in the middle row, column, or surrounded by the same number).\n\nCategory 3: Rules that involve the transformation of rows based on their similarity or difference.\n- Rule: If the cells in a row are not identical or if they differ from the corresponding cells in other rows, change those cells to grey (5) in the output grid.

Repeat this process for every unit beneath each other and align their results vertically to generate the final output.\\\\n2. To make the output, you have to compress the input block by 1/2. Take each 2x2 block in the 2-outlined area and compress it into 1 single cell in the output. If more than half of the cells in a 2x2 block are 0, then the corresponding cell in the output should be 2. If more than half of the cells in a 2x2 block are colored differently from 2, then the corresponding cell in the output should be colored the same as the majority color.\\\\n3. To make the output, you should first consider the upper part of the input (from the top to the 8x8 red square). This part should be mirrored as the bottom part of the output. Then take the  8x8 red square with the yellow border (consider the color inside the yellow border only), trim off the yellow border, and then mirror it along the vertical axis. This mirrored red square will form the upper part of the output.\\\\n4. To make the output, you ignore the top, middle and bottom horizontal rows, start from the top-left of the large red square, taking every second tile in the row to the edge of the red square and then go down to the next row and repeat until you reach the bottom right corner of the red square. You replace the colours in the red square according to the pattern in the columns near the top and bottom of the input. If a tile is black, then the red square tile at the same location in the input becomes yellow. If a tile is not black, then the red square tile at the same location in the input takes on that color.\\\\n5. To make the output, you have to take the lower square of the input, then each row of this square is reduced by taking the middle part of each row. After that, the colored parts of the upper square from input are duplicated in the reduced lower square of the output at the corresponding position.\\\\n6. To make the output, you have to take every even-indexed (zero-indexed) row and column from only the red part of the input image to create a new smaller image containing the pixels of red and other colors (blue, green, yellow, teal) along with the black pixels if any. It seems like a downsampling operation where you keep only the even-indexed pixels from the red area only while cropping out the rest.\\\\n7. The process to produce the output follows the following steps: 1. Ignore the outermost layer of black cells in the input grid. 2. Each larger square (may contain smaller squares of different color) in the input map should be pared down into a single cell in the output such that this cell should take the color occurring most frequently in the larger square. 3. In case of a tie, the color value should be chosen based on the order from lowest to highest color number conventions.  4. Copy this color to the corresponding cell in the output grid. 5. Repeat these steps until the entire input grid has been transformed into the output grid of appropriate size.\\\\n8. The transformation consists of removing the black boundaries of the input grid, resulting in a grid displaying a simplified representation of the \"digital clock\" number in the center and the small squares in the corners. The center square \"digit\" maintains the number of segments and the same layout in the output grid as in the input, and the corners are unchanged. The colors from the input are faithfully represented in the output.\\\\n9. To make the output, you have to reduce the size of the original grid preserving the original layout of the red square. If in the full inner square of the red frame there is any teal square, the same position in the reduced output square should also be a teal square, otherwise it should be red square. All the remaining cells in the output grid will be red square.\\\\n10. To transform the grid, the input\\\\\\'s four rectangles defined by 2s (representing red color) are resized from 12 cells to 3 cells and then combined to from a 9x9 grid maintaining their original configuration. Also, the \"4\" shaped blocks overlayed on the condensed rectangles in the output grid are essentially the shrunken versions of the additional shapes that resided in the original rectangles and maintained the same orientation and proportional distances relative to each other.\\\\n11. To make the output, you should remove all rows and columns from the input grid where the presence of red squares is less than the amount that forms a square (equal to the amount of squares in one row or one column of red squares). This will create a smaller grid composed only of rows and columns filled with red squares and possibly other colors. Replace each counted set of three consecutive red squares, either horizontally or vertically, with an additional set of those squares in the positions above the first red square set (for horizontal sets) and to the left of the first red square set (for vertical sets), where possible. All other red squares or squares of different colors should remain unchanged. If a square\\\\\\'s position is occupied by a square in a different color, maintain the original color.\\\\n12. The output grid is essentially a stripped down version of the input, which retains the red squares forming a block and selected color squares within the block while removing all the black squares not included in the central red square block. Notably, the smaller square or line block at the upper part of the input is \"copied\" or \"imprinted\" into the larger red square block in the output, replacing some of the red squares. Colors scattered at the bottom of the input grid do not affect the output.\\\\n13. To make the output, you have to remove the black outer layer to isolate the red grid in the input. Then remove the outer layer of the red grid. After that, keep the colors of the other squares inside the red grid and replace all red squares with pink. So, the output grid is a 9x9 grid of pink squares with some squares of the other colors from the input.\\\\n14. For each car in the 9x9 train in the input, you have to map it to its matching location on a 9x9 grid. For example, the third car from the left in the top train goes to the second from top left cell in the corresponding 9x9 grid. You should retain any colors (representing items) already present in that car.\\\\n15. To make the output, you have to first divide the 19x19 input into 3x3 sectors. Each 3x3 sector in the output corresponds to a matching 3x3 sector in the input. Exclude the outer layers of black cells from input before mapping. When a 2 (red) cell is in the center of an input 3x3 sector, copy that center cell value as the value for every cell of the corresponding output 3x3 sector (making the entire sector red). Else, copy the center cell\\\\\\'s value to the corresponding output cell only. Treat all other values (beyond 2) in the same way, replicating the center value if it\\\\\\'s present, and copying directly if it\\\\\\'s not.\\\\n16. To obtain the output from the input, follow the steps:  1. Remove all the black cells at the borders.  2. Partition the remaining image in 3x3 boxes. In case the width and height of the image are not exactly divisible by 3, just ignore the cells that do not fit into a 3x3 box.  3. Each 3x3 box becomes one cell in the output image. The value of the cell in the output image is the unique value that appears in the corresponding 3x3 box in the input image. 4. Note that, for a 3x3 box to be considered as seen in the image, the central value decides the color for each box.  5. For black voids that lie between 3x3 boxes, it is ignored and not considered while forming the box. The outlined boxes represented in the output are\\\\n17. To make the output, you first need to remove the bottom part of the input grid containing the yellow, gray, green, and teal cells. Then move the remaining upper part to the bottom of the grid filling the new empty cells with black. Then you have to replace the red cells with the pattern seen below. Finally, for the rest of the cells that are empty in the input grid, replace them with red in the output grid.\\\\n18. To make the output, you have to extract the middle 9x9 square from the element. Then, overlay the smaller peripheral colored squares from the outside onto the central red square. Then adjust the color of the square as per the following rules:if a blue square is overlayed onto a red square it remains blue, if a teal square is overlayed onto a red square, it remains teal, and if a green square is overlayed onto a red square, it remains green.\\\\n19. 1. Remove the black margin if there are two or more continuous black cells around the grid.  2. Divide the grid into two  sections divided by the yellow line. 3. For the lower half, If there\\\\\\'s a blue box, turn this to a teal box on the output 4. For the upper half, if there\\\\\\'s a green box or a teal box, turn this to a blue box on the output 5. Keep the red boxes on the same position.\\\\n20. In order to transform the input grid to the output grid we image four corners which divide input grid into quadrants. Using those imaginary quadrants we reduce size of each quadrant of the input grid to come up with the output grid. We keep just the pixel that is in the center of each quadrant. Maintain the color of the center pixel in the larger version. This operation has the effect of reducing the grid size by half in each dimension (horizontally and vertically) and keep the color pattern of the input grid similar.\\\\n21. The output retains the red rectangles from the input, but has been reduced in size by removing the extra rows and columns of black cells. The patterns of other colored cells within the red rectangles are retained as well. This means removing the black rows and columns until we reach a bordering colored cell.\\\\n22. The output grid is a condensed version of the main body found in the bottom of the input grid. The drawings found in the compartments on top of the input grid will be inserted inside the correspond places in the main body in the output grid according to their position. If in the main body \\\\\\'2\\\\\\'s were replaced by \\\\\\'0\\\\\\'s, then this spot in the output will be replaced by the drawing corresponding to that area. If the \\\\\\'2\\\\\\'s were not replaced, then the output retains the \\\\\\'2\\\\\\'s. The drawings from the compartments are reduced in size to fit the smaller output grid size.\\\\n23. To make the output, you have to remove the red cells from the outside border from the input grid, maintaining the rest of the grid configuration the same as the input.\\\\n24. The transformation should be done like this: - Retain the broad red framework, which depicts a vertical ribbon-like structure in the centre of the grid. - Sense the positions of the different colors like green, blue, and grey from the top and bottom segments of the grid. - Replace black with a red number at the relative positions of these colors on the red tape. Note that the dimensions of the output grid are different from the input, indicating scaling down.\\\\n25. To make the output, remove the edges of the initial 9 x 10 grid and replace cells with colored squares depending on their neighbors. Specifically, if a red cell in the input grid shares a border with a grey cell, it should change to green in the output grid. If it borders a blue cell, it turns blue. If it borders a teal cell, it turns teal. If a red cell doesn\\\\\\'t border any colored cell, it stays red. Black cells in the original 9 x 10 grid become black in the output.\\\\n26. To make the output, you have to compress each 3x3 square of the input into a single cell, mapping the colour to the colour that occurs most often within each 3x3 space in the input. If all colours occur equally, revert back to the red (number 2) as a default. This creates a compressed version of the red squares and other colored patterns.\\\\n27. To make the output, you have to extract only the red cross section from the input grid and retain all the non-red colors that exist there. Red (2) squares in the cross shape of the input grid should remain red (2) in the output grid. Transform the colors within the red (2) cross shape according to the following mappings: green (3) squares become blue (4) squares, blue (1) squares become green (3) squares, and teal (8) squares remain the same. The grey (5) checkerboard pattern and any other elements outside of the red cross shape are omitted from the output.\\\\n28. Each cell of the output grid directly corresponds with a cell from the large 10x10 red square in the input grid. The number in the output cell is determined by the color in the corresponding input cell and in the two cells directly \\\\\\'above\\\\\\' it (in the rows at the top and bottom of the input). If both cells are red or black, the output cell is red. If one of the cells above is blue, the output cell is blue. If one of the cells above is gray, the output cell is gray. If one of the cells above is orange, the output cell is orange. If one of the cells above is teal, the output cell is teal. This transformation can be viewed as each cell in the output taking on the non-red color from the \\\\\\'stack\\\\\\' of cells in the input (if such a color exists).\\\\n29. To make the output, you have to take the butterfly shape from the input, remove the last columns from both ends (so now we have a 9x9 shape) and replace all the cells according to the following rules: - If the cell was black or red (0 or 2), it stays the same - If the cell was teal (8), become red (2) - Any green cells (3) become black (0) - Yellow or grey cells (4 or 5) both become a teal cell (8)\\\\n30. To transform the input grid to output, you should extract the inner pattern excluding the outer black boundary. In this inner pattern, replace red squares with black squares in the sections of the grid that have numbers other than red. Other than these sections, all squares in the inner grid should remain red.\\\\n31. To make the output, you have to reduce the overall size by removing the empty spaces, combining the top, middle and bottom parts in order and reducing their relative size while maintaining their color patterns and positions of objects in each part. In short, compress the grid and maintain the relative size and location of colored squares.\\\\n32. To make the output, you have to find the large square of red 2s in the input grid and convert it to a smaller square of red 2s of same size in the output grid. Next, look at the smaller 2s squares inside the large square in the input and copy their position exactly in the large square in the output. The colored squares (4s - yellow, 8s - teal, 1s - blue, and 3s - green) are ignored when creating the output. Lastly, the series of 2s at the bottom of the input grid should be ignored.\\\\n33. The transformation takes the center part of the image which contains the red squares, discard every second column and row from this part. Then, replace the inner part of the grid where the yellow, orange, and teal squares are, take the same portion from the very top of the grid and place it here. The rest remains red.\\\\n34. The pattern is to transform the big square in the middle into a 9x9 square. The color of each small square in the middle square is determined by comparing the colors of the corresponding squares above and below. If the square is surrounded by two squares of the same color, then the middle square becomes that color. If the middle square is red surrounded by two teal squares, the middle square turns teal. Two squares of different colors surrounding the middle square result in the middle square staying red.\\\\n35. To transform the input grid into the output grid, first, the complete bottom part of the input grid is taken and reduced by a factor of 2. This means creating a new small square of 9x9 by skipping every second line and every second column. The red squares of the larger grids become red in the small grid. If a yellow or blue grid cell is present in the larger grid where we now draw a small grid cell, the small grid cell becomes an 8. If a green or red grid cell is present in the large grid where we now draw a small grid cell, the small grid cell should become a 4; other colors should be represented by red.\\\\n36. The transformation process is quite complicated. Here is a step-by-step explanation:  1. Start from the fourth position of the column right after the end of the central D shape. Go down and take the pixel color. If it\\\\\\'s red or black, ignore it. Record the first non-red, non-black color you encounter.  2. Keep going down recording the color of the pixels you encounter until you reach the end of the column. If you encounter a red or black color, don\\\\\\'t record anything. 3. Go to the next column and repeat the process again. 4. At the end of this process, you should have a grid of 16x9 or 8x8 size which keeps the colored pattern of the shapes in the four outer parts of the central D shape. In the process you should ignore the central D shape itself.   5. If you encounter blue color, convert it into red color in the output. If you encounter green color, convert it into blue color in the output.\\\\n37. To make the output, Firstly, discard the outermost black square rows and columns from the input grid. Then move to the central figure. For each red square in the central figure, if it is surrounded by three black squares forming a right angle to its left, change the square to orange; if it is surrounded by three black squares forming a right angle to its right, change the square to yellow; if it is surrounded by three black squares forming a right angle on top, change the square to green; if it is surrounded by three black squares forming a right angle at the bottom, change the square to blue; and if it is not surrounded by three black squares forming a right angle, maintain the square as red. The remaining figures, whether blue or teal, should be treated as if they were red.\\\\n38. To make the output, you have to group the different sections into one. Every two black lines form boxes that need to be reshaped together. The multicolored sections at the top should be reduced, and their boxes formed by removing all the black squares that form a cross, leaving only the corner squares. The blue and red sections at the bottom should also be reduced, also removing the black squares that form a cross. The large red area in the middle stays red. The black lines surrounding the sections disappear, leaving only the line at the border.\\\\n39. You should start by making the entire output grid red. Then check the rows of squares on the bottom of the input grid. Starting from the right on the bottom row, replace the color of the corresponding square in the output grid with that color. Continue in a counter clockwise rotation until you have replaced each square in the output that corresponds to a square in the input.\\\\n40. To make the output, start from the input grid. Remove the black borders, then select the second through the tenth row from the top and the second through the tenth column from the left. This will get rid of the outer boundaries of black squares and the row/column on the interior of them, leaving behind the blue, green, and teal squares that were surrounded by red. Whatever number combination is left after removing these boundaries will become the new output grid.\\\\n41. To make the output, scale down the 2-coded areas that are found in the input layout by totally excluding the margins and maintain the patterns created inside these bigger squares. If you encounter figures coded 4 and 8 while doing this, just scale down these as well. Figures with codes 1, 3, and 5 are perfectly excluded from the output figure, and the same applies to the empty parts (0 coded parts) found in the input figure.\\\\n42. To create the output, you need to crop the red square from the input and maintain any colored shapes contained inside it. Therfore, keep only the part of the input grid corresponding to the large red square and the colored shapes within it. The relative positions of all cells should be preserved.\\\\n43. To make the output, you have to focus on the rings surrounding the red core in the input. From these rings, create a new smaller grid where each row represents one of the rings from the outside inward. Keep only every 2nd cell of the row and color them respectively, leaving out the surrounding black cells. The first ring, the outermost one, ends up being the first row in the output, and so on. If a ring is incomplete, as seen in the Input Case 0 where the blue and green rings are split into two parts, consider it as one whole ring when transforming.   Special cases: Ignore the red core and the black border surrounding it when transforming.\\\\n44. To make the output, you need to reduce the size of the large square last three rows and columns. If there were 4 small colored cells on the top or the bottom of the input grid, the corresponding cell in the output should be colored as that. If there were 8 small colored cells around the cell on larger square, the corresponding cell should be colored in green; if four of them, color it yellow; otherwise, color it red.\\\\n45. To make the output, you remove the black cells and the space between in horizontal direction to create a compact grid. Then, you take the different colors that were inside your input and place them correspondingly into your output grid to create the same 2x2 cell pattern with color accents. The color of the accents depends on the particular colors of the accents in the input grid.\\\\n46. To make the output, you have to process as follow:   1. Scale down the top-right quarter of the red square by 1/2 along both the x and y axes. Make sure to scale down the shapes within the red square as well.  2. Keep the colors of the cells identical to their colors in the input. 3. The resulting grid should have the same color composition as the input, but it is a smaller version.\\\\n47. To make the output, you have to downscale the larger square and its content, maintaining the color representation. The outer border of the larger square is not considered in the downsizing. Ignore the extra squares below the larger one in the input.\\\\n48. The transformation process appears to incorporate a reflection and shrinking in properties.The picture in the top is reflected to the bottom with the shapes inside the box rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise. The analogue parts with same color in both parts are meshed into one part with the color of the center part of the top image.   Each 2x2 square from the Input maps to a single cell in the Output. The value for the output cell is determined by the bottom-right cell within the corresponding input square.  In more detail:  1. Divide the raw input into 2x2 regions in a grid manner. 2. Pick the bottom-right value of each 2x2 sub-grid and use this value to form the output grid.\\\\n49. To create the output, firstly, the red structure as well as the integrated structures within it in the input grid is captured and any internal colors or patterns are retained. However, the smallest of the internal structures, the ones that are usually bordered by black lines, are represented as red cells instead of their unique colors. The black bordering as well as the black patterning within the structures is discarded and the cells are filled with red. The remaining black cells in the large square or rectangle are also filled with red. The final output is the original overall structure but it is predominantly filled with red and some of the original internal colors.\\\\n50. To produce the output grid, four steps are followed. First, the borders of the grid are removed. Then, the third and seventh rows are replaced by the first row of the four-row pattern found from the 21st row in the input. The fourth and eighth rows are replaced by the fourth row of the same pattern found in the input. Finally, the 5th-6th rows and 9th-11th rows are filled with number 2.\\\\n51. The output grid contains red cells from the middle shape of the center of the input grid, excluding the black cells. Each non-black and non-red cells that surround this shape, is copied on to the corresponding position in the output grid, if they exist. This implies that the pattern takes the middle 9x9 square of the red shape on the input grid, retaining the internal colors and structure, and overlays it with the outer color if it exists. If an outer color overlaps with an inner color or red, the outer color takes precedence on the output grid.\\\\n52. To make the output, you have to take the middle part of the input grid, which is surrounded by the red square or the next layer after the black outermost layer in the input. Then, check for the pattern or group of patterns appearing outside the red square at the top and the bottom of the grid \u2013 these patterns are overlaid onto the central red square. If there is a color other than black in this pattern, it takes the place of the red in the corresponding position of the output grid. If the square in the pattern is black, the red square in the corresponding position of the output retains its color.\\\\n53. To make the output, you need to preserve the 3x2 shapes inside the outer grid, ignoring the 3x2 shapes with black squares (0\\\\\\'s).   The entire smaller internal grid needs to be moved to the output, maintaining its current format, but placing the internal shapes according to the position of the number 2\\\\\\'s in the biggest shapes of the initial image. If needed, the internal shape should be rotated 90 degrees anti-clockwise to fit the maximum width and height.  The bands of 8\\\\\\'s are not part of the original 3x2 shapes, but they need to be included as part of the output in the same location as in the input.   For example, an \"8\" in the shape\\\\\\'s equivalent position in the following array would be ignored.  Overall, translate the shapes according to the positions of the original 3x2 blocks, whilst also maintaining the relative position of the 8\\\\\\'s\\\\n54. To form the output grid, first consider only the inner part of the red box in the input grid. Then, superimpose the blue pattern from the bottom of the input grid (limited to the same size as the red box) onto the red box, replacing red (2) with yellow (4), if blue (1) from the pattern exist. After that, replace the rest of the red (2) in the red box to blue (1).\\\\n55. To make the output, you have to extract the first  9 columns of the red blocks, and replace the red blocks by the corresponding colored squares in the middle section, ignoring the black row. Perform this for both the top and bottom of the output grid.\\\\n56. To make the output, you have to first find the largest square of red cells in the input. Then within that square any colored cells (green, blue, gray) must be transferred to the output grid in the same relative position. If there are white cells in the input grid, they should be replaced by red cells in the output. Ignore all cells outside of the largest red square in the input while generating the output.\\\\n57. The transformation of the grid seems to follow these steps: 1. Shrink the entire grid to a red 9x9 grid. 2. Look for colored (that are not red) cells in the bottom layer of the input grid, which are found only in the 2nd and 4th rows of that layer with respect to the separating black row. Copy these colored cells to the equivalent rows in the output grid, the 3rd and 5th rows respectively, maintaining their horizontal relativity to the other cells. 3. The rest of the grid remains red.\\\\n58. To make the output, you have to remove the black lines dividing the sections inside the rectangle, keeping the overall shape and the inside colored patterns intact.\\\\n59. Remove all black strips/grid lines in the input grid, then replace the remaining colored cells with red cells (2), except for the ones that were initially surrounded by black cells. The latter should retain their original color.\\\\n60. To make the output, select the middle 9x9 grid from the input. Replace any colour that is not red with black except for the groups of three squares that lies on the middle row of the extreme left and right of the 9x9 grid. Change the color of these squares to green.\\\\n61. To make the output, you have to take the all-black rows both from the top and bottom out first. Then reduce the remaining figures by one count horizontally and vertically in a manner that gives a smooth symmetrical look. Finally, replace the complex shapes made up of 2 or more cells with simple single cells of varying colors.\\\\n62. Take the smaller block or cluster from the top of the input grid and merge each corresponding cell with the corresponding cell of the lower larger block. If the cells in the two blocks are identical, keep the value in the output. If the cells in the two blocks are different, keep the non-black cell\\\\\\'s value. The rest of the grid which doesn\\\\\\'t have a corresponding cell in the smaller block is just copied to the output from the larger block. The black cells around the blocks are not transformed to the output.\\\\n63. To form the output, We first divide the grid into parts around the green lines. Then within each part, we count the number of black boxes and the number of red boxes. If there is any blue, we treat it as a red. If there is any fuchsia, we treat it as a green. Finally, rescale each part from the input grid into a 1x1 box in the output grid. If there was an even number of black boxes, fill that box in the output grid with red. Otherwise, fill it with green.\\\\n64. The transformation rules are as follows. First, the inner grid, not including a border of 2 cells around and including the teal cells and 1 cell around and including any other color, is preserved directly in the output grid. Second, the blue cells are replaced with red cells in the corresponding positions in the output. The outer rows and columns of the inner grid are filled such way that the output grid is 9x9. If the second last row or column of the input grid contains red cells, they are included in the output. The rest are filled with red cells.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "Category 1: Unwrapping and Flattening\nRule: Unwrap each unit into a flattened array, starting from the top left and leaning towards the right.

To make the output, you have to move the top grey colored part downwards to maintain the domino pattern in the middle of the grid. The top part of the grid should replace the grey part at the bottom. Remove the grey part from the top and fill the top line with black. Similarly, the bottom yellow part should move upwards to replace the yellow part at the top while being removed from the bottom.\\\\n2. To make the output, you need to move the lower structure to replace the upper one, the structures are symmetrical and have the same size. Then, fill the bottom half of the grid with black or empty spaces. In essence, a vertical flipping is performed on the lower structure to replace the upper one, leaving bottom part empty.\\\\n3. To make the output, you have to move the pattern of the blue boxes in the same orientation as the grey boxes are arranged. The pattern of the blue boxes is copied to the place of grey boxes and the pattern of the grey boxes is made black.\\\\n4. To obtain the output, the transformation consists of deleting all squares of the grid that are not part of the central yellow column. It also includes replacing the color of the remaining squares from grey to red.\\\\n5. To make the output, you have to move the blue shape to replace the green shape and erase the original blue shape. Then leave the rest of the grid black.\\\\n6. The transformation involves moving one of the color horizontal lines up to replace the other color horizontal line while leaving the place it originally occupies as empty black colored cells. Specifically, the horizontal line in grey replaces the horizontal line in yellow. After the transformation, the thin line of the third color that dissects the initial grey line also disappears.\\\\n7. To make the output, replace the teal color in the bottom rectangle with grey color such that the positions of teal and grey color are exchanged, leaving black and red color untouched.\\\\n8. To make the output, check the widths of the colorful rectangles, then replace the smaller rectangle by repeating the larger one. If the larger rectangle is on the left side of the line and the smaller rectangle is on the right side, exchange their sides in the output. Keep all other elements the same as in the input.\\\\n9. To make the output, you have to remove the small teal-coloured rectangle from the input grid. Simply copy the rest of the grid from input to output. The final transformation should result in large yellow button shape on the top and a clear black space beneath it.\\\\n10. To make the output, you need to take the bottom half of the grid, including the middle row of colored shape, flip it upside-down, and replace the upper half of the grid with it. The lower half of the output grid shall remain black.\\\\n11. To make the output, you have to perform a mirror reflection of the multi-colored shape across the green vertical mid-line. The reflection causes the second yellow line and the upper red line to disappear while the resulting blue and red stripes remain the same in size and position.\\\\n12. To make the output, move the pattern of the lower block up to replace the upper block completely while retaining the boundary box created by the different color in the upper block. The former position of the lower block then becomes a black block.\\\\n13. To make the output, you need to see if there are any yellow shapes (4) in the input grid. If there are, replace them with a grey (5) shape of the same size in the output. If there are no yellow (4) shapes in the input, copy the grid exactly as it is to the output.\\\\n14. To make the output, you have to erase the single vertical grey column from the top and move all the center horizontal grey square grids to replace the yellow square grids at the top. All the other grids including the innermost teal grids remain the same. All spaces left out as a result of transformations should be filled with black.\\\\n15. To get the output from the input, we first need to maintain the top 2 lines above the yellow shape intact. Then, for the yellow shape, we maintain the top 3 horizontal lines and bottom line but we remove all its black vertical lines. For the red shape, we simply remove it along with all the lines inside it. The remaining lines and space below the yellow shape are kept unchanged.\\\\n16. To make the output, you have to move the green shape up, placing it at the same height as the red line. The rest of the grid, including the original position of the green shape, should be filled with black cells.\\\\n17. To transform the grid to the output, erase the green line located between the red and grey figures, and move the grey rectangle to the top to take the position of the green stripe, leaving only black cells in its previous position.\\\\n18. To transform the input into the output, the following operations should be performed. If there is a horizontal line of squares (5 squares wide) in the middle of the grid and two rectangles below and above it, remove the rectangles and move the horizontal line down to take the position of the rectangle at the bottom. If there are only rectangles without a line of squares, leave the grid as it is.\\\\n19. To make the output, you have to shift the blue and teal segments downwards, dropping the empty/black segment to the bottom end of the grids. The teal segment will take the position former position of the blue segment while the blue one will be shifted to the middle.\\\\n20. To make the output, you have to remove all the black lines of the flag shape. This leaves only the colored square at the top and the colored lines in the middle, forming an enlarged flag shape.\\\\n21. To get the output grid from the input grid, shift the blue rectangles upward such that they are touching the top boundary and also shift the red square upward by the exact number of rows as the blue rectangles. Any empty spaces are filled with black cells.\\\\n22. The transformation consists of swapping the location of the top and middle segments. The top segment with one row of red cells becomes the new middle segment while the middle segment with the grey cells in the form of English letter \\'T\\' is moved to become the new top segment. The bottom segment stays in the same location.\\\\n23. To make the output, you have to remove the yellow shape. Then, replace the red shape with the position of the light blue shape and fill in where the red shape had been with the color black.\\\\n24. To make the output, you have to remove the bottom component and move the middle component to fill the space. The top component remains unchanged.\\\\n25. The grid transformation involves only the cross. To make the output, you have to swap the color of the shape within the cross and black pixels in the innermost (3rd layer) of the cross. The structure of the first colored rectangle remains unchanged. To be more specific, the layers of the cross are filled from outermost to innermost with color, black, color. This should be changed to color, color, black in the output.\\\\n26. To make the output, you have to keep the red lines as they are, and reposition the green lines to cover the teal line completely. The space previously occupied by the green lines should be converted to black.\\\\n27. To create the output, we should remove the narrow band of numbers 3, and slide the wider band of numbers 3 upwards to fill the space. This gives a smaller upper group of numbers 3.\\\\n28. To make the output, remove the yellow and purple color and replace it with the background color. Move the green color from its current location to the place previously occupied by the yellow or purple color (ie, a vertical bar in the center of the grid).\\\\n29. To make the output, you have to move the blue blocks directly below the red block and move the green block directly below the blue blocks. The order of each individual block and their size remains the same. All other space should remain black.\\\\n30. To make the output, you have to look at vertical structures in the input. If a column is fully or partially colored, color the whole column, do not change the color of any cells that are part of any horizontal line in the grid. If a vertical structure does not exist in the input, copy what is already in the cell from the input.\\\\n31. To make the output, you have to remove the yellow lines and move the green lines to where the yellow lines were. Leave everything else the same.\\\\n32. To make the output, you have to move all the colored cells (non-black cells) to the center of the grid and align them vertically. All other cells should be black. The order of the cells in the colored columns should remain the same after transformation. If there are any black cells within the colored square in the input, these should also be kept at the same position in the output. If the column of colored cells in the input is wider than one cell, the column should be narrowed to be one cell wide in the output by taking the cell nearest to the center of the input from each row of colored cells.\\\\n33. To transform the input into the output grid, the transformation focuses on the vertical bar. The transformation involves replicating the original vertical bar over the \\'normal\\' horizontal bar, while the intersected horizontal bar is deleted. Hence, the transformation consists of overwriting the values of the horizontal bar cells with the corresponding cells from the vertical bar. When the vertical bar ends, the cell values continue to be overwritten with black (denoted as \\'0\\').\\\\n34. To make the output, you have to keep the red (2) sections and largest green (3) section of the grid, while replacing all other colored sections with black (0). This effectively leaves you with a grid featuring the red (2) sections and the horizontal green (3) section, surrounded by black (0).\\\\n35. To make the output, perform a horizontal flip of the input grid, this will retain the top half while the maroon rectangle becomes a straight maroon line in the middle and few scattered teal boxes towards bottom turn into black.\\\\n36. In the transformation, the yellow (4) squares in the input grid are replaced by the color of the stripe they belong to. The height of the colored stripe doesn\\'t change, but its position shifts as the stripe moves upward to replace any black squares that may have been above it, resulting in the stripe becoming taller if there were any black cells above it. Any cells beneath what was previously the bottom of the stripe now become black.\\\\n37. To make the output, you have to eliminate all the grey squares that are not integrated into the grey rectangle in the middle. The upper part of the rectangular is copied and pushed down to replace the eliminated squares. The rest of the grid is kept same as the input.\\\\n38. To make the output, you have to remove a part of the coloured strip formed by the cells that appears silhouettes of letters, keeping the largest continuous coloured strip intact.\\\\n39. To transform the input grid into the output grid, start by identifying the colored strips and columns. The transformation involves moving the column to align with the corresponding strip horizontally, to form a single colored strip on the grid. All other cells remain unchanged.\\\\n40. The transformation process involves shifting the larger block of squares in place of the smaller one, while the smaller block of squares is replaced with black squares (essentially disappearing). The rest of the grid stays black.\\\\n41. To make the output, you have to remove the shapes that do not fill the entire width of the grid. Keep the horizontal shapes and erase the rest.\\\\n42. To make the output, you have to remove the stem (or vertical line) of the \\'T\\' while the rest remains the same. So, you should end up with the horizontal line of the \\'T\\' left.\\\\n43. To make the output, you should replace the whole colored block below the skinny horizontal line with black squares. Then, move the colored band that is several squares above the skinny horizontal line to several squares below the skinny horizontal line, filling the space where the colored block used to be. Everything else remains the same.\\\\n44. To turn the input grid into the output grid, you have to replace the smaller yellow shape with the larger yellow shape. The larger yellow shape remains the same. The position of the teal vertical line does not change.\\\\n45. To make the output, you have to look at the inner smaller rectangle of 2s and the larger rectangle of 3s. If the smaller rectangle of 2s fits inside the larger rectangle of 3s with no overlap on any side and at least a gap of 1 row/column of 0s (black) on all sides, then remove the vertical line of 3s separating the 0s (black) and the larger rectangle of 3s. If the smaller rectangle doesn\\'t fit inside the larger rectangle then leave the grid as is.\\\\n46. To make the output, you have to remove the small colored blocks located at either side of the major colored region in the rectangular block. Keep the upper smaller region as it is and expand the major colored region to cover the areas left by the removed small blocks.\\\\n47. To make the output, you have to delete the green line and push the teal rectangle up to touch the yellow rectangle, then black out the space that used to cover by the teal rectangle.\\\\n48. In every column, the pattern of the transformation from the input to the output is as follows: The turquoise rectangle (if present) is shifted to replace the position of the yellow rectangle, the yellow rectangle (if present) is replaced by black/empty cells and the gray line stays untouched (if present).\\\\n49. The transformation pattern is that the middle section of pattern 3 is merged to appear as one solid block i.e., it is compressed towards the center of the grid. The pattern 2 and 4 remain unchanged whereas pattern 3 (if not centered) is removed.\\\\n50. To make the output, shift the vertical block to the middle in place of the horizontal block and then remove the previous vertical block position. After shifting, remove any residual blocks above or beneath the central block.\\\\n51. To make the output, you have to swap the positions of the two patterns in the input grid whilst maintaining their original shape. In other words, the pattern that starts at the leftmost of the input grid goes to the second half of the output grid. Similarly, the pattern that starts from the second half of the input grid moves to the first half of the output grid. Overall, it looks like the two patterns have swapped their positions in the output grid.\\\\n52. To make the output, you need to leave the top rectangle and the stripe unchanged, while entirely removing the bottom rectangle and replacing it with black.\\\\n53. To make the output, you have to delete the vertical colored line from the input grid and shift the part colored line on the right side of the vertical line to the position of the vertical line.\\\\n54. To make the output, you have to keep the top and bottom sections the same as in the input grid. Look at the bulky middle section, notice how it is divided into two portions? You have to change the grid by taking the far left portion of the middle section and slide it to the far right. The remaining portion of green bricks gets filled up the emptied space leaving no gap between the top red bricks and the green bricks, no leftover grey bricks either. This gives for a neat grid output.\\\\n55. To make the output, shift the group of squares towards the middle of the grid until they meet. The number of black squares between the two sets should be reduced to zero. The squares of the sets that are on the border with the black cells should be replaced by black cells.\\\\n56. To make the output, you have to remove the second shape (the stretched rectangle or line) completely and replace it with empty space. Leave the first rectangular shape in its place, unchanged.\\\\n57. To transform the input grid to the output, you need to remove the smaller blocks (blue or red) situated vertically between the major (yellow) block and replace it with the color of the major block, while the remaining areas outside the major block should be left empty (black).\\\\n58. To make the output, you have to move the horizontal rectangle up to replace the corresponding colored area in the top rectangle and eliminate the middle colored rectangle. Keep the other black cells as black.\\\\n59. To make the output, the figures are joined, making the shape of the smaller figure (the one initially in the upper half) slide towards the larger figure remaining in the same orientation. Any figure in the way is obliterated.\\\\n60. To make the output, eliminate or replace with black all colors except for the largest shape or group of the same color, which in this case is the block of turquoise squares arranged in the below midpoint quadrant. Move this turquoise block upwards replacing the yellow rectangle. This means that the largest color grouping remains and is moved to replace the sizable color grouping at the upper quadrant of the grid.\\\\n61. To make the output, you have to move the yellow \\'T\\' shape to the location of green line, have the green line overlap the yellow \\'T\\' shape that moved down, and then erase the original grey \\'T\\' shape at the bottom.\\\\n62. In the output grid, the portion of the least frequent color in the input grid is kept as is and others are turned into black. If two or more colors have the same lowest frequency, we choose to keep the first one that appears in reading order - top to bottom, left to right.\\\\n63. To make the output, you have to rotate the entire grid 180 degrees so the rectangle that was on top is now on the bottom and the rectangle that was on the bottom is now on the top. Then, replace the inner black rectangle of the colored rectangle with the color of that rectangle. All other colored cells outside this inner rectangle should remain black. The black cells at the perimeter remain the same.\\\\n\"}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "Category 1: Movement of shapes or patterns\n1.

The pattern extends backward from the original blue square and repeats itself every N+1 row, where N is the number of squares in each row of the grid.\\\\n3.

You repeat this until you reach the right edge of the grid, then, you move up to the next row and continue this striped pattern. Repeat this until you reach the top row of the grid.\\\\n12. To make the output, you have to keep the blue squares in the same position and fill all black square with blue from the bottom to the top, in a diagonal way from the right to left. In this way, the areas above the diagonals will remain black, whereas the area under the diagonals will be filled with blue.\\\\n13. 1. Firstly, identify the position of the blue cell in the input grid. 2. Next, in the output grid, copy this cell to every other row. For single rows, add a blue cell at the first position. For double rows, add a blue cell at the second position. For triple rows, add a blue cell at the third position, and so on. Always keep the rightmost cells black. 3. Maintain the status of black cells in places where blue cells are not added.  In summary, the pattern involves copying the position of the blue cell in the bottom row of the input grid to every other alternating row of the output grid.\\\\n14. To transform the input into the output, you have to look at the row with the blue square and move the blue square up one cell, then move to the cell to its right and make it blue. Continue alternating positions in this way up to the top row. In the end, every row should have one blue square, and its position should be moving along a waving pattern. The idea is that with each new row, the blue square moves one step right and one upwards.   Describing why the shape changes in this way: The pattern seems to represent a repeating alternation (like a zigzag or checkerboard pattern) that starts over with each row - each blue cell is taking the place of the black cell diagonally top-right to the blue cell in the row below.\\\\n15. To make the output, you need to create a diagonal pattern of blue squares starting from the bottom left corner going to the top right corner, so that there is only one image of a blue square on each row and each column. The rest of the grid should remain black.\\\\n16. To make the output, you have to fill in each column of the grid starting from bottom to top. If there is a blue cell in the bottom of a column for the input grid, fill in each cell of that column of the output grid alternately with blue and black cells starting with a blue cell at the bottom. If the column in the input grid does not contain a blue cell, leave the column in the output grid all black.\\\\n17. To make the output, you have to draw a diagonal of blue boxes starting from the position of the blue box to the top right corner, with the rest being black. The pattern for the blue boxes starts from the bottom left and alternates between left and right for each consecutive row.\\\\n18. To make the output, you start from the lower-left corner and move diagonally upwards towards the upper-right corner, alternating the position of the blue cell in a zig-zag manner. For every new row, shift the blue cell one place to the right. If the blue cell reaches the right end of the grid, start from the leftmost position again. All other cells remain black.\\\\n19. The transformation involves creating a diagonal pattern of blue cells. Start from the bottom left corner, where the solitary blue square is located in the input. Moving up diagonally from this point to the right, alternate between black and blue cells. When you encounter the right or top boundary of the grid, begin again from the next row (from left to right) or column (from bottom to top). If a column or row has been started, always continue from the next cell in the same column or row, not from the bottom left.    In a nutshell, the blue cells are shifting diagonally up and to the right, creating a checkerboard pattern. The pattern only moves when it hits the boundary of the grid, at which point it starts moving in the opposite direction (upwards if moving right, and rightwards if moving up).\\\\n20. To make the output, you have to create a diagonal line with a blue cell. Starting from the bottom left where the blue cell is located, fill with a blue cell the cell that is one column to the right and one row above in a zig-zag pattern.\\\\n21. To make the output, you have to transform the bottom row of the grid and then propagate this pattern upwards. The blue dot in the bottom row is pushed to the right and becomes the first blue dot in the row above. This is repeated until the top row is reached. The position of the blue dot in each row alternates from the leftmost spot in one row to the rightmost spot in the row above, and vice versa, creating a zig-zag pattern up the grid.\\\\n22. To make the output, you have to fill the grid with a diagonal of blue cells starting from the bottom left corner, moving upward and to the right. The color pattern alternates between black and blue, with the bottom left cell starting as blue.\\\\n23. To make the output grid, you have to diagonally flip the blue square from the bottom left corner of the input grid to the top right corner of the output grid. You also have to alternate turning blue and black squares in the path moving from bottom to top left corners. The starting square on the diagonal should be blue.\\\\n24. To make the output, you have to create a zigzag pattern starting with blue from the bottom left corner of the grid. The zigzag pattern fills the grid leaving black cells wherever the blue cells do not fill. The width of the path for the zigzag pattern is considered as 1 cell, moving top right from its initial position, then moving top left whenever the top or right boundary of the grid is hit, and vice versa. The top-left cell needs to be black.\\\\n25. To make the output, you have to fill the cells of each row with a combination of blue and black colors following a certain pattern: You start from the rightmost cell in each row making it blue and then you skip a cell to the left and make it blue and continue skipping one cell to the left and making it blue until you reach the leftmost cell or there are no cells left. The rest of the cells should remain black. This has to be repeated for all rows.\\\\n26. To make the output, you have to replace the last row blue cell with a checkerboard pattern starting with a blue cell. The pattern rotates to the right each row going upwards.\\\\n27. To convert the input to output, you replicate and spread the blue dot diagonally and alternatively from the leftmost column to the rightmost column, creating a zigzag pattern. Start from the cell containing the blue dot in the input grid and move diagonally up to its left (if a valid cell exists), paint the cell blue and then move diagonally up to its right to paint that cell blue, continue this pattern until you reach the top. Then, move down diagonally to the right first and then to the left alternately till you reach the bottom. Continue this zig-zag pattern till the rightmost column. All other remaining cells should be painted black.\\\\n28. To make the output, you have to take the bottom line with the non-black color and rotate it 90 degrees counterclockwise. This counterclockwise rotation is then replicated on every single row above following the same pattern of color distribution. Note that these rotations are relative, they are not fixed onto the origin of the grid but rather move with respect to each row.\\\\n29. To transform the input into the output, color the cells in a checkerboard pattern.  If the number of rows and columns is even, color the first cell on the first row blue and continue with the checkerboard pattern, else if the number of rows and columns is odd or number of rows is even and columns are odd, color the last cell in the first row blue and continue with the checkerboard pattern. In case where number of rows are odd and columns are even, color the first cell of the first row blue and continue with the pattern.\\\\n30. To make the output, you have to shift any colored cells on the bottom row to the right on each subsequent row, looping around to the beginning if it reaches the end. All other positions remain black. If the row is all black then apply this with the blue cell starting on the leftmost position.\\\\n31. To make the output, begin at the last row where the single blue box is left-most, then start to place blue boxes alternating in each cell as you make your way to the right and top of the grid row by row. The blue boxes follow a zigzag pattern where every new row begins in a new cell to the right of the previous row\\\\\\'s starting cell. The pattern then repeats itself when it reaches the end of the row.\\\\n32. To make the output, start from the bottom row, replace the leftmost black square with a blue square. For each row above, shift this blue square one position to the right. If the blue square reaches the rightmost limit of the grid, move it back to the leftmost position on the next row. Repeat this till you reach the top row, creating a shape which bisects the grid diagonally.\\\\n33. To make the output, you have to fill the grid with diagonal stripes of blue and black. Start in the bottom left corner with blue and alternate colors for each cell moving to the right and up. The second cell in the first row, the first cell in the second row, the third cell in the first row, and so on, is blue. All other cells are black. The pattern continues until the entire grid is filled.\\\\n34. To make the output, you have to fill cells with blue and black in a striped pattern from bottom to top, but the direction of the stripe changes as you move from left to right. First column starts from the bottom, second starts from the second bottom, until the last column which should start from the top.\\\\n35. The transformation involves creating a diagonal line of blue pixels from the bottom left corner of the grid to the top right corner. Black pixels are left in place.\\\\n36. To achieve the output, you need to fill the entire output grid with stripes of blue and black squares. Start with a blue square in the bottom-left corner (like the input grid) and fill the grid alternating between black squares to the right and above and blue squares moving diagonally, creating oblique stripes.\\\\n37. To make the output grid, you start from the bottom left corner and move to the right, replacing every other box with a blue box, in a zigzag pattern. Once you reach the end of a row, move one row up and continue the zigzag pattern from right to left, then move one row up again and continue from left to right, and so on, until you fill the entire grid.\\\\n38. To make the output, you have to fill blue squares in a diagonal manner starting from the bottom left corner. The pattern moves in an upward zigzag. If there are more columns, continue the pattern to the right most column, then move upwards again.\\\\n39. To produce the output, you have to \"shuffle\" the blue box in the last row, like you are doing a rotation over each column, column by column, towards the top. The blue color moves one step up, while at the same time the black color moves one step down in a cycle. If it was on the first row it goes to the last one.\\\\n40. To make the output, Move the blue cell, in the last row from left to right in each row, starting from the leftmost position and moving to the right by one cell in each subsequent row. If you are on the last cell on the right and you have to move right, return to the leftmost cell on the next row. The rest of the cells should be black.\\\\n41. The transformation pattern moves in a wave from the bottom left to the top right, changing the black cells to blue while passing through. The pattern inverts (blue to black and black to blue) each time it moves up or to the right. For instance, if the original blue cell is at the bottom left (row 1, column 1), the square moves upwards and right, turning the previously black squares to blue. This pattern continues until the top right corner of the grid is reached. The blocks that have not been crossed by the pattern wave remain black.\\\\n42. To make the output, you have to fill the cells diagonally from bottom left corner to top right corner with blue cells, while the rest of cells should stay black. The blue cells will cycle every width grid cells diagonally. Thus, the grid becomes a pattern of diagonally striped blue and black cells.\\\\n43. To make the output, you have to replace the black cells in a zigzag (snake-like) fashion starting from the bottom left cell with blue cells. The first blue cell is placed in the last cell of the first column, then the blue cells \"snakes\" its way up to the first cell. After reaching the first cell, it continues to the next column but now in a down-up-down-up sequence rather than up-down-up-down in the first column until all available cells are filled. Each column alternates between starting with a blue cell at the bottom or top.\\\\n44. To make the output, you have to add a blue cell to the first column of the upper row, then move diagonally from left to right, placing blue cells and filling the remaining cells with black. Continue this pattern until the bottom row where the blue cell is placed in the first cell as the input. In each row, the placement of the blue cell shifts to the right by one space from the previous row. If the blue cell reaches the right end, it starts again from the leftmost cell in the next row.\\\\n45. To make the output, you have to fill the grid with a diagonal pattern, starting with blue on the bottom left and alternating black and blue every cell up the diagonal. The pattern then starts over at the next cell to the right of the previously started diagonal.\\\\n46. To produce the output, starting from the last row, replace every row\\\\\\'s first cell with a blue cell, and shift this blue cell one cell to the right in every alternate row from bottom to top. There should be a blue cell in every row- if the row is even (counting from the bottom as the first row), the blue cell should be on the leftmost side, if the row is odd, it should be moved to the right one cell per odd number of rows. The spots not filled by the blue cell should be filled with black cells.\\\\n47. To make the output, the blue cell in the input grid needs to be shifted diagonally right and up one cell at a time until it reaches the top right corner. After reaching the top right corner, the blue cell starts moving diagonally left and down. The movement of the blue cell simulates a zigzag pattern diagonally across the grid. When the blue cell reaches the bottom left corner, the pattern restarts and the blue cell moves diagonally right and up again.\\\\n48. In the output grid, the blue square from the last row is like a bouncing ball. It starts moving up and bounces between the borders of the grid in a zig-zag pattern. The direction of the movement alternates between right and left with each bounce. The first move is upward to the right, meaning it moves one position up diagonally towards the right from its starting point. In the following row, it moves upward to the left, meaning it moves one position up and one position to the left. The pattern repeats as it bounces between the right and left border of the grid.\\\\n49. Start from the position of the blue box in the bottom row. Move diagonally up to the right until you reach the top row, then move diagonally up to the left. Repeat this zigzag patter, moving the blue box one step on every move. Fill the other boxes in the same row as the blue box with black.\\\\n50. To make the output, you have to invert the position of the \"1\" and shift it diagonally from the bottom left corner to the top right corner. If the grid is an even number of boxes wide and tall, alternate the blue and black boxes in a checkerboard pattern. If it is an odd number of boxes wide, offset the patterns so that a black box in the corner diagonally from the blue box. It\\\\\\'s like laying a blue and black checkerboard over the grid beginning from the bottom left corner.\\\\n51. To make the output, you have to fill each row of the grid with a repetition of the following pattern: \"blue cell, black cells\". The number of black cells is equal to the number of columns minus one. The position of the blue cell depends on the index i of the row: it is located at the column index i modulo the number of columns. Bottom-left corner has (0,0) as an index and indices of cells increase upwards and to the right.\\\\n52. To make the output, you have to insert blue cells diagonally from bottom-left to top-right in a zigzag or wave pattern with all other cells remaining black. The number of blue cells in each row equals to the width of the grid, and for every alternating row, the position of blue cells moves one space to the right. The starting point of the pattern resets when it reaches the right end of the grid.\\\\n53. To make the output, you have to create a pattern of a blue cell moving rightwards, then upwards, turning the black cells where it has been into blue, and return to the left side when reaching the end of the rows.   Note: This pattern repeats vertically for each row. Start from the bottom-left corner and always move towards the right. When the end of the row is reached, move to the left side of the next row above it, turning the cells that the blue cell has passed into blue, and continue the rightward pattern.\\\\n54. To make the output, you have to follow a diagonal pattern starting from the blue cell in the bottom left corner. Going upwards, the blue cell should move one step to the right in each row while the rest of the cells in the row should remain black. The pattern affects all the cells of each row, up to the top.\\\\n55. To make the output, you have to count the number of columns from left to right and starting from the bottom right, fill in blue cells in a zigzag pattern up to the top. Then, repeat for the next column to the left until you reach the leftmost column. The number of zigzag rows is equal to the number of columns.\\\\n56. To form the output grid, a diagonal pattern of blue squares is created that begins from the blue square location from the bottom row in the input grid. The blue squares continue diagonally upward alternating with black squares until the top row in the output grid is reached. All other squares in the output grid are black.\\\\n57. To create the output from the input, start at the last row with the blue cell. Moving up one row at a time, replace every black cell with a blue cell in the next column from the right. If the blue cell reaches the last column, move it back to the first column in the next row. Repeat this action until you reach the first row.\\\\n58. To make the output, you have to  duplicate the blue cell in a zig zag pattern starting from the bottom of the grid to the top. The blue cell first moves to the right, then upwards, then to the left, then upwards again, repeating this pattern until it reaches the top of the grid.\\\\n59. To create the output grid, start from the bottom row where there is a blue cell. Alternate blue and black cells upwards, moving from left to right, row by row. In each row, if the previous color was blue, the current cell color should be black, and if the previous color was black the current color should be blue. If a row ends with blue, start the next row with black and vice versa.\\\\n60. To make the output, you place the blue cell in a zig-zag pattern starting from the bottom left corner moving to the right then up to the second row from the right to the left, then up to the third row from left to right and so on until you reach the top of the grid.\\\\n61. To obtain the output, first, find the position of the blue cell in the bottom row (if we represent the row by an array, its index). Secondly, from bottom to top, alternate the position of the blue square between the position of the original blue square and the first position available to the left. This will create a diagonal pattern moving upwards.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "Category 1: Zigzag pattern starting from the bottom left corner\nRule: To make the output, you have to place a blue pixel in a zigzag pattern starting from the bottom left corner and going up.

To make the output, you have to move all gray squares towards the pair of red squares (if they are in the same row or column). The gray square should stop once it is adjacent to a red square or they reach the middle of the grid. If there is no red square in its path, the gray square should move to the center of the grid.\\\\n2. To transform the grid, look at the red squares on the grid. After spotting a red square, move directly to the right and place a gray shape at the first available empty spot. If there\\\\\\'s no free position to the right side of the red square within the same row, start from the leftmost cell on the same row and proceed to the right until you find an empty spot to place the orange square. Thus, in every row that has a red square, there is a corresponding gray square placed in the rightmost empty cell on the same row. If there is no empty cell to the right of the red square(s), the fuchsia square is placed in the leftmost cell on the same row. The transformation is to move gray shapes in the direction of the row based on the location of red squares.\\\\n3. To make the output, move each grey square towards the red squares\\\\\\' cluster . If there\\\\\\'s only one red square, move the grey square towards that red square.  Next, for every cell that a grey item moves through, color that cell grey (5), too. All other colors and spaces should remain the same.\\\\n4. To make the output, move the gray square to the closest black cell in the direction of the red squares. When there is a red square, move the closest gray square (if there is any) to the black cell adjacent to the red square such that the gray square is closer to the center of the grid.\\\\n5.

Movement is done towards the left if grey box(es) is/are found on right of red cluster and vice versa. Position of red cluster is fixed and doesn\\\\\\'t move.\\\\n6.

So, each gray cell will always be aligned with the center of the closest red square(2x2).\\\\n7. To transform the grid, for every grey square at position (x,y) in the input grid, place a grey square in the output grid at positions (x-1, y), (x+1, y), (x, y-1) and (x, y+1), unless it will overwrite a red square.\\\\n8. To make the output, you have to consider the red groups as objects. The nearest gray square to each red object will be moved to the right side of the red object. If multiple gray squares have the same nearest distance to a red object, all will be moved to the right side. The rest of the squares retain their color and position.\\\\n9.

If there\\\\\\'s no red square in a direction then move the grey square to the edge of the grid in that direction.\\\\n13. To make the output, you have to shift the grey dots towards the nearest red square (if present in the same row or column) until they become adjacent to the red square. If no red square is present in the same row or column, the grey dots remain fixed.\\\\n14. To create the output, locate the grey boxes and the line of red boxes in the input grid. You have to mirror the position of the gray boxes on the vertical axis and now its all in line with the red boxes. Move the box on top of the line of red boxes, if there is no red box on top of its position, just leave it where it is. If there is a grey box for every red box, then you stack the grey boxes on top of each other, maintaining their order on top of the red box.\\\\n15. To create the output, move each of the grey boxes to the nearest red square. If there are two equally nearest red squares, move the grey box to the red square on its left. If there\\\\\\'s no red square on its left, move it to the red square on its right. The red squares remain in their initial positions.\\\\n16. To make the output, you have to look at the position of the red square in the input grid which is located at the top left corner of the red square. Then, move all the grey cells to be below the red square on the same column, spanning all the empty rows. Grey cells that were originally in rows above the red square should be moved to the top of the column of grey cells. If there was no grey cell in the original row of the red square, a new grey cell should be added in its place. The red square remains the same. The remaining cells are empty or black.\\\\n17. To get the output grid, the grey squares move one step to the left side. When a grey square meets a blue square, it jumps over it and continues to move left. The grey squares continue left until they meet a border or another grey square.\\\\n18. To make the output, you have to find positions of the blue square, the grey square, and the red rectangle. The initial position of the blue square is copied to all positions specified by the grey square and the red rectangle. The grey square and the red rectangle themselves remain unchanged in the output. All other black points remain the same.\\\\n19. The transformation consists of two steps. Move each fuschia square in the input grid one step towards the right. If it encounter a red square on the way, it passes through and place itself at next available cell. This implies if a fuschia square hits the right boundary, it will appears at the beginning of the row, leaving black cell behind.\\\\n20. To make the output, you have to find the 2x2 red squares and assign one grey square above them, you also move another grey square to the right side of the red 2x2 square. All the grey squares on the grid with black cells in between them and the red 2x2 square are shifted downward. All other squares remain unchanged in the output.\\\\n21. To make the output, you have to move the grey lines one grid closer to the red tiles. Do this regardless of the grey line position. If a grey line is on the red tiles, it does not move. If there is no red tile on the grey line\\\\\\'s path, the grey line does not move.\\\\n22. To make the output, you have to move each grey pixel to rightmost position of its row if that position is not within or to right side of two red pixels. The red pixels do not move. If there are two grey cells on the same row, only the left most cell will move to the right most position while the other will remain unmoved.   If a row has both grey and red cells such as the case in the fourth row of Case 1 where there is a grey cell on the second column from left side and two red cells in the middle, the grey cell will not move to the right of red cells, but it will situate itself to left side of the left most red cell.\\\\n23. To make the output, you have to move the gray cells to occupy the positions in the center column that are aligned with the pair of red cells in their respective rows. If the same row contains more than one gray cell, they should all be moved to the central column. Black cells should fill in the rest of the grid.\\\\n24. To make the output, you have to move each gray cell to the row which has red cells. If there are multiple rows with red cells, move the gray cell to the first row counted from top to bottom. If there are already other gray cells in that row, place it on the right side of them. If there is no red cell in the input, leave the grid unchanged.\\\\n25. To make the output, you have to move the gray \"5\"s towards the red \"2\"s. Move the \"5\" from Top-Right to Left of the \"2\"s, move the \"5\" from Top to Top of the \"2\"s and move the \"5\" from Left to Right of the \"2\"s.\\\\n26. To make the output, you have to shift the gray boxes closer to the center red boxes. The end result should be that there is a grey box on the end of each pair of red boxes, and an additional gray box in the middle of the grid (directly underneath the red boxes). Also, remove the gray box furthest from the center.\\\\n27. To make the output, place the yellow squares in the middle between the two red squares if they are arranged horizontally, or place the yellow square on the right of the top red square if the red squares are arranged vertically. If a yellow square doesn\\\\\\'t have any nearby red squares, move it to the nearest cell above but within its own column.\\\\n28. To make the output, you find the horizontal row with the red cells. You should move each grey cell three steps towards this row. If a grey cell is already on this row, leave it where it is. If a cell moves onto a cell with a grey cell already in it, both cells should be kept.\\\\n29. To make the output, you have to move the grey squares to a position directly right of the red squares. If there is no red square on the same row, the grey square should move to the center of the grid.\\\\n30. To make the output, keep the blue dots in the same place if there\\\\\\'s no grey dot near them. Move grey dots in the row/column that contains blue dots to positions right before blue dots in the respective column/row if a grey dot is found. If multiple grey dots are in the same column/row of blue dots, place them all right before blue dots, with the same order they have relative to each other in the input grid.\\\\n31. To make the output, you have to move each grey square to a position between the pair of red squares, specifically in the center or the position closer to the left. If there are multiple occurrences of the red square pair and grey square, do the operation independently for each of them.\\\\n32. To make the output, you have to shift the grey square to the closest red square in either horizontal or vertical direction. If there are more than one red squares in the same direction, shift the grey square towards the nearest one. If the grey square is already adjacent to a red square, keep it in its place.\\\\n33. To transform the grid, you need to follow these steps:   - Identify the column where at least one red square is present. - Shift all the red squares to the right within the boundaries of the existing red box.  - Move the grey box to the middle column of the red box. - If red squares are already in the last columns of their respective boxes, then no transformation is required. And the output will remain the same as the input.\\\\n34. To achieve the output, move every grey cell (depicting the number 5) one step towards the red cell/s if there exist any on the same row. If more than one grey cell exists, move each accordingly toward the red cell/s. If no red cell exists in the row, the grey cell remains in its original place. The rest of the cells should remain black in the output.\\\\n35. To make the output, you have to move the grey dots towards the middle which is two steps from their original position towards the red square. The grey dots cannot go into the red square, they should stop before the red square. If there are two grey dots on the same row or same column, they should both move towards the middle, but they should not overlap with each other, they should stop one step before the other grey dot.\\\\n36. The grey color (5) in the output is shifted to center taking the red color (2) in input as reference. All other color blocks including red and black remain as in the input.\\\\n37. To make the output, you have to find all of the grey points and connect them sequentially to the nearest red square, if no red square is closest to the grey point then connect it with the other grey points forming a pathway with a grey dot at each center of boundary crossed. Remember that the red squares should remain untouched.\\\\n38. To make the output, you have to move the grey dot two places to the right from its position in the input grid. If this position is occupied by a red colored square, then the grey dot moves to the top of the red square. If there is already a grey dot on the top of the red square, then it is moved upwards until it is placed in a cell which doesn\\\\\\'t already have a grey dot. Move the grey dots in the given order: top to bottom and left to right (as reading in English). The red squares doesn\\\\\\'t move.\\\\n39. To make the output, you have to move the grey squares so they surround the group of red squares. Move each grey square down one row. If the grey square is in the first column, move it to the last column of the row above. If the grey square is in the last column, move it to the first column of the row below.\\\\n40. To produce the output, move each grey cell in the input so that it is horizontally adjacent to its closest pair of red cells. To be specific: find the pair of red cells that is closest (vertically) to a grey cell and place the grey cell on the same horizontal level as the red pair, retaining the column position. If there are two pairs of red cells that are equally close to a grey cell, place the grey cell in between the two pairs of red cells.\\\\n41. To make the output, you must move the grey squares to be adjacent to the red square on the three sides that do not touch the edge of the grid. If the red square is adjacent to a corner, only two grey squares will be able to be placed.\\\\n42. To make the output, you have to move the grey cells. The first grey cell should move down until it is in line with the red square. The second grey cell should move right until it is on the right edge of the red square. The third grey cell should move up until it is in line with the red square. All other cells should remain the same.\\\\n43. To create the output grid: If there\\\\\\'s a grey square located to the right of the red squares, move it to the middle of red squares. If there\\\\\\'s a grey square either located above or below the red squares, move it to the right of the red squares. If there\\\\\\'s a grey square located on the left side of the red squares, move it downward until it is in the same row as the red squares and place it on their right. If there\\\\\\'s a grey square located somewhere else in the grid, remove it.\\\\n44. To form the output, the rule is to shift the blue square to the midpoint of the red squares in each pattern. Should the red squares be positioned vertically, the blue square moves to the center vertically. If the red squares are positioned horizontally, the blue square moves to the center horizontally.\\\\n45. The transformation involves moving the grey squares to specific locations.   Step 1: Find the red square pair. If the red square pair is located vertically, move the grey square directly below the bottom red square. If the red squares are located horizontally, place the grey square to the immediate right of the rightmost red square.  Step 2: If there is a grey square in the top row, move it to the third row in the same column. If there is a grey square in the first column, move it to the fourth column.  Step 3: If there is only one grey square in the grid, place a grey square in the center of the red square pair and the original grey square.\\\\n46. To make the output, you have to move each blue dot to the closest red square. If a blue dot is at the same distance from two or more squares, then it should be duplicated to each square. After this transformation, remove the original blue dots from their positions at the input grid.\\\\n47. To make the output, you have to move each of the grey 5s so they are 1 step away from one side of the closest blue square (the 2s). If there\\\\\\'s no blue square available, the \"5\"s remain at its position.\\\\n48. The transformation rule involves moving the grey cells next to the red cells. The grey cell closest to the red line is moved to be adjacent to the line in the direction that the red line is pointing. For example, if the red line is horizontal, the grey cell is moved to the right to be adjacent to the red line. If there are no red cells, the grey cells remain in the same position.\\\\n49. To make the output you have to shift all grey cells towards the center, onto the red cells, while remaining on their original axis. If more than one grey cell falls on the same target red cell, then the additional ones should continue along that direction until it hits a wall.\\\\n50. To make the output, you have to move the grey squares to the next position where there is a blue square in the same row. If there is no next blue square in that row, remove the grey square. If there is more than one grey square in a row, move them in the order from left to right.\\\\n51. To make the output, you have to move the grey dot in the line of the red pair between them. If more than one grey dot is mirroring along the line with the reds, all of the mirroring grey dots should be moved between the red pair.\\\\n52. To make the output, you have to locate the grey cells and shift them following this rule:  - if grey cell is on some distance from red cells,     then move the grey cells towards the red cells and stop at the cell closest to the red cells.    (Basically think of the red cells as attracting the grey cells towards them.) - if there are no red cells on the grey path then the grey cell doesn\\\\\\'t move.  The rest remains unchanged.\\\\n53. To make the output grid, you have to identify the ones which are grey and create a grey path from its location to the nearest pair of red boxes. The path should preferably move horizontally first, and then vertically, but it should ensure that it is the shortest path to reach the red boxes. The rest of the boxes remain black.\\\\n54. To make the output, you have to shift the solo grey squares. If there is a cluster of red squares on the right, shift the grey square to the left. And if the cluster of red squares is on the left, shift the grey square to the right. If there is a cluster of red squares both on the left and right, move the grey square to the middle.\\\\n55. The transformation is done by moving each isolated grey cell in such a way that it is surrounded by either blue cells or other grey cells. Specifically, each grey cell is moved to the left-most open cell in the row containing the two blue cells. If a row does not have two blue cells, move the grey cell to the row above or below that has two blue cells. If the grey cell is already among blue cells, leave it in its place.\\\\n56. To make the output, you have to re-arrange the grey square. The grey square should be moved to the center (or near center) of the grid, in line with any red squares in the same column or row. If there are multiple red squares in the same column or row, the grey square should be placed in line with the red square that is furthest from the center. If there are several options for where the grey square can be placed, it should be placed in the spot closest to the top of the grid. If there are no red squares in line with the grey square, it should be left in its original position.\\\\n57. To make the output, you have to place a grey cell in between every two red cells, if they are adjacent, either horizontally or vertically. The grey cells that are not adjacent to two red cells remain in place.\\\\n58. To make the output, you have to fill in the blue squares to the right of the red squares(in the same row). Imagine that any square that is directly to the right of a red square (in the same row) and is on a blue square or a black square(not if the blue square is part of a blue pair) is painted blue. The rest of the transformations are copied directly from the input.\\\\n59. To generate the output grid, you should pass a grey square down through each column until it either hits a red square or the bottom of the grid. If the grey square encounters a red square in its column, it halts immediately above the red square. If there are multiple grey squares in a single column, they move in the order they appear, from top to bottom.\\\\n60. To achieve the output, you have to move the grey squares leftwards towards the red squares by following this rule: The first grey square (from the top) goes in the space to the right of the top red square. The second grey square goes in the space to the right of the second red square and so forth. If a red square doesn\u2019t have a space to the right, the grey square goes to the left of this square. If there\\\\\\'s no red square in the column, the grey square stays in its position.\\\\n61. To make the output grid, you have to identify all the lines drawn with grey (5) squares. After finding the line, the square which is located in the middle of the each grey line should be moved towards its left by one box. If there are red (2) squares in the next box where the grey square should move, then the grey square is replaced with the red squares there. This transformation affects only the grey squares forming a line and not any stand-alone grey squares. Therefore, single gray squares which are not part of a line remain in their initial position.\\\\n62. To make the output, you have to move all purple squares to the next space on their right, wrapping around from the end of a row to the beginning of the same row. If the purple square is on a red square, it should be moved, but the red square stays in its location.\\\\n63. The pattern involves moving the grey square to the right side of every red pair of square. If the grey square is already on the right of a red pair, it remains in its position. If there is no red pair to its left, it moves to the leftmost position.\\\\n64. To make the output, take the position of the grey cells and shift them accordingly:  1. If the cell is to the left of the red square, shift the cell one step towards right. 2. If the cell is to the right of the red square, shift the cell one step towards left. 3. If the cell is above the red square, shift the cell one step downwards. 4. If the cell is below the red square, shift the cell one step upwards.   Keep the red square of cells and the black cells as it is.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "After analyzing the rules, they can be categorized into eight distinct categories based on their similarities:\n\nCategory 1: Rules involving movement of grey squares towards red squares or clusters.\nCategory 2: Rules involving movement of grey squares towards the center of the grid.\nCategory 3: Rules involving movement of grey squares in relation to other colored squares.\nCategory 4: Rules involving movement of grey squares to specific positions in relation to red squares.\nCategory 5: Rules involving movement of grey squares in relation to their own positions.\nCategory 6: Rules involving movement of grey squares to create specific patterns.\nCategory 7: Rules involving movement of grey squares based on the presence of other grey squares.\nCategory 8: Rules involving movement of grey squares based on the presence of other colored squares.\n\nSynthesized rules for each category:\n\n1.

To make the output, you have to change all the red cells within the frame to blue. If there is a red cell within the frame, it should remain red in the output and divide the blue cells within the frame into different sections.\\\\n2. To achieve the output from the input, the technique is to change the color of the interior spaces of the red shapes to blue. The border of the red shapes and any single red (lonely) cells maintain their color, along with the black cells that make up the rest of the background grid.\\\\n3. To make the output, you have to change the color of all the black cells that are completely enclosed within the red cells to blue while the other cells remain the same as in the input.\\\\n4. To make the output, you have to substitute the interior of the circle, or zero, from red to blue leaving the boundary of the circle red only.\\\\n5. To get the output, you have to replace the black cells that are completely surrounded by red cells with a blue cell. If black cells are at the edges (horizontal and vertical line) remain as it. But if they are covered by red cells from top, down and sideways, then they become blue cells.\\\\n6. To make the output, you have to check all the black boxes in the input grid. If a black box is completely surrounded by red boxes, change its color to blue in the output grid. Otherwise, leave it as a black box. All red boxes remain the same color in the output grid.\\\\n7. To make the output grid, you replace some of the empty black squares situated in the interior of the cross formed by red squares in the input grid with blue squares. The blue squares are placed in such a way that they make a smaller cross inside the red cross, leaving a one square frame of red around them. If the black squares in the red cross are adjacent to any red squares from all four directions - top, bottom, left, and right - then they become blue.

To obtain the output grid from the input grid, all the center cells of the shapes formed by the red cells that are completely enclosed by red cells have to be turned blue. Any shapes that are not enclosed on all sides by red cells remain red. In other words, any red cell that is surrounded on all four sides (up, down, left, right) by red cells should be turned blue.

To make the output, you have to keep the shape of 2, but replace the black boxes inside of the shape with the color blue (represented by the number 1).

Keeping the other cells unchanged.\\\\n44. To make the output, you have to paint all the black cells enclosed by red lines into blue, except for the black cells that touch red end points diagonally or orthogonally.\\\\n45. To make the output, blue color is added within the red forms present in the input grid. This blue color takes the interior of the red shape leaving only the outermost squares in red. In case a square in the middle of the form is red it remains as is while the squares surrounding it turn blue.\\\\n46.

The outer cells of each shape remain the same color.\\\\n54. To make the output, only the inner cells of the red colored shape are changed, leaving the border intact. Inside the shape (excluding the border), any clusters of black colored cells that are completely surrounded by red should be turned to blue (number 1). All other cells remain as they are.\\\\n55. To make the output, you have to fill space enclosed by red boxes with blue (1). If there is a red (2) pixel inside the shape, it stays as it is. The rest of the grid remains unchanged.\\\\n56. To make the output, you maintain the red structure, but change the color of the smaller shapes enclosed within the red structure to blue. Any red box directly touching a black box on at least one side remains red. Boxes that are completely surrounded by red boxes turn blue.\\\\n57. The transformation pattern involves replacing all the inside black cells (0) framed within the red cells (2) with blue cells (1), while leaving all the previously red cells (2) and the rest of black cells (0) unchanged. The pattern also preserves asymmetry: if the red frame is unsymmetric, the blue fill inside follows that shape without creating any reflection symmetry.\\\\n58. The transformation from the input grid to the output grid involves changing the interior of every outlined shape created by the red color or number 2 into blue or number 1, while keeping its border as red or number 2. However, a single isolated cell of red or 2 inside the outline remains red or 2.\\\\n59. To make the output, the internal pattern of black cells enclosed by red cells needs to be replaced. The boundary remains as red cells. The cells in the middle are replaced by blue cells where they were black in the input, with the exception of the one cell that was red in the input, which remains red in the output grid. Therefore, in the output grid, the black cells in the input that are enclosed by the red cells have been changed to blue, while the central red cell remains unchanged.\\\\n60.

To make the output, you have to change all the black cells which are entirely surrounded by the red cells in the inner shape to blue. The red cells that are surrounded by other red cells remain red, and the black cells that are not entirely surrounded by the red cells or are part of the outer border stay black.\\\\n64. To make the output, you have to keep all the positions and colors of the grid identical, but for the spaces enclosed by the red squares, replace the black squares with blue squares but make sure that the space enclosed has one red square in it and it retains its position. If the space enclosed by red squares does not have any red square inside it, change all the black squares to blue.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "After analyzing the rules, they can be categorized into eight distinct categories based on their similarities.

For each category, synthesize the rules into a single, specific rule that combines the ideas of all rules in that category, while clearly differentiating it from the other categories.\\\\nThe new rule should be as specific as possible, following the format of the given rules.\\\\nThe new rule should be applicable without any information from the original rules - i.e. it should be standalone.\\\\n\\\\nRules:\\\\n1. To make the output, you have to color the cells above the red cells as follows: - The row directly above the red cells, make the cells green. - The rows above the green cells, continue the green cells diagonally left for each row until you reach the first column. When you reach the first column, continue the filling of green horizontally until you reach a black cell.   In the rows directly under the red cells, fill the cells with blue consecutively from left until a black cell is encountered. Repeat this process until you reach the row before the next red cells or the last row of the grid. The rest of the grid cells remain black.\\\\n2. To make the output, you have to keep the row of red squares as is and create a gradient of decreasing sized blocks of blue and gray squares on top of it. Each block is one square shorter than the one below it. The last block of blue squares only has one row, and the rest of the squares above it are black.\\\\n3. To make the output, start from the row that contains the red cells and move upwards. Replace the red cells with green cells. Create a gradient of blue cells above the red/green row, with the number of blue cells in each column decreasing by one as you approach the top, and fill the remaining cells with black. Below the red/green row, create a similar gradient but with fewer blue cells, changing to grey near the bottom before filling up the rest of the grid with black cells.   In summary, the first row of the gradient should contain as many colored cells as there are in the red row (excluding black cells), with each subsequent row containing one less colored cell until the top of the grid is reached. The same occurs below the red row but with one less colored cell in each subsequent row until the bottom of the grid is reached.\\\\n4. To make the output, you have to create a triangle pointing down with its peak starts from the bottom of the first red box. The color of the peak of the triangle should be blue, which counts up from the row beneath the red boxes, for every row it fills until it hits another red square or the border. The rest of the triangle should be green, which fills until it hits a red square, or the border. The unfilled space remains black.\\\\n5. To make the output, you have to perform the following actions: 1. Any consecutive red columns from the left should remain the same. 2. For any set of contiguous black cells above the red cells, fill them in the downward diagonally right direction with teal cells. 3. For any set of contiguous black cells below the red cells, fill them in the upward diagonally right direction with blue cells. 4. The remaining black cells should remain as they are.   So the transformation involves coloring cells diagonally on top and below the red cells until we run out of cells in that diagonal.\\\\n6. To make the output, you have to fill the block diagonally from top left to bottom right. The number of blocks in each diagonal line should be the same as the number of red blocks on the row in the input grid. Fill the blocks diagonally downwards with first green, then blue, and then with black for the remaining blocks.\\\\n7. The transformation is as follows: The sequence of red cells in the input grid, beginning at the leftmost column and extending to the right, remains unchanged in the output grid. Above this sequence, for each black cell in the input that is to the right of the last red cell in the same row, transform it into a green cell in the output. Below the sequence, for each column that has a green cell, fill downwards with blue cells until the row that contains red cells is reached. All remaining black cells stay the same.\\\\n8. From the column of red cells, start to move upwards and to the right, replacing the black cells you encounter with blue cells. Once you reach the corner, you do the same but with yellow cells. You stop when you reach a row that has already been filled with blue or yellow cells. For each row in the output, the first yellow square should be in a later position than in the row above.\\\\n9. The rule for transformation from input to output is based on a progression which starts from the red line (2) upwards. In the row immediately above the red line, we need to paint a blue line (cell is 1), and above this line, a green line (cell is 3). This transformation is continued until it hits the topmost point where there is red color in the grid. Black cells that do not follow this rule remain black. The length of the red, blue, and green rows depends on the length of the red input line, reducing by one cell as it goes upwards.\\\\n10. To make the output, you have to simulate a falling effect for the red line, where each part after the first, will follows the one before it as they move towards the bottom, until they reach it. Simultaneously, a green line should be coming from the top, filling the gap left by the red line as it falls. When there\\\\\\'s no more gaps to fill by the green line, it should be replaced by a blue line with the same behavior.\\\\n11. To make the output, you have to  perform the following steps:  1. Make a mirror image of the red staircase above the original one, but made out of green cells instead of red ones. 2. Create a small stairs of blue cell below the red stairs, each step clearer than the other. 3. Finally, fill the remaining cells with black.\\\\n12. To make the output, you have to keep the red squares in the same row as in the input grid. Then, starting from the row above the red squares, insert a row of green squares that stops one square before the red squares. Repeat this process with the blue squares above the green squares, each time stopping one square earlier than the previous row. Leave all other squares as black.\\\\n13. To make the output, You have to duplicate the line where the red squares appear, and after duplicating it, replace the red squares with blue ones without changing their position. After duplicating, start adding blue squares to the line above (if it exists) from the left to the right until you reach the last column where the red square was located. Finally, you replace any remaining black squares in rows that contain blue squares with grey squares. In the line above the lines of blue squares, you replace only the cells where blue squares appear below them with a blue square, leaving the rest black cells. Repeatedly following this pattern upwards, will create a cascade of blue and gray squares that have a semblance of a diagonal gradient.\\\\n14. To obtain the output from the input, you have to mirror the red squares within the same row with green squares. Retain the red squares in their original positions. After that, fill in squares below the red and green squares with blue but stop filling a row once encountering a red square. Make sure to keep filling in the remaining squares below the blue squares with blue in all subsequent lines. You should retain the black squares where no red, green or blue squares have been put.\\\\n15. To transform the input into the output, three colors of squares are introduced: red, blue, and green. The original line of red squares remains in the final grid. Above this line is a sequence of green squares that starts at the top left extending diagonally down to right, the number of green squares on each horizontal line decreases by one in each subsequent row downwards, starting with the total number of red squares in the original line. Below the red line, a line of blue squares appears with a similar pattern to the green squares, just in the opposite direction (increasing by one with each row downwards). The black squares remain the same.\\\\n16. To make the output, you have to fill above red cells with green cells in a diagonal line from left to right, continue until the green cells touch the boundary. Apply a similar pattern below the red cells, but use blue cells instead. The red horizontal line remains the same. Leave the other cells as black.\\\\n17. To get the output, a blue square should be placed in every square that is above and to the left of the red squares (excluding the diagonal). Place two more blue squares in the squares immediately below and right of the just placed blue squares (also excluding the diagonal). The diagonal itself should be a grey square followed by a series of blue squares equal to the number of red squares in the input minus one, then a series of black squares equal to the number of blue squares plus one. Finally, the lower right triangle below the diagonal should remain black.\\\\n18. The transformation happens exclusively in the left top triangle of the grid. Yellow numbers are added in a sweeping motion from the left top corner towards the red line in the shape of a reversed right triangle. In the row before the line of red numbers, the numbers are filled with blue. The rest of the grid remains black.   So, the specific rule is: Starting from the upper left, keep adding yellow until you reach the same row as the red line, then start the next line but stop one cell early, repeat this pattern until you reach the line directly above the red line where you fill the row with blue instead of yellow. The red line is not changed in the output, and the rest of the grid stays black.\\\\n19. To make the output, you have to consider the position of the red square in the input grid. From this row upwards, create a pyramid-like pattern where the level above the red boxes is filled with a single row of blue boxes, the level above it is filled with two rows of green boxes, and the level above it is filled with three rows of green boxes, and so on until there\\\\\\'s no more space. The rest of the squares and those under the red ones remain black.\\\\n20. To make the output, you have to replace all red squares with blue squares, then fill in the squares above this blue diagonal with green squares, decreasing one by one moving up from the diagonal. Below the blue diagonal, fill in the squares with yellow squares decreasing in number from the diagonal towards the bottom.\\\\n21. To make the output, you have to fill the red squares with the corresponding color according to the number of black squares to the right of it, starting from the right side. The square immediately next to a black square will be filled with blue, and the subsequent squares will be filled with green, depending on the amounts of black squares to the right. The squares to the left of a colored square remain as they are.\\\\n22. To make the output, you have to create a new sequence from the top converging to the red line. From top to bottom, this sequence contains alternating rows of teal and blue the same length as the red line with an incrementally decreasing number of cells in the row until the red. After the red, continue with blue reducing cells until only black cells.\\\\n23. To transform the input into the output, first imagine a similarly sized green square to the red one, but shifted downward by one square and rightward by the number of squares equivalent to the side length of the red square. Secondly, imagine a similarly sized blue square shifted downward by two squares and rightward by the number of squares equivalent to twice the side length of the red square. Replace the red squares with green and the green squares with blue. The spaces where the red and green squares overlap are kept as red. The remaining cells on the grid are left black.\\\\n24. To make the output, you have to perform a transformation based on the position of the red cells in the input. If a red cell is found, preserve that row and then fill previous rows with green cells, starting from the edges inward. After the line of red cells, fill the subsequent cells with blue color, moving from edges towards the center.\\\\n25. To create the output grid, use the line of red squares as a marker. All rows above this line should be filled with green squares with the quantity decreasing by one for every row towards the top until there is one green square in a row. The row directly beneath the line of red squares should be filled with blue squares with the quantity decreasing by one for every row towards the bottom until there is one blue square in a row. All other squares should be left black.\\\\n26. To make the output, you have to copy the horizontal row with colored cells as is. Above this row, for each row fill the cells with one less green box than the row below until you fill as many as the number of red boxes in the original row. In the first row above the copied red row, create one blue box, starting from the first cell in the left. In the subsequent rows, keep adding one more blue box from left, until you reach the number of red boxes. Fill the rest of the cells with black boxes. Any row below the copied row should become completely black.\\\\n27. The transformation works by spreading the red color upwards (rows above the line of red boxes) and downwards (rows beneath the line of red boxes) until it reaches a boundary. The red color spreads upward as green color and downward as blue color. Within each row, the green or blue colored boxes stay on the left-most side, filling up the spaces from left to right. The horizontal line of red remains red. All remaining areas are kept black.\\\\n28. To make the output, keep the red horizontal line in the same place as in the input. Above it, draw green squares in the mirror image of the red squares. Below it, draw blue squares that decrease in number by one for every unit of distance from the red line.   This transformation leaves empty squares below the blue ones and above the green ones. The rightmost blue and green squares align vertically with the rightmost red square. The diagonal from the top-left of the grid to the bottom-right is always empty.\\\\n29. To make the output, you have to follow these rules. On the line with the red boxes, copy them as they are in the output. On the lines above, count the number of red boxes on the line below and draw a number of green boxes equal to the number of red boxes below minus one. Add the blue boxes by counting the number of red boxes two lines below and draw a number of blue boxes equal to the number of red boxes two lines below minus one. Continue to fill the line with black boxes until the end.\\\\n30. To make the output, start from the row containing red squares in the input. Above this, in the output, create a series of rows with a decreasing repeating pattern of green squares. Each new row decreases the number of green squares by one from the left side, replacing them with blank squares. The output row that corresponds to the input\\\\\\'s red one should contain the same pattern. Below this red squares row, there\\\\\\'s a pattern of blue squares with the same logic of decreasing number of squares, but this time from the right side.\\\\n31. To make the output, you have to fill squares in a descending diagonal pattern according to the dimensions of the small filled red square from input. The pattern should start with the green at the top right of grid, right above the existing red square and then filling diagonally. The green pattern then transitions to a blue pattern starting at the same point and ending one row further. The blue pattern then transitions to a red pattern starting at the same point and going fully downwards.\\\\n32. To make the output, you have to follow these steps: place the line of red blocks at the same location as in the input. Above it, fill each row with green blocks until it reaches the length of the red blocks on the row below. On the row above the first row of green blocks, place blue blocks until it reaches a length one unit less than the greens. Continue to place blue blocks, decreasing the length by one for each successive row, until you have a single blue block. Fill the rest of the grid with black blocks.\\\\n33. To make the output, you have to add a green arrow pointing towards the right above the red blocks, and below the green arrow create a blue arrow, pointing to the right as well, that reaches one cell less to the right than the green one. Keep all these colored arrows one cell above each other and there shouldn\\\\\\'t be any space in the arrow. The end of all colored arrows is filled with black cells. And if there is no red block, just draw a black cell.\\\\n34. To make the output, you have to replace the top row of red squares with a line of green squares. The green squares should start on the far left, then move one square to the right in each subsequent row, until there\\\\\\'s only one green square at the right end. The row immediately below the red line should contain the same pattern of blue squares. The rest of the grid should remain black.\\\\n35. To generate the output grid, mirror the location of the red line, with green cells placed on the right hand side of red cells for the same amount as the red cells in the row above, and add blue cells in a reverse stair pattern for every red cell in the row below. For any empty cells, leave as black.\\\\n36. To make the output, the red squares stay as it is, the row above the red squares is turned into green squares until it hits the position where the red squares begin in the input. The row below the row with the red squares is turned into blue squares, again until it hits the position where the red squares begin in the input. This pattern continues alternating between blue and black squares in every row below the red squares. All remaining cells stay black.\\\\n37. To make the output, you have to first keep the row with red boxes intact in the output. Then, starting from the row immediately above the red boxes, fill the left half (rounded up if the length of the row is odd) of the row with green boxes and do the same for the following rows upwards. The number of green boxes in a row should decrease by 1 for each row upwards until it becomes 0. After the row of red boxes, do the same with the blue boxes for the rows downwards, also decreasing the number of blue boxes by 1 for each row downwards until it becomes 0. Any remaining boxes in the output should be black.\\\\n38. To make the output, you have to look for the set of red blocks in the input. Retain these red blocks at the same positions in the output. Then, starting from the row right above the line of red blocks, fill with green blocks going upward and leaving the rightmost block empty in each row until you reach the top. Start filling the rows with blue blocks from the row below the line of red blocks, going downward and leaving the rightmost block empty in each row until you reach the bottom.\\\\n39. To make the output, you must \"pull\" the red line upwards, filling in the grid above them with green and blue. Start by placing a green row directly above the red line, replace the next row upwards with one less green cell and one more black cell, so on and so forth, until there is only one green cell left, after which you place a line of blue cells in a similar fashion until there is only one blue cell left. If there are any rows still left above the rows filled with green and blue cells, they should be filled with black cells. The remaining part of the grid below the red line should be filled with black cells.\\\\n40. The transformation involves a mirror reflection of all red squares and the ones directly above them. Specifically, each red square remains as it is. However, for each red square, you need to add a blue square directly above it and then a grey square over the blue square, continuing this pattern until you hit the top of the grid. If there is a row of multiple red squares, this pattern applies to each of the red squares in the row.\\\\n41. To make the output, you need to draw a diagonal pattern starting from the left corner of the red row. The diagonal pattern is formed by horizontal lines of green boxes to the right of the red boxes, orange boxes to the right of the green boxes, and black boxes in remaining space. The number of green and orange boxes decreases from top to bottom, forming a diagonal pattern. The red boxes remain the same.\\\\n42. In the output grid, beneath the red line, fill an equal number of boxes with blue, starting from left to right. Then above the location where the red line ends, fill remaining boxes with green, from right to left. The rest cells contain same elements from the input grid. The transformations proceed a row at a time from bottom to top.\\\\n43. To make the output, you have to first copy over the row with red units from the input to the same place in the output. Then make a gradient above that row going upwards: the first row above the red has green units in each square where format was a red square in the row below, and then blue units above the row of green units. This continues until the top of the grid, with each row having one fewer units from left to right than the row below. The rest of the cells remain black.\\\\n44. To make the output, you have to replicate the line of red blocks diagonally upward to the right. The new lines should be of decreasing length by one block, with the color being green. The last, shortest line should be blue. Fill the remaining blocks with zeros.\\\\n45. The transformation involves creating diagonals of blue squares and a diagonal of orange squares leading up to the first red square in the line, and diagonals of blue squares continuing after the last red square.  Here are the detailed steps to perform the transformation: - From the position of the first red square from the left in the input, create a diagonal of blue squares from the top-left of the grid down to that first red square. - Replace the diagonal of black squares above the red line in the input with a diagonal of orange squares in the output. The diagonal should start from a location exactly one position above and to the right of the first red square in the input, and continue up and to the right until it hits the top edge of the grid. - From the position of the last red square from the left in the input, continue the diagonal of blue squares from that red square down to the bottom edge of the grid. - Replace all the black squares with the color in the initial input grid. The red line remains unchanged.\\\\n46. To make the output, you should keep the original red squares at the same positions, above them in the top left corner starting with the first row till where the red square lies, convert the remaining black squares of that row into green, then from the next row, convert additional black square into blue each row until only one blue square remain, the rest should be black.\\\\n47. The transformation involves replacing the black cells on the rows above the red cells with green cells and the rows below with blue cells. The number of green and blue cells is determined by the position of the last red cell on the row above and below respectively. On the row with red cells, the positions of black cells on the right of the red cells remain as they are. The cells to the left are replaced with more red cells, the number of which is determined by the position of the first red cell on that row.\\\\n48. Starting from the row with red squares, place blue squares on the rows above by repeating the same number of blue squares corresponding to the number of red squares. Then add a row of grey squares and then yellow squares above the blue square rows. Keep the remaining rows the same as the input grid. The pattern should reduce in size as you go upwards.\\\\n49. Transformation begins with the row that contains the red cells. That row remains unchanged. The cells of the next row up are colored grey, represented by the number 1. This process extends further up with the cells of each subsequent row being colored green and increasingly having one less cell colored starting from the right until only one cell (at the far left) is colored. The remainder of the cells to the right in each of these rows is left black. Rows below the row with the red cells are left black, and no transformation is applied.\\\\n50. To make the output, follow these steps.  Step 1: Wherever there is red in the input (value 2), keep it red in the output. Step 2: In rows above this red line, fill in with green (value 3) beginning from the left side, until you match the size of the red line. The number of green cells will be one less in each successive row above the red line. Step 3: In rows below this red line, fill in with blue (value 1), starting from the left side. The number of blue cells will decrease by one in each successive row, leaving the last line of blue with only one cell. Step 4: The rest of the cells remain black (value 0).\\\\n51. The transformation starts with the row of red color from the input, and ends with the top row of the output. The red color is preserved in its position. Above the red row, the grid is filled up with green pixels. The number of green pixels in each column equals the number of red pixels below it in the same column, plus one. Below the red row, the grid is filled up with blue pixels. The number of blue pixels in each column equals the number of red pixels above it in the same column, plus one. Black color is used to fill up the remaining grid.\\\\n52. To make the output, you have to reflect the row of red squares above it but in blue color. Each square of the row corresponds to a square in the reflection. If a square in the row is red, then the corresponding square in the reflection is blue; if a square in the row is black, then squares in the reflection decrease their number by one from blue to grey, ending in black. Note that the row of red squares and its reflection do not overlap.\\\\n53. In the output grid, the red row in the input grid becomes a row of orange cells (3\\\\\\'s) above the red row and for each orange cell, there should be a blue cell (1\\\\\\'s) under the red row. The number of orange and blue cells decrease successively from the left end until there are no more. The rest cells should be black.\\\\n54. To make the output, you have to replace the row above the red row by the number \"3\", starting from the left edge in the same number of columns occupied by red, then continue to the next row upward by replacing by the number \"1\", but reducing by one on the right edge for every subsequent row until \"1\" occupies one column or until it reaches the edge of the grid, if the rows end before reaching one column. By applying this pattern, you fill the grid above the row with red cells.\\\\n55. To make the output, you have to keep the red ones as red. Then, above the red line, the squares should be filled with green but with a gradient from the right - the green should get to black just before the red line. Below the red line, the squares should be filled with blue but in a similar way, the blue should get to black a few squares behind the red line.\\\\n56. To make the output, you have to replace each consecutive row above the one with red squares with progressively smaller amounts of green squares. Above the row with green squares, use blue squares, reducing the number by one in each row until you reach a single blue square in a row. The cells that haven\\\\\\'t been replaced remain black.\\\\n57. To make the output, you have to add a fading line of green and blue squares above the red line in the input. The green line starts from the row above the red line and goes upwards in a diagonal shape. The green line ends when there is no more space left on the grid. For the blue line, it starts from the row where the green line ends, and continues upwards until there is no more space on the grid. The fading effect is achieved by reducing the length of each line by one box as we move upwards.\\\\n58. To make the output, you must start from the line of red and \"mirror\" it above with one less red block at the right most end and replace the missing red block with a dark blue one. On the third row (counting only ones with colours), replace the red with a dark blue, then do the same \"mirroring\" process with the first two rows but with gray replacing the missing red. Below the red line, replace red with grey and continue \"mirroring\" with less gray every row.\\\\n59. To make the output, you have to identify the row that contains the contiguous red squares. Then, starting from the top row to the one identified (excluding), fill each subsequent row following the pattern: one row of green squares (the same length as the red squares in the identified row) decreasing in length by 1 for each row; followed by one row of blue squares (starting 1 less than the red squares and decreasing by 1 for each row) for the remaining rows till the row with the red squares is reached. All remaining squares in the grid are left black.\\\\n60. To transform into the required output grid, you need to count the red squares (value 2), starting from top left corner, in your horizontal line and replace them with incrementally smaller green squares (value 3). Starting from top of the line where the red squares exist, mark n green squares(row-wise), where n is the number of red squares. Do this until you run out of red squares to replace with green squares. After that, continue the same process in the next rows with blue squares (value 1) until the number of blue squares equal the number of red squares. Leave the rest as empty.\\\\n61. To make the output, you have to keep the red line on the same spot. Then, starting from the red line upwards fill the cells with green as far as the red goes, using the horizontal axis as symmetry. Symmetrically from the red line downwards, fill the cells with blue as far as the line above the red goes, using the horizontal axis as the axis of symmetry. Leave all other squares black.\\\\n62. To create the output from the input, start with the shape and position of the red line from the input grid. Then, create a blue line of rectangles along the row above the red line, extending right from the left edge of the grid to a point one cell less than the red line on the right. Repeat this process above the blue line using orange rectangles, with the orange line being one cell shorter than the blue line. Continue these steps, alternating between blue and orange, the line of rectangles being one cell shorter each time, until you reach the top of the grid. Any remaining grid cells stay black.\\\\n63. For the output, first, create a section of blue squares directly above the red section in the input grid. The number of squares in the blue section should be one less than in the red section, and the first square should be positioned one square to the right of the first red square. Continue this \\\\\\'inversely staggered\\\\\\' pattern upwards with a green section above the blue section, punctuated with blue rows, until you reach the top of the grid. Then, create a section of grey squares directly below the red section. The grey section should have two less squares than the red section, and the first square should be positioned one square to the left of the first red square. Continue the staggered pattern downward with grey sections, until you reach the bottom of the grid.\\\\n64. To make the output, you first need to identify the line of red squares in the input. From this line, increase the height of the red region upwards. Then, for each row, you need to make the red boxes turn green starting on the right side and continue leftward until you meet a red square. Then lastly, beneath the original red line, you should draw a blue line that is one square high and is as wide as the red line. The rest of the grid should be filled with black squares. The green squares essentially form a triangle shape that points to the right. The blue squares forms a line beneath the red squares.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "After analyzing the rules, they can be categorized into eight distinct categories based on their similarities.

To transform the input into the output, locate each blue dot on the input grid. If there are consecutive blue dots on the same row, convert every other spot after the first spot into a red dot. The blue and red dots should alternate. All other spots remain the same as they are in the input.\\\\n2. Set the value of each blue cell to 1 if it is the first blue cell in its row (moving from left to right), and 2 if it is the second, and alternate these values for any subsequent blue cells in the same row. Leave the black cells as they are. This effectively transforms lines of blue cells into alternating lines of blue and red cells.\\\\n3. To form the output grid, you look at the adjacent cells in each row of the input grid. Whenever you observe that a blue cell (number 1) is followed by another blue cell, replace the second blue cell in the output grid with a red cell (number 2). All other cells remain the same. This process works from left to right within each row.\\\\n4. To make the output, you have to identify each blue dot in the input, if the dot is followed by another blue dot to the right of it, then in the output grid, mark that following dot as red disregarding the dots that do not meet this condition. In other words, if there is any blue square that is directly to the right of another blue square, change the right blue square to red in the output.\\\\n5.

If a blue square is standing alone on a row, it remains as a blue square.  For example, if from left to right, you have blue squares at positions 2, 4, and 6 on a row, then the squares at positions 2 and 6 would be changed to red. The square at position 4 would remain blue.\\\\n7. To make the output, you have to loop through each line in the grid and if there are multiple consecutive blue cells, change every second one in the sequence to red starting from the second blue cell. Leave all other cells unchanged.\\\\n8. To make the output, you have to find the rows or columns that have blue squares. Then, starting from the second blue square of a row or column and moving forward, turn all the blue squares into red squares while leaving the first blue square intact. Keep the black squares the same.\\\\n9. To turn the input grid to the output grid, you start with the first blue box in each line and keep it the same. For consecutive blue boxes in the same line, they should be incremented by one. Keep incrementing until you reach a black box, then start over with blue for the next blue box. The color scale is as follows: 1:blue; 2:red. Black boxes remain unchanged. The incrementing stops and resets to blue once a black box is encountered before a new line of blue boxes.\\\\n10. To make the output, you need to find the blue patterns in rows. Each subsequent blue cell within a pattern from left to right, needs to be marked with the next number in sequence starting from 1. The sequence resets when a black cell interrupts a blue pattern.\\\\n11. To make the output, you have to look at each row with blue squares. For each consecutive pair of blue squares with only black in between, turn the black square into a red square. Leave all other squares the same.\\\\n12. To make the output, you have to replace the blue cell that comes after another blue cell with a red cell while leaving every other cell unchanged. The transformation considers the grid horizontally.\\\\n13. To make the output, you have to change the consecutive blue cells in rows to a pattern of blue and red cells. The first blue cell remains, but the second blue cell changes to red, and so on alternates to form a wave pattern. The red color represents number 2.\\\\n14. To make the output, you have to change every second blue cell to a red cell. You should start counting from the first blue cell in each row so the second, fourth, sixth, etc., blue cell should be colored red in the output. We only capture the transition from blue to red in the horizontal rows, vertical columns and other patterns are not considered.\\\\n15. To make the output, you need to change every second blue cell in a horizontal line to red, while leaving the black and the rest of the blue cells unchanged.\\\\n16. To make the output, you have to add an additional red square for each contiguous set of blue squares in the input from left to right. The red square will appear after the first blue square in each set and the rest of the sequence from left to right remains blue. All black squares remains black.\\\\n17. To make the output, you have to make the second blue point in a row or column into a red point, while the rest of the spots remain blue. All black points remain black. This action mirrors the counting of blue points in rows and columns, where the second count is replaced by red.\\\\n18. To transform the grid, focus on the horizontal rows of blue in the grid. Wherever there is a pattern of two blue shapes with a black space between them, replace the second one with a red shape in the output grid. All other areas remain the same.\\\\n19. To make output, you would need to identify the blue lines in the input. They could be arranged vertically or horizontally, from one point of the grid to another or they could just be isolated points. The blue lines are sequences of blue cells (cell color corresponds to the \\\\\\'1\\\\\\'), surrounded by black cells (cell color corresponds to the \\\\\\'0\\\\\\'). For each sequence of blue cells, the second in order cell turns red (cell color corresponds to the \\\\\\'2\\\\\\'), while leaving the first and final ones blue. If there is only one blue cell alone, it remains blue. Therefore, the transformation from the input grid to the output grid is to change the second cell of every continuous blue line to red.\\\\n20. To make the output, you have to change each blue stripe pattern of two consecutive blues followed by zero or more blacks to a blue, red, and the same number of blacks.\\\\n21. To make the output, replace all second occurrences of blue boxes in each row or column with red. The rest of the pattern remains unchanged. So, if the blue boxes appear once in a row or column, they stay the same; if the blue boxes appear twice or more, the second occurrence becomes red.\\\\n22. To make the output, you have to change every second blue cell in a line to red. Start counting from the first blue cell in each line, continue counting if the line is broken by black cells but do not skip the black cells in count. If there\\\\\\'s only one blue cell, leave it as is.\\\\n23. To make the output, replace every second blue cell in horizontal and vertical lines with a red cell. The sequence of the colored cells (blue, red) should be repeated for every line with colored cells in the input grid. Keep the black cells unchanged.\\\\n24. To make the output, you have to replace the second blue square in a series with a red square. This means every second instance of a blue square in each row is replaced by a red square. The pattern resets with each row.\\\\n25. To make the output, you have to check each blue cell (value 1) in the input grid. If it has a neighboring blue cell to its right or below, then change its value into red (value 2) in the corresponding cell in the output grid. If not, then keep it blue. Keep the black cells (value 0) the same in the output.\\\\n26. To make the output, you have to consider each row individually. If a blue square has another blue square to its right in the row, change the right blue square to a red square. If there is no blue square to the right, leave the original blue square unchanged.\\\\n27. To make the output, you have to keep all the black cells the same and look at each row individually. If a given blue cell is directly followed by another blue cell on the right side, change the color of the following blue cell to red. The rest of the blue cells remain the same.\\\\n28. To make the output, you have to change the 1s on the input to sequence of 1s and 2s on the output. More specifically, every second blue square (starting from the first) in each sequence is replaced with a red square. All other elements remain the same.\\\\n29. To make the output, you have to change every second 1 in each group into 2. Other numbers in the grid remain the same. The counting should be restarted for each new group of 1s.\\\\n30. For the blue squares on the input grid, count how many successive blue squares there are in sequence for every row and replace every second blue square in an uninterrupted sequence with a red square. The first blue square in the sequence remains blue. Repeated sequences on the same row start with a blue square.\\\\n31. To make the output, you have to identify every second blue cell in each line and make it red, counting from the first in each direction. The remaining cells stay the same.\\\\n32. To make the output, you have to transform the patterns of blue stripes. If there are alternate cells of blue (with black cells between them) across rows or columns, then every second blue cell from the first blue cell should remain blue, but every alternating one in between should be changed to red. The rest of the grid remains unchanged.\\\\n33. Change blue (1) cells in the input that are next to other blue cells to red (2) in the output, but only if the blue cell is to the right of the other blue cell.\\\\n34. The transformation rule is that every consecutive blue square within the same row increases in intensity on right-ward progression (the number \\\\\\'1\\\\\\' represents blue, and \\\\\\'2\\\\\\' represents red). This is done by changing the value from 1 to 2 for every alternate blue square from left to right, while the others remain as 1. All black squares (\\\\\\'0\\\\\\') remain same.\\\\n35. To make the output, replace every second blue square in a row with a red square (2), starting with the second blue square. Leave all other elements as they are.\\\\n36. To make the output, you have to change every second blue square in a row into a red square. Start counting from the first blue square in every row.\\\\n37. To make the output, you have to change every second blue cell in each consecutive line of blue cells to red. The count restarts for each new line of blue cells.\\\\n38. To transform from the input grid to output grid, for every sequence of blue cells in a row, each blue cell needs to be alternated with a red cell. If there is only one blue cell, it remains a blue cell, if there are two, the first one remains a blue cell and the second one becomes a red cell. This pattern alternates for any further blue cells in the sequence.\\\\n39. To make the output, you have to alter only the blue lines from the input. The pattern employs a switch in color across the contiguous blue lines. Starting with blue (1), the color alternates between red (2) and blue (1) for each cell in the blue lines. The direction of the alteration does not matter as the pattern is applicable both left to right, and top to bottom.\\\\n40. To make the output, you have to replace the second consecutive blue dot in a row with a red dot. If there is a third consecutive blue dot in a row, it should also be replaced with a red dot. All other blue dots remain unchanged.\\\\n41. To make the output, you need to look out for consecutive strings of blue pixels in the input grid. If a blue pixel (1) is followed by another blue pixel, change the following blue pixel to red (2). For instance, a sequence \"1 0 1\" remains the same but a sequence \"1 1\" should become \"1 2\" in the output. Keep the rest of the grid the same as in the input.\\\\n42. To make the output, you have to identify the horizontal lines of blue cells. Transform every second blue cell in these lines to a red cell, starting from the first blue cell. All other cells remain unchanged.\\\\n43. To make the output, transform the pattern in each row that contains blue squares. Keep the first blue square, replace the second blue square with a red square, the third blue square with a blue square, the fourth with a red square, and so on. Each row is treated independently.\\\\n44. To make the output, the blue squares are marked 1 in the pattern and the black squares immediately to the right of the blue ones turn red (2) instead of their original black (0). Every other black cell remains the same.\\\\n45. To make the output, you have to replace each blue cell that has a blue neighbor on the right side with a red cell. If a blue cell does not have a blue neighbor on the right side, it remains blue in the output. All black cells remain black.\\\\n46. To make the output, you have to observe the sequence of blue boxes in each row of the input grid. Every second blue box in a sequence has to be changed to red in the output grid. The first blue box in a sequence gets to stay blue while the rest of the grid remains the same.\\\\n47. To make the output, you must alternate between blue and red color in lines of blue in the input grid. Start with blue (color 1) and on the second occurrence of blue in the same line change it to red (color 2), on the third occurrence of blue in the same line change it back to blue and continue in this manner.\\\\n48. To make the output, you have to replace every second blue square in each row where blue squares appear by a red square. The first blue square in the sequence remains blue, the second should turn red, the third remains blue, the fourth turns red, and so on. This pattern resets with each row. All black squares stay black.\\\\n49. To make the output, you have to paint the cell red if it\\\\\\'s directly between two blue cells horizontally. Everything else should remain the same.\\\\n50. To make the output, you have to change the blue cells based on their position. If a blue cell is surrounded directly (in horizontally or vertically) by two other blue cells, then the cell should remain blue in the output. But if a blue cell is surrounded directly by only one other blue cell (whether located at the top, bottom, left, or right side of it), it should change its color to red in the output. If a blue cell is isolated (it does not have any other blue cell near it), it remains blue in the output.\\\\n51. If a cell in the input grid is blue, change its color to red if the blue cell has another blue cell immediately to its right. Otherwise, leave it as blue. Leave all black cells unchanged.\\\\n52. To transform the input into the output, replace the second blue cell in any row segment of blue cells surrounded by black cells with red, and keep all other values same.\\\\n53. To make the output, you have to locate the blue squares within the black grid. If a blue square is found, replace the next black square to its right with a red square, unless the next square is already blue. In such a case, the pattern should start over with a blue square after it. This should be done for each row individually.\\\\n54. To make the output, you have to change every second blue cell in an alternated black and blue row to red, starting from the second blue cell in the sequence. Leave the black cells unchanged. Rows that have no colored cells should remain the same.\\\\n55. To make the output, you have to focus on the rows with blue cells. Change every alternating blue cell starting from the second blue cell in these rows to red cells. Rest of the cells in the grid remain the same.\\\\n56. The pattern here transforms the grid by replacing every second blue cell in a series of consecutive blue cells with a red cell. The first blue cell in a consecutive series of blue cells remains as is, and every second blue cell after it is turned red. Black cells remain as is.\\\\n57. To make the output, you have to look for sequences of blue cells along the horizontal lines. When you find two or more adjacent blue cells, you should keep the first blue cell as it is, and change all the following adjacent blue cells to red, until a black cell or the end of the row is reached. All other cells should remain unchanged.\\\\n58. To create the output from the input, locate consecutive blue cells in the same row. Mark the first blue cell from the left as blue (1), and the second consecutive blue cell as red (2), and if there still consecutive blue cells mark them as blue again, repeating this pattern as long as the line of blue cells continues. Leave black cells unchanged.\\\\n59. To make the output, you have to increase the number by 1 (from blue to red) in every occurrence of blue boxes that follows another blue box on the same line. Keep the rest of boxes as it is.\\\\n60. To generate the output, you have to observe alternating instances of the number \"1\" (blue cells) in every row and each pair of ones in a row is transformed into a \"1 and 2\" pair. The relative positions of 1 and 2 within the pair correspond to their original positions (i.e., if the \"1\" is in the right within the pair, the \"2\" will replace the left \"1\" and vice versa). All the other cells (with number \"0\") remain unchanged.\\\\n61. To make the output, you have to progress through the grid left to right along each row. If a blue cell (1) is followed by a black cell (0) which is then followed by another blue cell (1), change the black cell (0) between the two blue cells to a red cell (2).\\\\n62. To transform the grid, look for consecutive blue cells in a row. If there is another blue cell one column to the right of a blue cell, turn the neighboring blue cell to red. Keep the rest the same color as before. This turns consecutive blue cells into a pattern of blue and red cells.\\\\n63. To obtain the output, you need to replace every second blue number (beginning from the left in each row) with a red number, maintaining the original sequence of the pattern. All other elements and patterns remain unchanged.\\\\n64. To create the output grid, keep all black cells and blue cells in their original positions. In the rows where the blue cell-black cell pattern mentioned above is observed, change every other blue cell to red starting with the second occurrence of the blue cell in the row.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "Category 1: Rules that involve changing every second blue cell in a row to red, starting from the first blue cell.

For each category, synthesize the rules into a single, specific rule that combines the ideas of all rules in that category, while clearly differentiating it from the other categories.\\\\nThe new rule should be as specific as possible, following the format of the given rules.\\\\nThe new rule should be applicable without any information from the original rules - i.e. it should be standalone.\\\\n\\\\nRules:\\\\n1. To make the output, you retain the original diagonal line, but also reflect it around the center point of the grid. The reflected points create a second diagonal line running downwards and rightwards. In cases where there was a secondary number along the original line, the secondary number is now placed along both diagonals at the point of origin.\\\\n2. To make the output, you have to mirror the diagonal line created by the colored blocks along the center of the grid. The sequence of gray blocks doesn\\\\\\'t influence the output.\\\\n3. The key to transforming the grid resides on the symmetry around its central row/column. The transformation corresponds to mirroring the elements with respect to the center, copying the cell from (i, j) (0-indexed from top left) to the cell (j, i). For example, the value in position (1,2) in input will be in position (2,1) in output. But when an input cell appears twice, the same cell value appears twice in the output grid.\\\\n4. To make the output, we examine the longest diagonal, regardless of the color. If we find a colored cell in the maximum length diagonal, we preserve it and create a symmetric copy on the opposite half of the grid. Conversely, the diagonal in the second half of the grid will be mirrored to the first half. If the cell in the longest diagonal is black, we don\\\\\\'t include it.   Any grey cells will not affect the transformation, nor be mirrored, and they will turn black in the output.\\\\n5. The pattern is centered around a line of color at or near the center row. In the output grid, the other instances of the color are arranged symmetrically to the colored line along the main diagonal. Hence, the behavior is to mirror the position of colored squares (other than black) along the center diagonal of a 10x10 grid.\\\\n6. To create the output, mirror the colored points forming the diagonal in the top left side across the center vertical line. Maintain the color of each point. Any extra colored squares should mirror the initial position about the middle horizontal axis and the color should also be maintained.\\\\n7. The diagonal line in the output grid is mirrored across the center line of the grid. The cells above and below the main diagonal are swapped, creating a mirrored image. The main diagonal remains unchanged. This forms a sort of \"X\" or cross pattern where the center of the cross is the same cell as in the input.\\\\n8. To make the output, you have to create a mirror image of the diagonal line of colored cells on the diagonally opposite side of the grid. First, keep the original diagonal line of colored cells. Then, for each colored cell on the diagonal line, add a mirror image of it diagonally opposite where the line would be if it continued to the edge of the grid. If there are additional colored cells around the diagonal line in the input, they are not included in the output. The remainder of the output grid is black.\\\\n9. To make the output, you have to flip the diagonal line with colors vertically. If there\\\\\\'s a triangle in the input, flip those in a vertical direction as well. Every colored cell in the upper triangle of the grid (cells where the row number is less than the column number) is mapped to the cell symmetric to the main diagonal (the cell with the same row and column number), and every colored cell in the lower triangle (cells where the row number is bigger than the column number) is also mapped to the cell symmetric to the main diagonal. The cells on the main diagonal remain unchanged.\\\\n10. To make the output, keep the original diagonal line of colored cells intact. However, for each grey cell in the original grid, project it to the left to match the original colored cell\\\\\\'s horizontal position and down to match the original colored cell\\\\\\'s vertical position. Fill the cell in the resulting grid where these projections intersect with the color of the original colored cell.\\\\n11. The transformation operation for the output involves mirroring the diagonal line of colored number cells from the input grid along the central vertical axis. That means copying every colored cell and its color to the symmetric position with respect to the center of the grid. After doing this, previous cells keep the same values, so mesh cells can be both the original and mirrored ones.\\\\n12. To make the output, you have to reflect the diagonal line of colored boxes about the middle line of the grid. This means that the leftmost colored box will now be on the rightmost side of its row, and similarly for the other colored boxes. The gray boxes, if present in the input grid, are not reflected and remain in their original location.\\\\n13. To make the output, you have to mirror the colored diagonal vertically through the center of the grid, while keeping the original diagonal. So each diagonal colored number appears twice - once on the original place, and once mirrored. The gray squares (number 5) are ignored and treated as black squares in the transformation.\\\\n14. The pattern involves flipping the diagonal and matrix along the vertical centre. The grey spots in the original grid however remains in the same places.\\\\n15. To make the output, you have to keep the colored cells where their row equals their column (i.e the main diagonal), then mirror the colored cells on the secondary diagonal which extends from the top right corner to the bottom left corner. For example, if you have a cell on the 3rd row and 5th column, you should put a colored cell on the output grid on the 5th row, 3rd column. Grey cells, if present, are ignored and not mirrored. The color of the cells stays the same. You should keep the rest of the cells black.\\\\n16. To make the output from the input, mirror the colored lines running diagonally from the top left to bottom right and from top right to bottom left. If there is a line of other colors they stay at the same position but form a diagonal that runs from top right to bottom left and then gets mirrored again to run from top left to bottom right to form a V or inverted V shape in the output depending on the initial position of diagonals.\\\\n17. To make the output, you have to mirror the diagonal line across the center of the grid. Any gray boxes should also be mirrored and end up on the opposite side of the line.\\\\n18. To make the output, you need to mirror the diagonal line horizontally, you should still see the colored line diagonally from the top-left to the bottom-right corner but have an additional line from the top-right to the bottom-left corner. The colored pixel that is now both on the line from the top-left to the bottom-right corner and the line from the top-right to the bottom-left corner is the pixel where the 2x2 grey square was on the input.\\\\n19. To get the output, turn the diagonal line of the input from vertical to horizontal, centering it in the middle row. If there is grey color below the diagonal in the input, make the mirror image of the newly formed horizontal line at the center and color it with the color of the original diagonal line from the input.\\\\n20. To make the output, you have to reflect the diagonal line over the vertical central line of the grid. If there are grey squares blocking this reflection, simply overwrite them with the reflected orange squares. The rest of the grid should remain untouched and black.\\\\n21. To make the output, you have to reflect all the colored boxes over the vertical center line while leaving all the black boxes unchanged. The top left cell moves to the top right, the next cell down moves to the second cell from the right at the top, and so on. If a cell is intersected by two different colors, take the color that is closer to the top left when reflected.\\\\n22. To make the output, you have to reflect the input grid with colors (either orange, brown, or red) diagonally from the top-right corner to the bottom-left corner. This transformation does not affect the grey column, if any. The grey numbers or diagonal line in the middle of the original grid is reflected at the center of the new grid.\\\\n23. To transform the grid, for the first pattern, place an orange on each side of the diagonal of oranges, but filled in with greys in between. The second pattern follows the same sort of rule, but with browns on either side of a diagonal of greys. If any browns or greys are present in the original positions from the input, replace them with greys. The third pattern follows the similar rule but the transformation is mirrored compared to the first and second pattern.\\\\n24. To make the output, you have to take the orange diagonal and place a mirrored version of it to the left of the original diagonal. If there are any grey cells to the right of the initial orange diagonal, leave them as they are.\\\\n25. To make the output, you have to reflect the input grid across the vertical axis (i.e., performing a vertical flip), move the orange color a step behind and maintaining the semi-circle of grey but replacing the blue with black.\\\\n26. To make the output, we mirror the colored blocks along the diagonal line going from the top right corner to the bottom left. The colored block that was previously to the left of the diagonal line will now be to the right of it and vise-versa. Keep in mind that the diagonal remains the same.\\\\n27. To make the output, you have to create a reflection of the input grid across the vertical center line. The orange and gray diagonal lines should be mirrored.\\\\n28. To make the output, you flip the image along the main diagonal. So the orange line that was in the upper left to lower right in the input now goes from lower left to upper right in the output. The brown line (when it appears) that was in the upper right and runs towards the middle in the input is now in the lower right running towards the middle in the output. The grey segments also get flipped with the orange line.\\\\n29. To make the output, you have to make the orange line lookup like a mirror reflection along center vertically. Specifically, wherever there is an orange number in the input grid, place the same orange number in the same row but mirrored onto the other side of the midline of the grid. If a grey line is present in the input, replicate this in the output by placing the grey number in the middle column. If a green line is present in the input, do not replicate this in the output. Keep all other squares black.\\\\n30. To make the output, you have to reflect the diagonal line and any additional colorful rectangles along the vertical center line of the grid. Black spaces remain the same.\\\\n31. The transformation reflects the colored boxes (diagonal lines) over the central horizontal axis. The horizontal line of colored boxes in the middle are unchanged.\\\\n32. The transformation requires flipping the grid along the center vertical axis. Following this, identify the initial square line color in the transformed input and replace accordingly with the same color in the output grid. The transformation could also be described as a reflection through the Y-axis.\\\\n33. To make the output, you have to reflect each dot diagonally along the central vertical line. If a dot is in the fifth column from the right, it remains in its position. For rows where two colored dots are present, the rightmost one stays where it is while the left one is reflected.\\\\n34. To transform the input grid to the output grid, reflect all of the colored dots about the center of the grid. The center of the grid is located at the midpoint of the main diagonal, which runs from the top left corner to the bottom right corner. Flip all dots that are not on the center.\\\\n35. To make the output, you have to generate an additional diagonal of colored cells starting from the top middle cell and going down to the bottom middle cell. If a colored cell is already in the diagonal path or the middle path, consider that position filled and continue with the next one in the diagonal or middle, respectively. If the center of the grid contains grey cells, continue drawing the second diagonal as if they weren\\\\\\'t there.\\\\n36. To transform, you need to move diagonally from top left to bottom right filling the grid with orange blocks until you encounter a grey block. After encountering grey block, continue filling the same diagonal with grey blocks. This should form two diagonals with grey blocks above and orange blocks below. Transform grey blocks into black blocks for the final output. Ignore any spaces which do not influence the formation of the diagonals.\\\\n37. To make the output, you must identify the diagonal line of colored cells in the input and create a mirrored diagonal line on the other side of the grid. If there are grey cells in the input, these should be ignored in the output.\\\\n38. To make the output grid, you mirror the upper left color sequence of the input grid in respect to the ascending central diagonal of the output grid, so you keep all the colors and their order but place them in top-to-bottom diagonal form. For grids with a grey sequence, it disappears in the output, replaced by extending the colored sequence in mirror form as explained before.\\\\n39. To make the output, you should make a copy of the diagonal line of numbers in each row, but place it symmetrical to the original line on the left side of the grid. For rows containing two different numbers forming a dual diagonal line, copy the first diagonal line of the second number and place it on the left side of the grid. Replace any left over cells with 0\u2019s to match the size of the input grid.\\\\n40. To transform the input grid into the output grid, flip the non-zero numbers along the vertical center line of the grid. The non-zero numbers that were in the left half of the input grid should now be in the right half of the output grid, and vice versa. The numbers from the input grid which were on the vertical center line of the grid should remain in the same position in the output grid. The remaining cells (those that were zero in the input grid) should also remain zero in the output grid.\\\\n41. To make the output, you have to maintain the placement of the colored marbles in the input but mirror them around the middle of the grid. So a colored dot at position (i,j) where i is the row number and j is the column number, should be mirrored to position (j,i). However, keep the empty cells as they are.\\\\n42. To make the output, you have to mirror the non-black pixels in a top-down diagonal manner. Any non-black pixel should be kept in its position and mirrored along the central diagonal axis of the grid.\\\\n43. To make the output, you have to make the mirror image of the top triangle only across the vertical line passing through the middle of the grid. Keep the color of the cells in the triangle the same as in the input. The rest of the grid remains black.\\\\n44. To transform the input grid to the output, create a mirror image of the colored diagonal on the vertical axis - so the diagonal begins at the center of the top row and ends in the center of the bottom row. Replace any grey squares in the middle with the color of the square that was mirrored.\\\\n45. To make the output, you have to rotate the entire grid around its center (the middle grid cell). The coloured dots, whether placed diagonally or vertically, should end up on the opposite side, still keeping their order of appearance. The gray dots if present, must maintain their position.\\\\n46. To make the output, you have to reflect the diagonal pattern over the horizontal midpoint axis of the grid. All objects positioned above this midpoint axis should be mirrored below it while keeping their original space positions from the diagonal unchanged. However, if there\\\\\\'s a perpendicular line crossing the main diagonal in the input, you will find that it cancels out the mirrored reflections to turn them into black squares. After this process, all colors in the lower triangle (including the diagonal) in the output grid remain the same as the input.\\\\n47. To make the output, you have to replace the color of the squares on the main diagonal with the color of the squares on the intercepted diagonal line if the color exists. If no color exists, the square is left as it is.\\\\n48. To make the output, you have to rotate the whole grid 90 degrees to the right. All orange and grey values will stay in the same relation to each other but mirrored. The grey line goes from the center to the top left corner, then continues as an orange line to the bottom right corner. All black squares should remain black.   The same rotational transformation applies to subsequent cases, regardless of the values in the grid.\\\\n49. To make the output, you have to bend the diagonal line from the middle to run diagonally towards the upper-right corner. Grey cells do not change their position.\\\\n50. You transform the grid by reflecting the original diagonals-of-colour-lines along the center vertical axis of the grid. The positions of the associated gray blocks can be ignored in creating the output. In other words, if a colored (red, brown, or orange) cell is on the left side of the center, it should go to the equivalent position on the right side in the output, and vice versa.\\\\n51. To make the output, you have to take the diagonal line of pixels and create a reflection along the middle (vertical) axis of the grid. Essentially, it\\\\\\'s taking the diagonal line on the left half of the grid and mirroring it onto the right half of the grid. In case of interfering pixels from the middle of the top half, the mirrored pixels will take priority in the output.\\\\n52. To make the output, you have to reflect the colored cells about the central horizontal axis. Maintain the colors of the cells in their original positions. As a result, both diagonals will be colored and all other boxes remain black.\\\\n53. Numbers on a diagonal will remain. Diagonals that have empty spaces in the input grid, in the output these spaces are filled with the value of the number that is on the last square of the diagonal. If the last square of the diagonal is empty, then the squares remain empty. At the intersection of the diagonals, if both are filled, the square will remain empty.\\\\n54. To make the output, you have to adjust the placement of orange blocks (or brown, red in other scenarios) to create a \"mirror image\" of the top half of the grid onto the bottom half. Specifically, each orange square on the top half should be replaced by an orange square in the same position in the bottom half (and vice versa), while maintaining their position horizontally. This effectively folds the diagonal line about the middle row, whilst ignoring the disruption caused by the lines along the middle row.\\\\n55. To transform the input to the output, reflect the orange blocks in the input over the vertical centerline of the grid. The colors remain the same after transformation, and the empty spaces remain empty. Places where grey blocks exist in the input, ignore the grey and treat it as blank space when reflecting.\\\\n56. For the transformation, we first note that the color of the cell on the diagonal line (from top left to bottom right) is the color we focus on. If a completely grey cell is attached to this colored cell on its right or bottom, we move the color of that cell to the centre of the matrix (at position (5,5). For instance, consider that the cell at position (4,4) is colored and grey cells are attached on the right. It results in the cell at position (5,5) attaining the color and thus, moving the entire diagonal line towards the centre.\\\\n57. To make the output, move all colored cells on the diagonal line to the center row. For each cell at position (i,j) on the diagonal, if there are additional colored cells in its row, move them to the same position on the center row. All other cells should remain black.\\\\n58. To make the output, you should mirror each colored cell (non-black) from the first diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) to the second diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) within its same row. The color does not change. All other cells are kept as black.\\\\n59. To convert the input grid to the output grid, mirror the original diagonal on the either side. The grid\\\\\\'s reflected color cells are placed symmetrically on the opposite side of the diagonal. If the diagonal contains another color cell, make them black.\\\\n60. The transformation involves flipping the diagonal line starting from the top left to the diagonal line starting from the top right, maintaining the same color sequence from the top to the bottom. Any other colored lines crossing the diagonal line are not changed; only the location of the main diagonal line is flipped.\\\\n61. To make the output, you have to mirror the diagonal line of colored cells from the top-right corner to the middle of the grid. Same diagonal from the bottom-left corner to the middle of the grid. The diagonal from the middle to the bottom-right remains the same.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "After analyzing the rules, they can be categorized into eight distinct categories based on their similarities:\n\n1.

To make the output, you have to transform the rows containing the red cell to the following pattern: 3-8-0-7-6 and replace the digit at the position of the red cell with the corresponding number from this pattern. Then, place this digit shifted row to the same row in output where red cell was found in the input.\\\\n2. If the red cell is spotted, draw a diagonal line from the top left toward the bottom right of the grid in green, brown, fuschia and teal cells. If the red cell is found on the left side, the diagonal line should start from the top left cell. If the red cell is found on the top side, the diagonal line should end at the top right cell. The order of the cells from left to right, or from top to bottom should be green, brown, fuschia, and teal respectively.\\\\n3. To make the output, you have to find the red square (number 2) in the input grid. It acts as a reference point. In the output grid, replace the cell to the immediate left of the reference point with green (3), the cell two places to the left with brown (6), the cell immediately below the reference point with teal (8), and the cell two places below with orange (7). Keep all other cells the same as the input (black). If the reference point (red) is too close to the edge, start coloring from the top or right side respectively.\\\\n4. To make the output, you have to replace the cell positioned diagonally top left of the red cell in the input with green and the cell next to it with fuchsia in the output. While the cell positioned diagonally bottom right of the red cell should be replaced with teal and the cell next to it with orange in the output. All other cells remain black. If there is no space for two cells diagonally top left or bottom right of the red cell, then no change is made on the cell at the boundary.\\\\n5. To make the output, you have to locate the position of the red pixel in the input grid. Replace this pixel with a black pixel in the output grid. Then, fill the surrounding cells in following way: the cell right to the red pixel is filled with fuschia, the right adjacent cell to this is filled with yellow. The cell below the red pixel is filled with teal, the right adjacent cell to this is filled with orange. All other cells are black.\\\\n6. To make the output, you have to fill the boxes above and below the red box with different colors in a specific order. Above the red box, fill the box with green and the box to the right of it with fuschia. Below the red box, fill the box with teal and the box to the right of it with orange. The rest of the boxes remain black.\\\\n7. To make the output, you have to fill the neighbors of the red box in a specific way. The box right above the red box in the input grid gets transformed to green in the output and the box above this green box becomes teal. The box right below the red box in the input grid gets transformed into fuschia and the box below the fuschia box becomes brown. Similarly, the boxes to the left and to the right of the red box in output are transformed into grey and yellow, respectively. Also, the color of all other boxes is kept black.\\\\n8. To generate the output, you should mark the columns to the left and right of the red square with numbers. The left column should be marked from top to bottom with green, fuschia, and brown squares. The right column should be marked from top to bottom with blue, grey, and teal squares. If the red square is on the border of the grid, the colors should be marked on the opposite end of the grid.\\\\n9. To make the output, you have to replace red box in the input with a black box in output. In the output, the red box is replaced by a green box two positions to the left and a yellow box two positions to the right. If the red box is on an edge, the yellow and green boxes wrap around to the opposite side. If the red box is one position from an edge, the yellow and green boxes stay in bounds but are put in an unexpected location - green to the \\\\\\'right\\\\\\' of the red and yellow to the \\\\\\'left\\\\\\' of it.\\\\n10. To make the output, you have to place three different colors (green, fuschia, and teal) and two base colors (yellow and orange) on the cells adjacent and diagonal to the red cell. The green color always appears in the cell located above the red cell (if any), the fuschia is always to the right of the red cell, the teal is always below the red cell, the yellow is always on the upper right diagonal to the red cell, and orange always appears on the lower right diagonal to the red cell. The remaining cells are left as empty.\\\\n11. Each blue square in the input should be transformed into a pattern in the output. This pattern consists of four squares in the shape of a \"T\" turning clockwise. The \"T\" shape is colored with the following colors: teal (at the top), fuschia (at the right arm of the \"T\"), orange (at the base of the \"T\"), and grey (at the left arm of the \"T\"). The placement of this pattern depends on the position of the blue square in the input: the base of the \"T\" is placed on the same cell as the blue square, and the rest of the pattern extends upwards and to the sides from this cell. Rest of the cells remain black. If the pattern extends beyond the boundaries of the grid, only the part of the pattern within the grid should be painted.\\\\n12. Each red cell from the input triggers a specific pattern in its row on the output. If a red cell is in the first column, it converts into a sequence of green, a blank cell, teal and two blank cells, going from left to right. If a red cell is in the third column, it converts into a sequence of two blank cells, teal, a blank cell, and orange going from left to right. If a red cell is in the fifth column, it converts into a sequence of three blank cells, green, and a blank cell going from right to left in the output grid. The black cells stay the same.\\\\n13. To transform the grid, you need to take every red box and from it extend green, yellow, teal and orange squares upwards, to the right, downwards and to the left respectively. The direction of colors is always clockwise, starting with green, from the red square\\\\\\'s position.   If there is a red square in the position (x, y) change the values in the positions (x-1, y), (x, y+1), (x+1, y) and (x, y-1) to 3 (green), 6 (yellow), 8 (teal) and 7 (orange) respectively. If the red square is in the edge of the grid, ignore the squares that would fall outside of the grid. So, if the red square is on the top row, don\u2019t add green, if it\u2019s in the rightmost column don\u2019t add yellow, if it\\\\\\'s on the bottom row, don\\\\\\'t add teal, and if it\\\\\\'s in the leftmost column, don\\\\\\'t add orange.\\\\n14. To make the output, you have to focus on the cells containing red in the input. For any red cell shifted two cells to the right, there should be two cells between the red cell in the input and the new green cell in the output. A cyan cell will also appear two cells away from the green cell in the right direction, and a brown cell appears two cells to the left from the green cell. If the red cell of the input is on the edge of the grid and it cannot be shifted more than two cells to the left or right, new cells are inserted at the corresponding positions. The original red cell locations of the input will remain black in the output.\\\\n15. To make the output, you have to first find the blue cells in the input grid. Depending on the positioning of the blue cell in the grid, transform the blue cell into black and fill the remaining cells according to the following rules:  - If the blue cell was at the center, fill the cell to the left with green and the cell to the right with teal. - If the blue cell was in the left column, fill the two cells directly above the blackened blue cell with green and yellow respectively, and fill the two cells directly below with teal and orange respectively. - If the blue cell was in the right column, fill the two cells directly above the blackened blue cell with orange and teal respectively, and fill the two cells directly below with yellow and green respectively.\\\\n16. To make the output, you have to imagine a cross shape with the center as the original red position in the input. Replace the original red position with blue, position above with pink, position below with teal, position left with green, position right with yellow. The positions without red in the input remain as black in the output. All these changes take place within the grid, we don\\\\\\'t go out of the grid boundaries.\\\\n17. To make the output, you have to replace a red (2) box with a green (3) box in the cell directly above and replace the boxes to the right of it with orange(7) and fuschia(6), if the cells are available(not out of boundary). If a red box is at the bottom or the top of the grid, then replace the box below or above it with teal(8) and the boxes to the right of it with orange(7) and fuschia(6), if the cells are available(not out of boundary). If a red box is at the right most column then add fuschia box to its left and green (3) box to left of the added fuschia(6) box and teal box above or below the fuschia box depending up on its position. All black(0) boxes remain as black boxes.\\\\n18. To make the output, you have to replace the red cell with a series related to rainbow colors excluding red (3, 6, 8, 7 corresponding to green, fuschia, teal and orange respectively) from the middle row to outward rows. Firstly replace the red cell with green then the other three cells next to the middle one with 6,8,7 respectively to the left and right alternatively starting from left first. If the red cell is in the corner, replace the red cell with green and fill to the right alternatively with 6, 8, 7, else if the red cell is in the right corner, replace the red cell with green and fill to the left alternatively with 6, 8, 7.\\\\n19. To make the output, you need to first identify the position of the red square in the input grid, if there is one. Then, rotate this position 180 degrees within the 5x3 grid. In the output, place a blue square where the red was in the input, a brown square one space to the right of the blue, a teal square one space below the blue, and an orange square one space below and to the right of the blue. If the red square was at the boundaries of the input grid, the squares in the output grid will similarly be positioned at the boundaries. If there was no red square in the input, the output grid should consist entirely of black squares.\\\\n20. To get the output, for every red cell in the input grid, a pattern is formed which fills the cell to its right with teal, the cell two places right with brown, the cell directly below it with green, and the cell two places below it with yellow. If a position in the mentioned pattern falls outside the boundaries of the grid, it is ignored. This means, if the red cell is on the right or the bottom edge of the grid, some of the colours would not appear in the grid as they fall outside the boundary of the grid.\\\\n21. To make the output, imagine where the red spot is on the input grid. The corresponding position on the output grid remains black, and the boxes adjacent to it diagonally are filled in. The top left corner gets teal, the top right gets fuschia, the bottom left gets green, and the bottom right gets yellow.\\\\n22. To make the output, you have to create a mini 2x2 grid within the 5x3 grid. A teal spot will appear opposite to where the red spot was. The green spot will be placed one step to the right and the brown spot will be placed one step to the left of the green spot. The red spot will turn black. If the placement of any color would lands them outside the 5x3 grid, then they remain black.\\\\n23. To make the output, you have to locate red square in the input. Then green square is placed at the cell one space left of the red square\\\\\\'s original position (if exists), yellow square is placed at the cell one space up of the red square\\\\\\'s original position (if exists), teal square is placed at the cell one space right of the red square\\\\\\'s original position (if exist), and lastly pink square is placed at the cell one space below of the red square\\\\\\'s original position (if exists). If there is no space for new square according to rule, no square is placed.\\\\n24. Whenever there\\\\\\'s a blue number (2), replace it with the number 0. Then, starting from left to right, if you encounter a row that had a blue number (2), place the numbers 3, 6 in the upper cell positions right and two right to where the blue number was originally, and the numbers 8, 7 in the lower cell positions right and two right to where the blue number was originally. The positions that hadn\\\\\\'t had a blue number remain black. The transformation moves in a rightward direction from where the initial blue number was.\\\\n25. To make the output, you have to rotate the red cell 90 degrees counter-clockwise around its current location. The original location of the red cell on the input grid turns becomes one of the four corners in a pattern of teal, green, brown, and fuchsia on the output grid. The specific colors and their positions are determined by the new location of the rotated cell. The teal cell takes the position of the original red cell, the brown cell is placed one cell to the right of the original red cell, the green cell is placed one cell above the original red cell, and the fuchsia cell is placed one cell diagonally to the right and above from the original red cell. All other cells remain black.\\\\n26. To make the output, you need to look at the position of the red square (if any) in the input grid. If there is a red square in the input, you must replace the positions symmetric to the red square across one axis with teal, green, grey, and fuchsia squares. This should be done in four configurations corresponding to the four quarters of the grid. If the red square is in the upper left quarter, replace the lower left quarter with a green square and the lower right quarter with a grey square. In the other three quarters, replace the corresponding squares in respective quarters with a teal square and green square for the upper right quarter, a teal square and a fuchsia square for the lower left quarter, and a green square and a white square for the lower right quarter.\\\\n27. To make the output, you have to perform the following steps: As you see the red square, move it two cells to the right (assuming the rightmost boundary is not crossed, if so move it within the grid leaving the rightmost as black) changing its color to green. After this, another red square is placed in the cell right to the initial position. Then, change the colors of two cells to its left: the adjacent cell should be teal and the next one should be orange. If there aren\u2019t enough cells to the left, this pattern wraps around to the other side of the same row, with the leftmost cell being teal.\\\\n28. To make the output, replace the exact position of red square in the new grid by a black square. Then place a green square at the position where the original red square\\\\\\'s column is set as the row, and the row is the column reversed from right to left. Correspondingly, you have to do similar operation at the symmetric position of the original red square: place a teal square at the position where the original red square\\\\\\'s column is set as the row, and the row is the column reversed from left to right, then place a yellow square right to the green square, and place an orange square right to the teal square. If the position doesn\\\\\\'t allow to place an yellow or orange square, then skip those squares.\\\\n29. The transformation involves generating a series of colored shapes (from colors that were not in the original input) around the red box. The generated shapes depend on the position of the red square:   - If the red square is at [1,1] position, then a green (3) square is generated at the top left, a yellow (6) square at the top middle, a teal (8) square at the bottom left, and a orange (7) square at bottom middle.   - If the red square is at [2,4] position, then a green (3) square is generated at the top right.  - If the red square is at [0,2] position, then a teal (8) square is generated at the middle, and a orange (7) square at the right in the second row.  - If the red square is at [1,3] position, a green (3) square is generated at the top middle, a yellow (6) square at the top right, a teal (8) square at the bottom middle, and a orange (7) square at bottom right.   The rest of the grid\\\\n30. The transformation happens as follows, a yellow point is placed on the same row as the red point except it\\\\\\'s placed on the second row from the left edge of the grid, a teal point is placed on the same column as the red point except it\\\\\\'s placed on the second row from the bottom edge of the grid, a grey point is placed two rows to the right of the yellow point and a fuschia point is placed two rows to the right of the teal point. If the red point is placed in such a way that prevents placing the other points in this way, then you move all the points to the left or down to make it possible.\\\\n31. To make the output, you have to rotate the red square 90 degrees clockwise and change the color from red to teal. Then, insert a yellow square to the right of the teal square, a fuschia square above the teal square, and a green square to the left of the fuschia square. Leave other squares black.\\\\n32. To make the output, you have to place a 3 (green) in the row above the location of red cell in the input grid, a 6 (fuschia) in the cell immediately to the right of the location of the green cell, an 8 (teal) in the cell below the green cell and a 7 (orange) in the cell immediately to the right of the teal cell. The remaining cells should be left black.\\\\n33. To make the output, start from the position of the red square when it is in the middle of top edge, three squares will be colored starting from it and going to the left. Skip the square directly to the left of the red square and starting from the next one color one blue, one brown and one fuschia. If the red square is not in the top edge, do not do anything. If the red square is at another position at the top edge, color squares to the lefthand side and bottom only, based on its position from the right. Always skip the square nearest to the red square and color the next three. The first one is teal if it\\\\\\'s in the next row otherwise it\\\\\\'s green. The second square is always orange. The third square is fuschia if it\\\\\\'s in the next row otherwise it\\\\\\'s yellow.\\\\n34. To make the output, you have to detect the location of the colored square. Replace the black squares above the colored square with green (left) and fuscia (right). Replace the black squares below the colored square with Teal (left) and orange (right). The squares are colored one by one on the left and right of the immediate black square above or below the colored square, in the pattern green (above left), fuschia (above right), teal (below left), orange (below right).\\\\n35. To make the output, each red spot moves diagonally to the bottom-right corner of the grid, filling the path with yellow cells. The cell where the red spot was originally turned into teal and the other previous yellow cells turned into green.\\\\n36. To make the output, you have to mirror image the position of the colored box from the input. When mirrored horizontally, the colored box from the input should be replaced by a different color (teal) on the output. The grid positions to the immediate left and right of the teal box should be filled with grey and green (in that respective order). If there is no grid position to the immediate left, then fill the position to the immediate right of the teal box with green and brown (in that respective order). Thus, the new colored box pattern can extend outside of the original grid size of the input.\\\\n37. To make the output, you have to locate the red box from the input grid, then replace the left neighbouring cell by green, the right one by yellow, the up one by teal and the down one by orange, if they exist. All the other cells remain black.\\\\n38. To make the output, you have to replace the black square immediately above the red square with green, the square to its right with yellow, the square below with teal, and the square to its left with orange. If these squares do not exist (eg. there is no square to its left because the red square is at the end of a row), then they are not replaced.\\\\n39. The red pixel in the input grid determines the position of the colored pixels in the output. But instead of one red pixel, the output will have a sequence of colored pixels in the shape of a cross. The sequence is green, yellow, fuschia, orange, teal starting from the center pixel and moving clockwise. The sequence restarts on the 5th pixel with the green color making up the cross.\\\\n40. To make the output, you have to mark the square corresponding to a red square in the input grid with a color scheme that is clockwise rotating colors. The color scheme rotation can be described as follows:  if a red square exists at the left edge of the grid, color the squares to its left, upper left, and upper center with green, teal, and brown, respectively. If a red square exists at the right edge of the grid, color the squares to its right, lower right, and lower center with orange, fuchsia, and green, respectively. If a red square exists at the top edge of the grid substitute it with teal and color the squares to its lower-left and lower-right with orange and fuchsia, respectively. If a red square exists at the bottom edge of the grid, substitute it with green and color the squares to its upper left and upper right with teal and brown, respectively.\\\\n41. For the transformation, the position of the red cell in the input grid triggers the creation of three different colored cells (green, fuschia, and teal) in the corresponding positions in the output grid. The position of these colors is rotated clockwise in each successive transformation. Firstly, the green cell appears to the left of the red cell\\\\\\'s position, then above, then to the right, and finally below its position. The fuschia cell follows the same pattern but from the right, then below, then to the left, and finally above. The teal cell appears at the opposite end of the green cell, only to rotate counter-clockwise subsequently.\\\\n42. To make the output, you have to place colored cells in positions relative to the red cell. To the right of the red cell, going clockwise, place a green cell, then two black cells, then a fuchsia cell, then teal cell to the left of the green cell if there is room. If there isn\\\\\\'t it should wrap around to the next row from the right. If there is no red cell in the row, leave it all black.\\\\n43. To make the output, you have to look at the row that has the red square in it. Then, change the squares left to the red one into green and the squares right to the red one into fuchsia. In the next row, change the same squares into orange and yellow, respectively while keeping squares in the columns unaffected.\\\\n44. To make the output, place a blue cell if the red cell is in the top row of the input, place a teal cell if the red cell is in the bottom row of the input. Directly to the right of the colored cell, place a green cell if colored cell is in the leftmost position, place fuschia cell if colored cell is in the third position from left, place a grey cell if colored cell is in the third position from right or rightmost position in the output grid. If the red cell was in the middle row of the input, the output remains the same as the input. All the other cells should remain black.\\\\n45. To make the output, you have to replace black squares around the red square with teal, fuschia, grey, green, and yellow ones. The replacement depends on the position of the red square.     If the red square is placed on the upper edge, it will be replaced with a green square, and the squares on its right and below will turn yellow and teal respectively. Under the green square, fuschia and black squares should follow respectively.     If the red square comes in the middle, it finds a grey square underneath, followed by a fuschia square.     If it is on the right edge, the red square is replaced with a green square. Then, the squares to its left and lower edge turn into grey and teal squares. Above the grey square, a yellow and a black square sit, respectively, from right to left.     If it comes at the bottom edge, you will find its upper square turns grey, followed by a blue square upwards.     Finally, if the red square finds itself in the left edge, it turns green first, and then the squares beside and above it change their colors to yellow and fuschia, respectively. Above the yellow square\\\\n46. To make the output, you have to replace the red pixel and the two pixels to the right of it with a multispectral gradient. The red pixel becomes green, the next pixel to the right becomes yellow, and the third pixel to the right becomes multicolored with the top pixel becoming fuschia, the middle pixel remaining black, and the bottom pixel becoming orange. If the red pixel is too close to the right edge of the grid to form this pattern, the pattern is instead applied vertically downwards from the red pixel. If the red pixel is too close to both edges to form this pattern completely, the remaining elements of the pattern are ignored.\\\\n47. The output grid is formed by placing blocks in specific orientations relative to the position of the red block in the input grid. Specifically, a green block is placed 2 blocks to the left of the red block, a teal block is placed 3 blocks to the left of the red block, a fuchsia block is placed 1 block to the right of the red block, and a brown block is placed 2 blocks to the right of the red block. If the red block in the input grid is against the edge and blocks cannot be placed outside the grid, then the relevant blocks are not added.\\\\n48. To make the output, you have to locate the red cell (2) and replace it with a green cell (3). Next, place an orange cell (7) to the right of the green cell. If the right cell is beyond the grid, place it to the left instead. Similarly, place a fuschia cell (6) to the right of the orange cell if possible, otherwise to its left. Similarly, place a teal cell (8) to the right of the fuschia cell, and so on until the fifth cell (Teal) is placed. Rotate the colors when placing the cells. All other cells should remain black (0).\\\\n49. To make the output, you have to generate new colored cells around the colored cell in the input. The colored cells appear in a particular order (green, yellow, teal, orange) and the first one is always to the right of the original colored cell. If the grid ends before all four new colored cells can be added, start adding them from the left of the colored cell.\\\\n50. To make the output, you have to identify the position of the red color in the input grid. From that red cell, inject colors in the following manners: 1. The immediate left cell of the red cell becomes green (if there is a cell immediately left to the red cell). 2. The immediate right cell of the red cell becomes yellow (if there is a cell immediately right to the red cell). 3. The cell that is second to the left of the red cell becomes teal (if there is a cell second to left from the red cell). 4. The cell that is second to the right of the red cell becomes orange (if there is a cell second to the right from the red cell). 5. The cell immediately below the red color becomes fuschia (if there is a cell immediately below the red cell). 6. The cell immediately above the red color becomes brown (if there is a cell immediately above the red cell).\\\\n51. To transform the input into the output, follow these steps:   1. Locate the position of the blue square in the input grid. 2. In the output grid, place a green square to the immediate left of the position where the blue square was found in the input grid. 3. Still in the output grid, place a fuschia square to the immediate right of where the blue square was found in the input grid. 4. Place a teal square two spaces to the left of where the blue square was found in the input grid. 5. And place an orange square two spaces to the right from where the blue square was found in the input grid. These will only appear if there is space without exceeding the grid limits.  Note: The rest of the output grid remains black.\\\\n52. In the transformation process, we identify the position of the red (2) cell in the input grid and then produce four different colored cells (green, fuschia, teal, and orange) in the output. These four colored cells appear in a certain sequence related to the original red cell position:   - The green cell (3) is directly above the original red cell position. It is positioned to the left if the red cell is in the top row. - The fuschia cell (6) is placed to the right of the green cell. If there\\\\\\'s no space to the right, it appears below the green cell. - The teal cell (8) is positioned directly below the original red cell. If the red cell is in the bottom row, the teal cell is positioned to the left. - The orange cell (7) is placed to the right of the teal cell. But if there\\\\\\'s no space to the right, it appears above the teal cell.   The rest of the cells in the output grid remain black, including the cell originally occupied by the red element in the input.\\\\n53. To make the output, you have to reflect the position of the blue square over the y-axis. The original blue square becomes a black square in the output while its reflected position is filled with green and yellow on the left and teal and orange on the right, each filling the square diagonally from the bottom-left to the top-right.\\\\n54. To make the output, you have to replace the first box in the direction of the rows with green, the second with yellow, the third with teal, and the rest with orange, corresponding to the placement of the red box in the input. If there are no boxes in that direction, black boxes are left in place. The operation takes place in each row independently.\\\\n55. To make the output, you have to take the red square and move it two squares to the right and replace its previous position with a green square. Then, replace the two squares to the left of it\\\\\\'s new position with a teal square and a brown square (in that order). If the red square is in an edge, wrap it around to the other side, following the same rules.\\\\n56. To make the output, at the position of the red cell in the input, change this cell and the ones directly to the right, to the left, below and above it, in this direct order: Green, Yellow, Teal, Orange and Fuchsia. The rest remains black. If the red cell is placed in such a position where it does not have a cell above or to the left, then these colors are assigned in the order breadths moving towards down and right. If it does not have a cell below or to the right, then the colors that would be in those positions are not considered. For example, if the red cell is right in the middle, the grid would be the following: [[0 0 3 0 6]  [0 0 5 0 0]  [0 0 8 0 7]]. If the red cell would be at position (1,2) then its left (which would be (1,1)) does not exist, therefore starts coloring it towards down and right ordering from green to fuchsia: [[0 0 3 0 0]  [0\\\\n57. To transform the input grid into the output grid, first identify the position of the red cell in the input grid. Create four colored cells in a line extending from the red cell location, outwards towards the left and downwards. The colors of these cells are green, black, teal, and yellow in the left direction and fuschia, black, orange and yellow in the down direction. The other black cells in the input grid remain black in the output grid.\\\\n58. The red cell determines two things: the row for the new colored cells and whether the cells are placed from right to left or left to right. The transformation is as follows:   If the red cell is located on the top row, the new colored cells should be placed on the bottom row from right to left. Load brown on the third column, teal on the fourth column, and fuschia on the second column.  If the red cell is located in the middle row, the new colored cells should be placed on the top row from right to left. Load green on the third column, grey on the fourth column, and brown on the second column.  If the red cell is located on the bottom row, the new colored cells should be placed in the middle row from left to right. Load teal on the second column, fuschia on the third column, and brown on the fourth column.  If the red cell is located in the middle of the grid (middle row and middle column), the new colored cells should be placed on the bottom row from left to right. Load green, grey, and brown starting from the second column to the fourth column.\\\\n59. To make the output, you have to insert colours in the output grid based on the location of the red cell in the input. If the red cell appears in the middle row, insert a sequence (green, nothing, teal, nothing, nothing) in the top row and (fuschia, nothing, orange, nothing, nothing) in the bottom row of the output. If the red cell appears in the top row, add this sequence to the middle row of the output, and if it appears in the bottom row, add it to the top row. If the position of the red cell is such that it is supposed to lighten up a non-existing cell, ignore it.\\\\n60. The transformation rules are related to the position of the red box (2). The box left and right above the red box turns green (3). The boxes below and to the right of the red box turns to teal (8), the boxes below and to the left shapes turn fuschia (6), and the box left and right below the red box become orange (7). All other boxes remain black. If the red box is at an edge or a corner, only possible transformations apply.\\\\n61. To make the output, you have to find the red blocks in the input and focus on its horizontal and vertical positions. In the output, place a green block one square East, a grey block two squares East, a teal block one square South, an orange block two squares South, and a fuschia block both one square East and one square South from the red block\\\\\\'s position in the input. Maintain the position of the red block as black. If the red block\\\\\\'s position and the offset fall off the grid, ignore offset that falls off the grid.\\\\n62. To make the output, you have to replace each column that contains a red square with specific colors in a top down order: green, yellow, teal, orange and fuschia, and replace the others with black. If the red square is in the middle of the column, then you begin the color series from the same level of red square but in other columns, discarding the colors that would be above it and keeping the colors that would be below it.\\\\n63. To make the output, you have to rotate the grid 90 degrees counter clockwise. Then replace black cell with green cell at the position where red was originally located. Fill up the 2 cell to the right side of it with blue and yellow, and the 2 cell below it with orange and teal irrespective of grid boundary.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 104}\")": "After analyzing the rules, they can be categorized into eight distinct categories based on their similarities:\n\n1.

The transformation involves replacing the black cells that are not totally surrounded by other black cells with yellow cells, but the colored shape from the input remains the same in the output.\\\\n3. To make the output, you will first fill in the black cross in the middle with yellow. After that, you will fill in the remaining black areas with yellow, but they should be in a mirrored arrangement to the cross in the middle. This will create a symmetrical pattern. The original rectangle retain its color. This transformation acts like spreading a yellow color starting from the central color rectangle to the surrounding black area, with a mirrored pattern.\\\\n4. The transformation is the addition of a yellow diamond around the color shape in the center of the grid. The diamond fits the space left from the color shape to the edges of the grid.\\\\n5. To make the output, you have to draw a yellow line diagonally from top left to the middle of the shape and from the middle to the bottom right. Then draw another yellow line diagonally from the top right to the middle and from the middle to the bottom left, thus making a cross. The remaining empty (black) spaces outside of the original colored shape should be translated into the same yellow color.\\\\n6. To make the output, you have to draw a diagonal from the top left to bottom right in the empty space of the input grid with yellow color. Only fill the cells where row number is equal to column number.\\\\n7. To make the output, you have to switch the non-border elements of the uniform color shape to yellow while maintaining the border of the original color. Then replace the black background with a diamond-shaped pattern of yellow and black.\\\\n8. There are three steps to transform the input grid: 1. Draw a yellow square from the top left corner until it reaches the color rectangle in any direction. If it hits the color rectangle on the corner, the diagonal line between the corner and the square\\\\\\'s center will be inside the square. The yellow square will be bigger as much as possible. 2. The color rectangle maintains its original color and position. 3. The rest of the grid remains black.\\\\n9. To make the output, first retain the original colored shape. Then, fill the black space, from the edge of the colored shape to the edge of the grid, with the color yellow and alternate the filling direction between rows and columns. If a row or column has already been filled with yellow, leave that row or column black.\\\\n10. The transformation fills in the empty space in the grid (represented by black pixels), which is outside of but adjacent to the colored rectangle, with yellow pixels. Yellow pixels are not added to the interior of the rectangle. The same process is applied to the black pixels above the rectangle as well, maintaining a \\\\\\'border\\\\\\' of black pixels at the top of the grid.\\\\n11. To make the output, you have to replace every black (0) pixel that is neighboring with colored pixel with yellow (4), keeping the original shape colored pixels as they were in the input.\\\\n12. To make the output, you have to .fill the empty space in the trapezoidal shape with yellow squares and yellow squares are also added diagonally on the outside corners of the shape, maintaining the symmetry of the grid\\\\n13. To make the output, you create a bigger square or rectangle around the colored shape using yellow cells that fits within the grid. If the resulting yellow cells touch the border of the grid, leave it as is. If the resulting yellow cells don\\\\\\'t touch any part of the grid, convert the corners of the new big square or rectangle to black cells.\\\\n14. The transformation pattern involves filling the empty (black) areas of the shape and its perimeter with yellow color. The inner part of the shape remains in the original color, while the outer cells outside the shape remain black.\\\\n15. To make the output, you have to fill the cells that are diagonally next to the green cells with yellow cells if they are black.\\\\n16. To make the output, you have to create a yellow diamond shape starting from the center of each colored shape in the input grid. The largest diagonal of the diamond should equal to the colored shape\\\\\\'s width in case the shape is a rectangle, or side length in case the shape is a square. The remaining cells should remain the same as in the input.\\\\n17. To make the output, you have to fill the black cells that are directly adjacent (horizontally or vertically, not diagonally) to any colored cell with a yellow color and leave the remaining black cells as they are. This effectively creates a yellow border around the colored shape. The original colored shapes stay same.\\\\n18. To make the output, you have to insert a smaller square inside the colored square in the input. This smaller square should be formed by \"yellow\" cells (number 4). The size of the \"yellow\" square is determined by the largest possible square that can fit inside the colored square. Fill the remaining spaces outside the colored square but inside the contour of the largest possible \\\\\\'yellow\\\\\\' square with \\\\\\'yellow\\\\\\' cells. Note, from the given examples, seems like the smallest size of the smaller square that can be formed is 1x1.\\\\n19. To form the output, add a yellow (number 4) diagonal starting from top left to bottom right and another diagonal starting from top right to bottom left through the empty space of the input grid. If there is a colored cell (not black) in the path, then keep it as is without changing to yellow.\\\\n20. To get to the output grid from the input grid, one needs to replace the black cells in the input grid with yellow if they are directly on a diagonal from a colored cell (either primary diagonal or secondary). If a black cell in the input grid is surrounded by yellow cells on 4 sides (left, right, top, and bottom) in the output grid, that cell should also be colored yellow. All non-black cells in the input grid should remain the same in the output grid.\\\\n21. To make the output grid, you create concentric rectangles or squares within the colored rectangle or square in the input, leaving the colored borders intact. The border color remains the same, but the filled cells become yellow. For the rest of the grid, you color the standalone cells progressively from the outside to the inside, excluding the colored borders. The standalone cells are also colored yellow.\\\\n22. For each cell in the grid, if the cell is black and it is part of a 3x3 (or larger) square of black cells, change it to yellow. All other cells stay the same. The transformation doesn\\\\\\'t affect cells at the edge of the grid as they cannot be part of a 3x3 square of black cells.\\\\n23. The output is formed by replacing the area outside the rectangular shape with the new color (yellow) as long as the area does not hit the border of the grid. For the area within the rectangle or crossing the edges of the grid, the color remains the same.\\\\n24. The transformation is as follows: 1. The yellow stamped shape (number 4) is a smaller version of the activating (receiving) shape. Rotate the yellow shape 45 degrees counterclockwise (or 45 degrees clockwise if you think of it as starting from the lower right corner and spiraling in) until its corners fill in the original colored shape (as you see with numbers 3, 6, 7). 2. Keep the original colored shape as it is (do not uberpaint the shape in yellow). 3. The black cells that do not get stamped with the yellow shape remain black in the output grid.\\\\n25. To make the output, you have to trace an arrow pointing upward made out of colored cells exists in the grid. Fill the up-facing arrow with yellow. The base of the arrow should be at the bottom of the grid.\\\\n26. To make the output, you have to fill the remaining black space within the colored frame with yellow, but invert the pattern. Any black space that directly touches the colored frame (top, bottom, left or right - not diagonally), should remain black. Any black space that does not directly touch the frame, and is surrounded by black spaces on all sides should be filled with yellow. It should look like a yellow version of the initial shape is inscribed within the original colored shape.\\\\n27. To make the output, you have to fill all the empty spaces (black color) outside the shape with yellow. Inside any hollow part of the shape, change the squares to yellow, but also go diagonally to change the squares that are not part of the shape. The colored shapes (not black or yellow) must remain the same.\\\\n28. Here\u2019s how to transform the input grid into the output. First, fill the empty space inside the colored grid cells in the input with yellow cells. Then, for the perimeter of these yellow cells, replace black cells between the corners of this filled yellow box with yellow cells as well. Rest all will be the same colored cells as in the input grid.\\\\n29. If the cell is black, change it to yellow but only if it\\\\\\'s inside the minimal rectangle that captures the colored elevated object. Draw the exact same object shape, but instead in color grey (4). This shape drawing should overlap on top of the yellow color.   So imagine drawing a box around the colored objects, if the surrounding black cells are inside the box, turn them yellow. Then duplicate the original color object on top of the yellow cells in grey.\\\\n30. To create the output, every black cell that has at least one colored neighbour is replaced by a yellow cell. Additionally, the original colored pattern is preserved.\\\\n31. To get the output, replace the black cells on the diagonals from each of the corners of the grid (excluding the corners, which belong to the shape) with yellow cells (4). The rest of the grid remains the same.\\\\n32. To make the output, you need to add in yellow cells. The pattern of yellow cells should mirror the shape made out of the colored cells from the input, but flipped 180 degrees. The resulting yellow shape should be centered vertically and horizontally in the grid. The originally colored cells from the input should remain the same color in the output.\\\\n33. To make the output, replace the black cells which are next to any non-black cells (diagonal included) by yellow cells, and keep the non-black cells as they are.\\\\n34. To make the output, fill all cells which are completely surrounded by non-black cells with yellow (the color can vary depending on the case, but it should be different from the color of the shape and the black cells). The surrounding non-black cells should form a continuous border around the cells to be filled. The border can be diagonal as well.\\\\n35. To make the output, you have to fill the black cells with the yellow color to create a larger shape. The previous colored shape (either green, orange or fuchsia) remains as it is. If the black cell is not adjacent to any colored cell or is at the very edge of the grid, leave it black.\\\\n36. First, replicate the colored pattern from the input in the output. Then, for every point that is inside the colored pattern, replace it with the color 4. For the rest of the points, if the point is contiguous to at least one black cell (in any of the eight directions) and at least one cell belonging to the input color pattern taken from the input, then also replace it with the color 4.\\\\n37. To make the output, you have to perform an operation on the non-black squares. The operation is as follow: Starting from the non-black square closest to the top, replace the empty squares surrounding it by color yellow until reaching a non-black square, then you have to stop replacing.\\\\n38. The output grid is obtained by transforming the interior black cells (0) of the border into yellow cells (4) while maintaining the existing color borders. Additionally, any black cells that are adjacent to the border diagonally are also turned into yellow cells.\\\\n39. To make the output, you have to draw a yellow cross (made up of 5 yellow squares - one in the middle and one on each side) in the center of the solid color shape. Meanwhile, for the empty spaces out of the colored shape, convert the empty black cells into yellow cells if it surrounded by black cells in all four directions. If not and has any adjacent colored cells, leave it as black.\\\\n40. To make the output, you have to fill in the black cells that are inbetween the colored shape and the boundary of the grid (not including the boundary itself) with yellow cells. The colored shape remains unchanged and any black cells on the border of the grid also remain unchanged.\\\\n41. To make the output, draw a line on the black portion from the top left to the bottom right corner, the fill the left side of the line with yellow if the figure is fuschia, and with fuschia if it is green. For all cases the right side of the line remains black.\\\\n42. To make the output, you have to replicate the initial shape onto the black area by mirroring it along horizontal or vertical axes or both, if possible, and color it in yellow. The parts of the black area that weren\\\\\\'t filled by the mirrored shape remain black. Keep the original shape in its primary color.\\\\n43. To transform the input grid into the output grid, you need to draw a diagonal line cross the grid from top left to bottom right and replace the black cells (0s) with yellow cells (4s) in the upper triangular (including the diagonal line), but keep the colored area (either 6,7 or 3) without changes. For the lower triangular part, including the diagonal line, keep them as it is.\\\\n44. The transformation involves replacing cells outside the pattern (which are black) with bright yellow(4) in a radial symmetric pattern. The cells inside the coloured pattern remain the same. Effectively, you are drawing an X with yellow over the input, keeping intact the cells inside the colored pattern.\\\\n45. To make the output, you have to replace black squares surrounded by colored squares with yellow squares and fill out a diagonal yellow square shape based on the location of colored squares. Empty (black) squares not surrounded by colored ones remain empty, and colored squares remain the same.\\\\n46. To produce the output, fill all the black squares that have at least one color square (non-black) bordering them with a yellow color. The rest of the squares, including the original colored part in the input, remain unchanged.\\\\n47. To make the output, you have to identify the cells inside the perimeter defined by colored squares (which are not black) and fill all black cells inside that perimeter with yellow squares. Next, fill the black cells outside of the perimeter in a diagonal pattern with yellow squares as well. The direction of the diagonal pattern is bottom left to upper right. All original colors stay the same.\\\\n48. In the process of transformation, start by identifying the pattern of colored pixels on the grid. Afterward draw a diagonal cross, that starts from all the corners and meets at the middle, with the yellow colour on the positions of the grid remaining blanks after the pattern. The intersection of the cross, the size and position depends on the pattern, should be at the middle of the grid. The output is the combination of the cross and the initial pattern.\\\\n49. To make the output, you have to transform all black cells to yellow color (4), if and only if they are located on diagonal or anti-diagonal. Keep color unaltered for all other colored squares and background squares.\\\\n50. To make the output, for the part of the grid that is not part of the coloured rectangle or the coloured ring, you have to fill the centre with colour number 4 (yellow) if the centre is surrounded with at least three black cells; the rest just copy the colour from the input. If the centre is on the corner (the top left, top right, bottom left and bottom right corner), it will be colored with number color 4 (yellow), if it has the black cell on its two sides.\\\\n51. To make the output, you have to fill the inner square with yellow. Then place a cross of yellow filled squares inside the large square overlapping the smaller square.\\\\n52. To make the output, start from the top left cell and for every black cell, paint it yellow (4); except the black cells that touch the border of the grid or the border of any colored shape; these should remain black. Keep the colored shapes untouched (6,7,3 to remain 6,7,3).\\\\n53. To make the output, you have to change all the black cells that are a distance of one cell away from a colored cell (0 black; 1:blue; 2:red; 3:green; 4:yellow; 5:grey; 6:fuschia; 7:orange; 8:teal; 9:brown) into the color Yellow. The rest of black cells and colored cells remain the same.\\\\n54. To obtain the output from the input, fill the empty space inside the colored square with yellow. The rest of the empty black squares outside of the colored figure should be filled with yellow following a specific pattern: Starting from the center of the empty space, draw a diagonal line of yellow to the four corners of the grid. Empty squares that intersect these lines will also be colored yellow.\\\\n55. To make the output, you have to change the color of all the squares (that are not part of the specific shape) which shares a side or a corner (directly or indirectly) with the colored shape / box in the input, to yellow. The squares that do not share a side or corner with the shape should remain black. The squares inside the shape remain unchanged.\\\\n56. To generate the output, we fill the cells by looking at the surrounding 8 cells (diagonals included). If at least three of the eight surrounding cells are green, color the cell yellow; if not, leave the original color.\\\\n57. To make the output, you have to draw a diagonal yellow line from each corner of the grid through the center to the opposite corner (forming an X shape). Let the color, of the figure from the input grid, remain the same while the black pixels get turned to yellow along the path of the diagonal lines.\\\\n58. To form the output grid, copy the colored shape from the input grid to the output grid. Then change all black cells which are neighboring (either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) to a colored cell from the input into yellow in the output. All other cells should be copied from input without any change.\\\\n59. To make the output, change the black squares surrounding the shape to yellow squares but not touching the shape. If black squares touch the corners of the shape - diagonal touching does not count - they are turned yellow. The color of the shape remains the same.\\\\n60. To make the output: - The coloured shape remains the same. - Add a line of yellow cells that diagonally crosses the grid from the left top corner to the right bottom corner. - On the first half diagonal, fill the cells that are to the left of the diagonal line with yellow. - On the second half diagonal, fill the cells that are above the diagonal line with yellow.   This rule applies regardless of the size of the grid.\\\\n61. To make the output, you need to draw with yellow color the tiles leftwards, rightwards, upwards and downwards from the original place of the number, but the yellow color does not overwrite the originally colored areas. This will form a plus shape with the center at the original location. Keep the original colors at any positions that were colored in the first place.\\\\n62. To make the output, you have to first locate the color from the four corners of the input and then for each black box, if it is touched by the corner color on a corner diagonally, change it to yellow. All black boxes on the boundaries of their containing rectangles/squares are converted to yellow. If a black box is inside a rectangle/square of the corner color and doesn\\\\\\'t touch any box of that color, it should be left as is. Finally, all the corner boxes are also changed to yellow.\\\\n63. The transformation of the grid primarily involves two steps:  1) Mirror the flipped-over-its-right-side image of the block made by colored cells (that are not black) in the center of the grid below.  2) Transform all the cells that were previously blank but now part of the new shape formed by mirroring to yellow cells. Keep all the previous colored cells (that are not black and not part of the mirrored image) as it is.\\\\n64. To make the output, you need to fill the cells in the grid following these rules. Starting from the middle you fill every cell directly accessible horizontally or vertically with the number 4 (representing the color yellow) without crossing colored cells or corners diagonally. The remaining cells remain with their original colors.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "Category 1: Rules involving the creation of a yellow border or envelope around the colored shape.\n- Rule 1\n- Rule 10\n- Rule 11\n- Rule 17\n- Rule 46\n- Rule 53\n- Rule 58\n- Rule 59\nSynthesized Rule: To make the output, you have to create a yellow border around the colored shape, replacing black cells that are directly adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to any colored cell.

For each category, synthesize the rules into a single, specific rule that combines the ideas of all rules in that category, while clearly differentiating it from the other categories.\\\\nThe new rule should be as specific as possible, following the format of the given rules.\\\\nThe new rule should be applicable without any information from the original rules - i.e. it should be standalone.\\\\n\\\\nRules:\\\\n1. To make the output, each unit in the input grid needs to be magnified to a 5 x 5 square in the output grid, while maintaining their respective positions. For example, if there is a red point in the top left of the input grid, it should become a 5 x 5 square of red points in the top left of the output grid.\\\\n2. Each colored cell in the input grid expands to form a 5x5 square of the same colour in the output grid. The relative positions are maintained. Black cells in the input expand to 5x5 black squares in the output. The multiplication factor for each cell is 5, i.e., each cell in the input grid becomes a 5x5 square of the same color in the output grid.\\\\n3. Each color square in the input grid will be magnified 5 times in the output grid. Meaning, a 1x1 square will become a 5x5 square in the output of the same color, and their positions in relation to each other will remain the same. Black squares also undergo the same transformation.\\\\n4. To produce the output grid, replace every cell from the input grid by a 5 by 5 square of the same color. That means, each color in the input grid should be turned into a square of 5x5 of the same color in the output. The order and position of the colors should be maintained.\\\\n5. In order to convert the input grid into the output, the entire grid is enlarged by making each cell from the input grid into a 5x5 block of cells in the output grid. The color of the cells within each block should match their corresponding cells from the input grid. Empty(black) cells in the input remain as black cells in the output.\\\\n6. The transformation involves inflating each individual cell in the input grid into a nxn block of cells in the output grid, where each new cell in the block replicates the value (or colour) of the corresponding cell in the input grid. Essentially, each coloured cell in the input is being upscaled to a square block of the same colour in the output grid. The place of this block in the output grid corresponds to the place of that cell in the input grid.\\\\n7. To make the output, you have to increase the scale of each color block in the input by 5 times and replace the empty blocks with black blocks of 5x5. Each color expands in its direction with the color blocks and the empty blocks surrounding them maintain the position. The top left remains the top left, the bottom right remains the bottom right, and so forth. The transformed larger color blocks maintain the same relative positioning as they did in the input grid.\\\\n8. To make the output, you have to enlarge each 1x1 square in the input into a 5x5 block in the output of the same color, in the same relative position.\\\\n9. To make the output, each square of the grid should be replaced by a 5x5 square in the output grid of the same color. The pattern is scaled up by five times.\\\\n10. Each cell in the input square grid is translated into a corresponding 5x5 cell block in the output grid, with non-black color cells in the input grid maintaining their color in the corresponding block in the output, and black cells remaining black in the output. For instance, a single red cell in the input grid translates into a 5x5 block of red in the output grid, and an empty/black cell in the input grid translates into a 5x5 block of black/empty in the output grid.\\\\n11. To make the output, you have to scale the input grid five times, where each cell in the input grid corresponds to a 5x5 segment in the output grid. Each segment will have all its cells with same color as the corresponding cell in the input grid.\\\\n12. To transform the input grid to the output grid, each cell in the input grid is replicated to a 5x5 square in the output grid positioned analogously to its position in the input grid. All zeros are retained during the process.\\\\n13. To make the output, you have to scale each cell from the input grid by a factor of 5. The transformed cells must retain their color in the output grid. In other words, increase the size of each square in the input by 5 times by repeating the number that is in the square.\\\\n14. To make the output, you have to multiply each cell in the input by 5. For example, if the cell (2,2) in the input grid is red, then create a 5x5 red colored grid at the position (10:14,10:14) in the output. Transform every cell in the same way.\\\\n15. To make the output, you have to  expand each cell of the input grid to a 5x5 square of that same cell\\\\\\'s color in the corresponding location in the output grid.\\\\n16. To make the output, you must magnify each cell in the input grid. Each cell becomes a square of 3x3 or 5x5 cells in the output grid, keeping the same color or lack of color (black) as the original cell from the input grid. Each row in the input corresponds to a section in the output.\\\\n17. To make the output, you have to increase the size of the grid such that each cell in the input grid becomes a 5x5 subgrid in the output. Each integer in the input grid represents a color, and each 5x5 subgrid in the output should be a replication of that color. If a space in the input is empty (0), leave that corresponding 5x5 section in the output empty as well.\\\\n18. To make the output, you have to scale up each non-zero number in the input grid to a 5x5 sub-square in the output grid. More specifically, replace each colored number in the input with a 5x5 block of the same color in the output, keeping their relative positions the same. The zeros remain as single cells in the output.\\\\n19. Transform the grid by scaling it up such that each colored cell in the input grid is expanded into a block of 5x5 cells of the same color in the output. The black cells are also expanded in the same way.\\\\n20. To make the output, you have to scale up every color-coded cell in the input by replacing each with a 5x5 (or 3x3 or 2x2) matrix of the same color. Leave the black cells as they are. Specifically, the top left cell of the input grid maps to a 5x5 (3x3 or 2x2) section in the top left of the output grid, and so on, such that each cell in the input grid maps to a corresponding 5x5 (3x3 or 2x2) section in the output grid. That is, the input grid cell value of 2 would transform into a 5x5 (3x3 or 2x2) section filled with 2s in the output grid, and the same applies to all other values apart from 0.\\\\n21. To make the output, you have to magnify the input grid. Take each square from the input and transform it into a 5x5 grid (if the input has 5 colored squares in a line) of the same color. For example, if the square is colored red in the input, it should be transformed into a 5x5 red square in the output. Black squares should remain black in the output.\\\\n22. To make the output, you have to expand each square in the input by 5 times to form a bigger square in the output. Each bigger square in the output thus consists of 25 smaller squares of the same color as the original single square in the input. This isn\\\\\\'t merely a replication; every single square in the input becomes 5x bigger in each dimension in the output. The position and alignment of the colored squares in the output correspond to those in the input. Black squares (number 0) in the input grid would also expand in the same way.\\\\n23. To make the output, you have to upscale the whole grid five times. Each square of the input grid becomes a 5x5 square on the output grid. A black square in the input grid is up-scaled to a 5x5 black square on the output, and colored squares are also up-scaled to 5x5 squares in the corresponding color.\\\\n24. To make the output, you have to replicate each color 5 times in both the column and row. Black color squares or non-color squares are also expanded in the same way. The 3x3 grid should thus be turned into a 15x15 grid, with each colored square in the input grid having 5 duplicates in both the column and row. The black color is treated as a background and is expanded for any non-color square in the input grid.\\\\n25. To make the output, for every cell in the output grid, get the corresponding cell from the input grid and fill 5x5 area in the output with the same color. Place those 5x5 areas into the exact same pattern with the input, resulting in a scaled-up output where each color in the input is represented by a 5x5 patch of color in the output. If a cell in the input grid is black, make the corresponding 5x5 area in the output also black.\\\\n26. Each coloured cell in the input replicates to form a square of the same colour in the output that is 5x5 in size, placed in the corresponding position in the output grid. The position of the squares and their colours in the output grid correspond directly to the positions and colours of their originating cells in the input grid. If the cell in the input grid is black, the corresponding square in the output grid will also be black.\\\\n27. To make the output, you should expand each cell from the input grid into a 5x5 square in the corresponding position in the output grid. The resulting squares should all be filled with the colour from the original 1x1 cell in the input. For any black cells in the input (number 0), the corresponding 5x5 square in the output should also be black.\\\\n28. To make the output, scale up each cell of the input grid into a 5x5 grid. Each original cell in the input should correspond to a 5x5 area in the output, with all cells of that 5x5 area being the same color as the original cell. In this way, the whole grid should be enlarged five times in both the horizontal and vertical directions.\\\\n29. To make the output, you have to replicate each square of the input grid n times vertically and horizontally. For example in Case 0, the red square in the top left corner of the input is transformed into a 2x2 red square in the corresponding position in the output. Similarly, the orange square is transformed into a 2x2 orange square in the output. Repeat this process for every colored square in the input.\\\\n30. To make the output, each colored cell from the input (excluding black) is expanded into a square of 5x5 of the same color in the corresponding position on the output grid. Black cells remain the same size and location.\\\\n31. To make the output, you have to use a magnification rule. Each cell in the input grid, regardless of its color, becomes a 5x5 square of the same color in the output grid. The positioning of these 5x5 squares corresponds to the position of each cell in the input grid.\\\\n32. To make the output, you have to expand section of the input by transforming each color into a larger square of cells with the same color or lack thereof. Each colored cell in the original grid is turned into a 5x5 square of the same color in the output. Each black cell is turned into a 5x5 square of black cells.\\\\n33. To create the output grid, first scale the input grid by 5 times in both dimensions. This means each cell in the input grid becomes a 5x5 square of the same color in the output grid. Each 1x1 cell in the input, regardless of color, becomes a 5x5 square of that color in the output. All original black squares in the input should also be represented as 5x5 squares of black in the output.\\\\n34. Each color or blank space in the input expands by five in both rows and columns in the output. The rest of the grid remains in black.\\\\n35. To make the output, you have to expand each square in the input grid into a 5x5 grid with the same color in the output grid.\\\\n36. To make the output, you have to expand each cell in the input by a factor of 5. The expansion is done by mapping each cell in the input to a 5x5 portion in the output. Therefore, the color of each cell in the input is expanded to fill a new 5x5 portion in the output grid, and black cells from the input remain as 5x5 black cells in the output. The expansion is done row-wise from left to right and top to bottom.\\\\n37. To make the output, you have to enlarge every cell in the input by 5 times. Each single colored cell in the input becomes a 5x5 square of the same color in the output. This effectively increases the size of the grid by a factor of 5.\\\\n38. To make the output, you have to expand each box of the input to a 5x5 area of the same color. The 5x5 areas should be laid out in the same configuration as the original 3x3 grid. This effectively enlarges the original grid by a scale of 5.\\\\n39. To make the output, you have to enlarge the original grid to 5 times of its size. Each original cell from the input grid should be expanded into a 5x5 cells in the output grid, maintaining its color. For example, if a cell in the input grid is red, this should correspond to a 5x5 red square in the output grid.\\\\n40. To make the output, you have to expand each cell of the input to be a 5x5 grid of the same color in the corresponding position in the output. Each single cell from the input becomes a square of 5 by 5 cells in the output and the output cells have the same color as the single input cell they come from.\\\\n41. To make the output, each cell of the input grid should be replicated 5 times both horizontally and vertically. This causes each distinct 1x1 cell in the input to correspond to a 5x5 subgrid of the identical color in the output. A \"0\" or black cell in the input becomes a 5x5 subgrid of \"0\" or black cells in the output. Cells with other values such as \"2\" or \"4\" are similarly expanded into a 5x5 subgrid of that same value.\\\\n42. To make the output, consider every cell of the input grid. If the cell is colored, then color 3 or 5 cells in the output grid in the same position, putting aside the black cells. Keep the shape and dimensions the same as on the input grid. The number of colored cells in the output (3 or 5) depends on the presence of diverse colored cells in the input. Use 5 cells for diverse and 3 for the same colored cells in the input.\\\\n43. To make the output, you have to expand each cell in the input grid into a 5x5 square in the output grid. Thus, for each cell in the input grid, the corresponding value will be repeating 5 times in the corresponding row and column in the output grid, forming a larger 5x5 square. For example, if cell (1,1) in the input grid contains the number 2, then cells (5*n+1, 5*m+1) through (5*n+5, 5*m+5) in the output grid should contain the number 2, where n and m are the row and column indices of the cell in the input grid.\\\\n44. To make the output, you have to expand each individual input box into a 5x5 box of the same color in the corresponding location in the output grid. Black cells should also be expanded in the same manner.\\\\n45. To make the output, each cell in the input grid is expanded to a square in the output of size equal to the input cell\\\\\\'s value. For example, an input cell with a value of 2 will become a 2x2 square in the output, all cells in the output square maintaining the original color of the input cell. The black cells in the input grid remain the same in the output increasing in size but not changing color.\\\\n46. The transformation involves multiplying the original grid by 5. Each number represented in the 3x3 input grid is repeated five times in both the row and column directions in the output grid. In other words, a single cell from the input grid is expanded into a 5x5 square in the output grid with the same value.\\\\n47. To make the output, each cell in the input grid is transformed into a square of 5x5 cells in the output grid, generating a sort of magnified version of the input grid. The color or number of each input box is preserved in the corresponding output square. The position of these squares in the output grid correspond to the position of the cells in the input grid, forming a bigger and pixelated version of the input.\\\\n48. To make the output, you have to enlarge the input grid 5 times in both the width and height. Keep every cell\\\\\\'s color from the input when enlarging. If the cell from the input is black, keep it black in the output. Otherwise, repeat the cell\\\\\\'s color across a 5x5 block in the corresponding position in the output.\\\\n49. To make the output grid, each cell in the input grid is enlarged into a square consisting of 5x5 cells of the same color as the input cell in the output grid. Repeat this for each colored cell in the input grid, ignoring black cells. Black cells in the input will remain black in the output, without expanding.\\\\n50. To make the output, you have to repeat each cell 5 times both horizontally and vertically. In other words, each cell on the input grid becomes a 5x5 grid cell on the output grid with the original color from the input grid.\\\\n51. To make the output you have to enlarge each square of the input grid into a 5x5 square of the same color in the corresponding position in the output grid. The colors remain the same as in the input.\\\\n52. Each cell of the input grid is enlarged to a 5x5 cell retaining its color in the output grid, which is black or the color of the input cell.\\\\n53. To create the output, each cell in the input grid should be transform to a 5x5 block in the output grid. If the cell in the input grid is not black, then all the cells in the corresponding 5x5 block in the output grid should be the same color as that cell. If the cell in the input grid is black, then all the cells in the corresponding 5x5 block in the output grid should remain black. Essentially, it is a zoom-in, mass upscaling process.\\\\n54. To make the output, each color pixel in the input grid is translated into a 5x5 grid of the same color pixel in the same relative position in the output grid. All background cells remain static.\\\\n55. To make the output, you have to take each square from the input grid, amplify it\\\\\\'s size by replicating it to create a 5x5 duplicate of each square while maintaining the positional characteristics of the original grid.\\\\n56. To form the output, each non-black color square in the input grid needs to be expanded to 5x5 squares of the same color in the output grid, relative to their original positions, and the empty spaces will be filled with black.\\\\n57. To create the output, each number in the input grid is expanded into a 5x5 sub-grid of the same number in the output. The numbers are repeated in the same relative placement. If a cell in the input is black, the corresponding 5x5 sub-grid in the output will also be black.   For example, if we had a 3x3 input grid [[a,b,c],[d,e,f],[g,h,i]], we would end up with a 15x15 output grid where the first 5x5 grid corresponds to the number \\\\\\'a\\\\\\', the next 5x5 grid to \\\\\\'b\\\\\\', and so on.\\\\n58. To make the output, you have to stretch the input grid by a factor of five in both directions. Each cell in the input grid becomes a five-by-five square in the output grid with the same color as the original cell.\\\\n59. To make the output, you have to take each cell in the input grid and expand it into a 5x5 block of the same color in the output grid, replicating the arrangement of the input grid.\\\\n60. To create the output grid, each cell in the input grid should be magnified. Specifically, where there is a colored cell in the input grid, it should be expanded to a 5x5 square of the same color in the output grid. Black cells in the input remains the same in the output.\\\\n61. To make the output, you have to expand each cell in the input to a 5x5 square filled with the same number in the original input. Each cell essentially becomes a larger colored square in the output, maintaining their relative positions.\\\\n62. To make the output, you have to zoom and split each cell from the input grid into a 5x5 area on the output grid with the same color as the original cell. All the cells that were black in the input remain black, effectively forming a grid pattern in the output.\\\\n63. To make the output, for every non-black pixel in the input, replace it with a 5x5 block of pixels of the same color in the corresponding position in the output. The black pixels in the input are left black in the output, but retain its corresponding place and size in terms of grid cells in the output grid.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "After analyzing the rules, they can be categorized into eight distinct categories based on their similarities.

The transformation rule is as follow: cyan cells are identified by their vertical rows which are then placed in a 3x3 grid. Each row becomes a column. From left to right in the 3x3 grid, the first column represents the first row of cyan cells, the second column corresponds to the second row and the third column to the third row. If a row of cyan is not present, that corresponding column remains black.\\\\n2. To make the output, you have to count the number of columns and rows made of teal squares in the input and create a 3x3 grid where the square in the middle is black, the amount of teal squares corresponds to the amount of columns/rows in the input and the rest of the squares in the output are black.\\\\n3. To make the output, you have to condense the input grid. On the condensing process, every third line (grey or black) becomes a single line in the output grid. The lines in-between (usually black) will be deleted. Teal cells are kept while black cells are turned to grey cells when condensing.\\\\n4. To make the output, you have to compress the input grid in such a way that the \\\\\\'T\\\\\\' shape becomes a 3x3 grid. Then, from top to bottom, fill the row with teal if the crossbar of the \\\\\\'T\\\\\\' in the input has at least one teal square in it, otherwise, fill the row with black.\\\\n5. To make the output, you have to first identify the shape of the teal squares in the middle of the grey squares if there is any. Then replicate this shape in the top row of the 3x3 output. If teal square is in the middle row of the grey squares, replicate the shape in the middle row of the 3x3 output. If the teal square shape is at the bottom of the grey squares shape, replicate the shape in the bottom row of the 3x3 output. Fill in remaining area with black.\\\\n6. To make the output: 1. Start by focusing on the horizontal teal band in the middle.  2. The teal squares at the leftmost and rightmost sides are maintained in the output. 3. If the band extends to the grey border, it gets reflected upwards in the output, leaving the corresponding part in the output band black. 4. Leave the remaining squares black. This forms a 3x3 grid that captures the configuration of the teal squares in the rectangular shape in the original grid.\\\\n7. To generate the output from the input, dimensionally reduce the grey rectangle by replacing every three consecutive cells with a single cell in the output grid. The enclosed teal area within the grey shape is replaced by the teal cell in the corresponding position of the output grid. If no teal is in the original three cells, replace them with a black cell in the output. The enclosed teal area can encompass one, two, three, or more cells, depending on the original rectangle\\\\\\'s dimensions.\\\\n8. To make the output, you need to create a 3x3 grid where the top row consists of teal cells if there is a teal figure within the ring in the input grid. For the other two rows in the output grid, if there is any grey cell on the same row in the input grid, the corresponding cell in the output grid should be black.\\\\n9. The center of the output grid is determined by the content of the innermost 3x3 square. If its center contains a green square, the corresponding spot in the output grid will also be green. If the center of the 3x3 square is blank, the same location in the output grid will also be blank. The two cells on either side of the center in the output grid are determined by whether or not the two corresponding cells to the left and right of the center square contain a green square. If they do, these cells in the output grid will be green, otherwise they will be blank. The remaining cells in the output grid are always blank.\\\\n10. To form the output grid scan the middle three rows of the input grid. Copy the contents of the middle row of these three to the uppermost row of your output grid. Then, take the contents of the row above the middle row (second of the three rows) and copy it to the middle row of your output grid. Finally, copy the contents of the row below the middle row (third of the three rows) onto the bottom row of your output grid. But, only keep the teal cells while the rest become black.\\\\n11. To generate the output, imagine taking the cross section in the middle of the glass. If the cross section cuts through the 8\\\\\\'s or blue section, fill the corresponding squares with 8\\\\\\'s. If it cuts through the stem, denoted by the 5\\\\\\'s or the gray section, fill the squares with 0\\\\\\'s.\\\\n12. To make the output, colors in the grid were transformed as: black (0) cells become teal (8) if they are bordered by gray cells (from \\\\\\'H\\\\\\' pattern), grey cells (5) become teal (8) only if they on the right side of the pattern and bordered by teal (8), otherwise they become black (0). Teal (8) cells remain as teal (8) if the sum of the cells horizontal and vertical to them are not 0, otherwise they become black (0).\\\\n13. To make the output, you have to form a T-letter shape by using top three raws. Fill the center of the T letter with teal(8) color if it is completely filled in the input. If it is not completely filled with teal color(8) or any part of the center of the \\\\\\'T\\\\\\' is missing then place black color(0) in the center of the \\\\\\'T\\\\\\'.\\\\n14. To make the output, you have to compress all the rows and columns of the input grid into the output grid. Black squares in the input grid become black in the output and teal squares in the input grid also become black in the output. If there is any grey present in the column or row, then the corresponding square in the output grid should be teal. If the entire input row or column is black, then the square in the output should be black regardless of the presence of any other color.\\\\n15. To make the output, you should identify the middle cell of the input cross shaped pattern. This middle cell is either black or teal in the input grid, if the middle cell is black the output grid will be three teal cells on top and six black cells, and if the middle cell is teal in your input grid the upper three cells will be teal colored in the output grid, and of the remaining six cells, the cell that is in the middle of the first row from the bottom will be teal, and the rest will be black.\\\\n16. To achieve the output, you initially need to apply a filtering method to the input grid, ignoring the grey boxes and considering only the teal boxes. The next step is to transform the filtered grid to arrive at the output. The transformation involves dividing the filtered grid into equal 3x3 squares. Each 3x3 segment of the filtered input will correspond to a single box in the output. If the 3x3 segment of the filtered input contains teal boxes, the corresponding output position will have a teal box, otherwise, it will be black. The output grid must then be rotated once in a clockwise direction.\\\\n17. To transform the input grid into the output grid, locate the cells with teal color in the head of the gray T shape. Then place a teal cell in the corresponding position of the output. Place a gray cell in the remaining cells to complete the transformation of the grid. If there is no teal in gray T, all the output grid will be filled with gray cells.\\\\n18. To make the output, the teal cells from the input are scaled down and positioned in the corresponding location in the output grid. The remaining cells in the output grid are left black.\\\\n19. To make the output, we need to focus on the 3x3 grid (starting from the top left corner of the teal shape). If there are teal numbers in the row, it creates a row of teal numbers in the output. Else, it fills the row with black color. Repeat the operation for each of the first 3 rows of that 3x3 grid.\\\\n20. To create the output grid, you have to look at the center of the input\\\\\\'s grey square. Keep in mind that diagonals need not be considered. If there is a teal square in the top center, fill in the whole top row of the output as teal. If there is a teal square in the center, fill in the center square of the output grid as teal. If there is a teal square at the bottom center, fill the bottom center of the output as teal. The rest of the output should remain black.\\\\n21. To make the output, you have to create a new 3x3 grid. The left and right columns of the new grid match the first column of grey cells in the input \\\\\\'H\\\\\\' shape, with the teal cells, if any, at the top. The middle column of the new grid is always black.\\\\n22. To make the output, you have to transform the input by focusing on the \"H\" pattern. The uppermost occurrence of teal in the H\\\\\\'s vertical line should be transformed to the left cell in the top row of output grid. The lowermost teal occurrence from the H\\\\\\'s vertical line should show up in the left cell of the bottom row in output. The horizontal teal line in the \"H\" should be transformed to the top row in the output grid, starting from the center cell. So, if there is only one row of teal, the top row in the output is full teal. If there are two rows of teal, the top and middle rows are teal, and so on. If no teal is present in one of the vertical lines of the \"H\", the output grid will contain only black cells in the corresponding column.\\\\n23. The output grid is formed based on the presence of the smaller rectangle or square in the input formed by number 8 (teal) cells. The top row of the output grid contains number 8 cells if there is number 8 rectangle or square in the top half of the grey rectangle in the input. The middle row of the output grid contains number 8 cells in the middle if there is a number 8 rectangle or square in the middle of the grey rectangle in the input. The bottom row of the output grid will always contain number 0 cells. The number 8 (teal) cells of the output grid are always on the left side. The remaining cells in the output grid will be filled with 0 (black/empty) cells.\\\\n24. To create the output, each row of the input box is verified from top to bottom. If a teal square is found in a row of the input grid, a teal square should be placed in the corresponding location in the top row of the output grid. If there is no teal square in the row of the input grid, fill the corresponding row of the output grid with black. Repeat this for each row of the input until the output grid is filled.\\\\n25. To make the output, you have to count the number of teal squares on each column from the input. For each triple of squares on the columns, if the number of teal on that column is 2, you draw a teal on the same column on the output, in the first row (from top to bottom). If the number of teal on that column is 1, you draw a teal on the same column on the output, in the second row (from top to bottom). If there are no teal squares on the column, you do nothing for that column.\\\\n26. To make the output, examine the presence of 8\\\\\\'s within the 5\\\\\\'s area. If there is a line of 8\\\\\\'s, place an 8 in the top row of the output grid corresponding to its position. If there are 8\\\\\\'s filling beneath the line in the 5\\\\\\'s region, put an 8 in the second row of the output grid corresponding to its position. The third row of the output grid stays black or zero.\\\\n27. To generate the output, take the top, the middle, and the bottom rows of the \\\\\\'H\\\\\\' shape ignoring the greys (treat them as black). For each row construct a new row that consists of the most right teal (if there), a black in the middle and the most left teal (if there). Assemble these rows to get the output grid. The input pattern doesn\\\\\\'t seem to care about the overall input size, or the size of the \\\\\\'H\\\\\\' shape.\\\\n28. The output grid is a compressed version of the grey rectangle in the input grid. Take the part of the grey rectangle that is 3 spaces tall and spans the entire width of the grey rectangle. Then, replace each column of this part that is fully occupied by the grey color with a column of black color. Afterwards, compress each column of the remaining part with teal to a single cell of teal color, and each column of the remaining part without a teal color to a single cell of black color within the output grid.\\\\n29. To get the output from the input follow the steps:  1. You have to identify the square/rectangle made up of teal cells in the input grid. 2. Then you need to compress this square/rectangle into the size of 3x3 in the output grid.  3. To do that, break the square/rectangle into 3 equal vertical parts: left, middle, and right. 4. The left part of the output grid corresponds to the left part of the rectangle/square in the input grid. If there are any teal cells in the left part of input, the entire left part of output will be teal. 5. The middle part of the output grid corresponds to the middle part of the rectangle/square in the input grid. If there are any teal cells in the middle part of input, the middle part of output will be teal. 6. The right part of the output grid corresponds to the right part of the rectangle/square in the input grid. If there are any teal cells in the right part of input, the right part of output will be teal. 7.\\\\n30. The transformation pattern should be such that the output grid contains a 3x3 section corresponding to the center of the input grid. The bottom row of the output is always all zeros. Create the rest of the output by compressing every three left-to-right consecutive cells in the center row(s) of the grey area of the input grid into one cell, which will be in the top row(s) of the output. The rule for compressing three cells into one is as follows: if the middle cell (of the three being compressed) is teal, then the new cell (in the output grid) will be teal. If the middle cell is not teal, then the new cell will be black.\\\\n31. To create the output, you have to check the input grid and count the number of blue squares on the top row, middle row and bottom row of both gray \"L\" shapes. Then put these counts into the corresponding places in the output. If there are no blue squares, the count is 0, represented by a black square.\\\\n32. To make the output, follow these steps: -Make a 3x3 grid. -In the first row, place teal cells in the spots where the vertical grey bar intersects with the teal cells in the center, if at all. If there are more than 3 teal intersections, only consider the topmost 3. The rest of the cells on this row should remain black. -The lower two rows should remain black.\\\\n33. To make the output, you have to take the middle 3x3 square from the input grid (if there isn\\\\\\'t exactly middle, take down and/or right position). then you change all words that are not teal (8) to black (0).\\\\n34. If some grey cell in the \\\\\\'T\\\\\\' are replaced by teal, on the output it forms a rectangle in the top area of the output. The number of teal cells in the output grid is equal to the number of rows filled by teal cells in input grid. The remaining area in the output is filled with black.\\\\n35. To make the output, you have to perform the following steps: 1. Make a 3x3 grid. 2. In the first row (from top to bottom), fill all cells with teal if there is any teal cell in the middle rows of the cross in the input, otherwise leave them black. 3. In the second and third rows, fill all cells with black. 4. In the first column (from left to right), fill all cells with black except the first cell, which remains the same. 5. In the second and third columns, fill all cells with black.\\\\n36. The transformation involves replicating the configuration of the smaller square of the input to the corresponding locations in the 3x3 output grid. The rest of the cells in the output grid are painted black. In the placement of the transformed smaller square, the topmost teal cell will take the top center position of the 3x3 output grid, and then the rest will continue to occupy space downwards, and then to the right.\\\\n37. Each of the 9 cells in the output grid corresponds to a 3x3 cell section of the input grid. To make the output, count the number of teal cells in the corresponding section of the input grid. If there are 5 or more teal cells, output a teal cell. Otherwise, output a black cell.\\\\n38. To make the output, you have to divide the initial shape into 9 equal parts of 3x3 cells. In each part count the number of teal cells. For the place in the final grid corresponding to this part write down: - black, if there are no grey cells - teal, if there are teal cells on the perimeter of this part - black, if the teal cells form a completely filled rectangle.\\\\n39. To make the output, you have to first identify the two compartments formed by the grey cells in the input. Then, check each compartment. If there are teal cells in the compartment then the corresponding row in the output grid should have teal cells at both ends and a black cell in the middle. If there are no teal cells in the compartment, then the corresponding row in the output grid should be empty, i.e., all black. The top compartment corresponds to the top row, and the bottom compartment corresponds to the middle row. The bottom row in the output grid is always empty.\\\\n40. To make the output, you have count the number of teal cells on each row and each column, then map the counts into the grid\\\\\\'s columns and rows respectively. For columns or rows without teal cells, fill with black cells. Only teal cells should appear in the output grid.\\\\n41. The transformation involves reducing the size of the H or I shape and recording its fill status. In the 3x3 output grid, the middle square is always black. For the each of the top, left, and right squares in the output: if the corresponding arm of the H or I has at least one teal pixel, make the square teal, else make it black. The bottom square is always black.\\\\n42. The transformation requires preserving the existing teal footprint from the input but scaling it down to fit in a 3x3 grid. In other words, each teal box becomes a 1x1 box in the output. The position of the teal shapes in the 3x3 grid is preserved. If there is no teal box corresponding to the position in the input grid, it becomes black in the output.\\\\n43. To create the output, you should focus on the teal area in the centre of the teardrop shape. Create a grid equal to the width of this teal area (but not the height) with a height of 3. Fill this with teal at the top and black at the bottom two parts. If the bottom part of the teal area is not filled out completely, fill in those missing grid parts of the output grid with black starting from the middle. Thus, you reduce the teardrop shape to a simplified representation consisting of teal and black blocks in 3 rows.\\\\n44. In the conversion between the input grid and the output, consider a 3x3 box in the center of the input grid. The color of the center cells in the output grid depends on the presence of teal in the center cells of the input grid.   In terms of order, in the first row of the output grid, the first cell corresponds to the center of the input grid, the second cell corresponds to the right of the center, and the third cell corresponds to the left of the center.   In the second and third rows, the cells will be black if there isn\\\\\\'t any teal color in the corresponding positions of the input grid. If there is teal color then they will be teal in the output as well.\\\\n45. To make the output, the following steps have to be maintained- Between two horizontal line of grey cells, for each column, count the number of teal cells. In the output grid, the first row represents the count of the first column, the second row the middle column and the third row the last column. Here the teal is represented with the number 8 and the grey with the number 5. If there are no teals in a column then the cell in the corresponding row in the output grid will be black.\\\\n46. The transformation from input to output is essentially compressing the broader pattern into a 3x3 grid and simplifying the colors. Each row in the output corresponds to the thirds of the input grid (top third, middle third, bottom third). The simplified colors in the output: If there are teal cells in the section, those cells in the output are marked as teal. If there are only grey cells in the section, those cells in the output are marked as black.\\\\n47. To make the output, we create a 3x3 grid. We identify the vertical arm of the cross, then the output grid is created from top to bottom by checking each row. If the row is entirely gray, then we fill in the corresponding row in the output with teal cells. However, if the row is not entirely gray and contains teal cells, we fill in the corresponding row in the output grid with black cells on the left and right, while the center is a teal cell. If the row is entirely black, then we fill in the corresponding row in the output with all black cells.\\\\n48. For this pattern, the process goes as follows:   In the first output row, for each output block, count the number of columns in the input that have at least one corresponding teal block in the row that correlates with the output block.   For the second and third row of the output, the blocks should all be empty regardless of the input.  So for example, if the top row of the input grid has three columns with at least one teal block, the first row of output would be [8 8 8]. If the input grid has two columns with teal blocks, the output would still be [8 8 8] (since the maximum is 3). If the input grid has just one column with a teal block, the output would be [8 0 0]. And if the input grid has no columns with teal blocks, the output would be [0 0 0]. The second and third rows of the output are always [0 0 0].\\\\n49. To make the output, look at the centermost cluster of teal cells in the input. Copy these cells and paste starting from the top row at the center of the output grid, moving left to right. If any row is empty, just fill it with black cells. If the cluster of teal cells does not fit in the 3x3 grid (exceeds one row), place the exceeding cells by continuing the fill on the next row from left to right, until all cells from the cluster are placed or the output grid is filled.\\\\n50. To make the output, you need to read the pattern of the teal squares within the grey U in the input and translate it to the 3x3 grid. Always put the teal cells at the exact coordinates in the output as they are in the grey block in the input. Add three columns equal to the number of blocks in the \\\\\\'U\\\\\\' shape width. If there is no teal cell on a given position, fill the position in the output with black If no grey cell above fits into the 3x3 output grid don\\\\\\'t consider it.\\\\n51. To make the output, consider the middle cells of the grey \"U\"-shaped line, then take the teal cells that are lined up vertically with these grey ones. Fill the output grid so that the teal cells that match with the higher grey cells are placed the upper row of the output grid, and similarly, for the teal cells that match with the lower grey cells go to the lower row of the output grid. Finally, the remaining black cells inside the \"U\", that are lined up horizontally with the middle grey cells of the \"U\", go to the middle row of the output grid. If there are no teal cells inside the \"U\", then fill with black cells.\\\\n52. To make the output, shrink the input grid down. Look only on the teal squares within the grey \"H\", and translate their positions onto the 3x3 grid. The rest of the grid squares in the output which do not hold the teal squares, should be painted black.\\\\n53. To make the output, you have to find the location of the teal square in relationship with the surrounding gray rectangle in the form of a 3x3 representation. If the teal square is in the center, the corresponding position in the output would be a teal square in the center with black surrounding it. If the teal square is at the top, the corresponding position in the output would be a teal square at the top with two horizontal black lines below it. The pattern follows a similar transformation depending on the position of the teal square in the input. If there are no teal squares, the output is a black 3x3 grid.\\\\n54. To make the output, you have to create a 3x3 grid. If there is a line made with teal pixels (number 8) in the upper area of the input figure, the upper row of the output should be filled with teal pixels (number 8). If there are teal lines in the middle and lower areas of the figure, the action should be repeated for the middle and lower rows of the output, respectively, placing teal pixels when there are teal lines and not placing any color, represented by the number 0, when there are no teal lines.\\\\n55. To make the output, you have to track the quadrant with the blue cells in the input grid. The corresponding quadrant in the output should be filled with blue cells, while the rest remain black. For example, if blue cells are found in the bottom left quadrant of the input grid, then the top right quadrant of the output grid is filled with blue cells.\\\\n56. To make the output, take the middle top 3 boxes;  if there\\\\\\'s a teal box (represented by the number 8) in the left and right boxes, make the top row in the output teal boxes;  if there\\\\\\'s a teal box in any three of the middle top boxes, but not both the extreme right and left middle boxes, make the top row have two in the left teal boxes in the output;  if none of the above apply, make the top row black boxes.  Next, take the middle 3 rows from the input;  if there\\\\\\'s a teal box in the first row and last box of the middle three rows, make a teal box in the middle of the second row in the output;  if there\\\\\\'s a teal box in the last row and first box of the middle three rows, make a teal box in the left of the second row in the output;  if none of the above apply, make the second row black boxes in the output.  Finally, for the last row in the output, it\\\\\\'s always black boxes.  This transformation should give you the output from the given input.\\\\n57. To make the output, you need to consider the existence and positioning of the teal squares in the T-shape in the input. You will create a 3x3 grid that features a vertical column of teal squares on the left-most side if there is a row of teal squares across the top of the T-shape, regardless of the presence of teal squares anywhere else.   You will also create a horizontal row of teal squares in the top-most row of the 3x3 grid if there is a column of teal squares down the center of the T-shape, and those teal squares don\\\\\\'t extend to the base of the T-shape in the same cell width as the rest of the vertical arm of the T-shape.  The remaining squares in the 3x3 grid should be black.\\\\n58. To make the output, take the middle section of the \"H\" (where the teal blocks are located) and reduce its size to 1 unit thick while maintaining the overall shape and position. Then place it in the middle of a 3x3 grid. The rest of the boxes in the 3x3 grid should be black.\\\\n59. To produce the output grid, imagine the second region as a matrix and ignore everything else. In the output grid, if there is a teal cell in the second region of the input grid, indicate it by painting the corresponding cell teal. The rest of the cells in the output grid should be black. For determination of the correspondence between cells in the input and output, you may consider the task as the following: take a snapshot of the central rock-paper-scissors emblem and paint the cells black where there are blue cells in the snapshot. The cells in the output grid where there are teal cells in the snapshot are painted teal.\\\\n60. To make the output, locate the \\\\\\'T\\\\\\' shape in the input.  The output depends on the placement of the teal squares inside the \\\\\\'T\\\\\\' stem. Fill the top row of the output grid with teal squares if the \\\\\\'T\\\\\\' stem is centrally filled with teal squares. The rest of the upper half of the output remains black. If there are no teal squares inside the \\\\\\'T\\\\\\' stem, the entire output grid is filled with black.\\\\n61. The transformation is a summary of the rectangle of number 8 located in the path of 5. In output grid, the top row corresponds to the first row of 8\\\\\\'s from the input, the middle row corresponds to any middle rows of 8\\\\\\'s, and the bottom row corresponds to the last row of 8\\\\\\'s. If an entire row of the rectangle consists only of 8\\\\\\'s, then the corresponding output row is entirely 8\\\\\\'s, otherwise it is filled with zeros.\\\\n62. To make the output, count the number of turquoise cells in each of the three sections of the I-shape (top, middle, bottom) separately. Then place these counts in a 3x3 grid corresponding to their section. For the sections that do not contain any turquoise cell, fill those corresponding places in the 3x3 grid with a black cell. Moving from top to bottom in the input, corresponding cells are placed from left to right, bottom to top in the output.\\\\n63. To get the output grid, you create a 3x3 grid where the number of rows and columns filled with teal (8) in the output corresponds to the number of consecutive rows and columns filled with teal (8) in the input from the top and from the left side of the grid, respectively. The rest of the cells in the output grid are black (0).\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "After analyzing the rules, they can be categorized into eight distinct categories based on their similarities:\n\nCategory 1: Rules that involve transforming the input grid based on the position of teal cells within a specific shape or pattern.\n- Rules: 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 13, 15, 17, 23, 24, 32, 34, 35, 36, 39, 41, 43, 47, 49, 51, 52, 53, 55, 57, 58, 60.\n- Synthesized Rule: To create the output, identify the specific shape or pattern in the input grid.

For each category, synthesize the rules into a single, specific rule that combines the ideas of all rules in that category, while clearly differentiating it from the other categories.\\\\nThe new rule should be as specific as possible, following the format of the given rules.\\\\nThe new rule should be applicable without any information from the original rules - i.e. it should be standalone.\\\\n\\\\nRules:\\\\n1. To make the output, you should identify the column where a red cell is present in the first square. From this column, move towards the left by filling the cells similarly as they appear moving below the red cell in the first square till you hit a zero row. Do the same for the second square by filling the cells similarly as they appear moving above the red cell in the second square till you hit a zero row. Ensure to maintain the pattern of colors of cells even after meeting a red cell downwards in the first square and upwards in the second square.\\\\n2. To make the output, mirror the rectangles in both halves along the middle row of each half. This will result in a mirrored rectangle beneath the rectangle in the upper half and above the rectangle in the lower half. In case the mirrored squares are already green, change them to red. All other squares remain unchanged.\\\\n3. To make the output, you have to transform the 5x5 squares by copying the coloured cells from the squares in the bottom to the same positions in the corresponding squares in the top until you meet a black cell. After the transformation, the 5x5 squares from the top stay the same whereas the 5x5 squares at the bottom will have alternating patterns of green, red, and black cells.\\\\n4. In the transformation, the top and bottom rows of green squares continue to expand downward and upward respectively, in each row, until reaching the middle row - the squares expand towards the red squares which do not move. The red squares also expand in both sides horizontally until the last square in the row where the red squares are.\\\\n5. To transform the input grid into the output grid, first identify the location of the red square in the green rectangle. Then, from the position of the red square, change the color of all the squares to the left (including the red square) into a red square, and keep changing the color of squares to the left until you reach another green square. Similar changes should be done below the rectangle also. When you reach black cells, stop changing.\\\\n6. To make the output, look at the input grid\\\\\\'s green areas. If there\\\\\\'s a red square anywhere in the rectangle, fill the entire row above the red square with green squares in the output grid. Also, place a horizontal line of red squares below the green squares at the position corresponding to the line below the red square in the input grid. If there\\\\\\'s another green rectangle below the red square, copy the green rectangle including the red square downwards until a black cell is encountered. All other areas outside the green rectangles become pure black in the output.\\\\n7. To make the output, you need to mirror the upper half of the input grid vertically to the bottom. Particularly, you should replace bottom half of the grid with a flipped version of the top half, keeping the center line (full of empty cells) as a mirror line. Repeat the outlier (Red blocks) that exist in the top part of the grid to the mirrored part at the bottom. The green blocks that was in the bottom part before replacement, should be copied and added to the right side of the green blocks in both parts. Thus, transforming the outliers from encircling the center of the green blocks at the top and bottom parts, to positioning at the center of both green blocks horizontally. At the end all the empty cells to the right including the outliers remain the same.\\\\n8. To make the output, you have to start with the an empty copy of the original input grid. Then, you place green squares to the left of the grid starting on the red square and moving to the left until you hit a border or another obstacle. After filling each row, repeat the same operation until reaching border or another obstacle downwards from the second red square and go back upwards again after reaching the bottom. Continue until covering the entire object with the green color. The red square is extended to the border of the object on the opposite side.\\\\n9. To make the output, you need to start from the corner and proceed towards the middle of the green sequence, filling the black area with green cells until you hit a red cell in the sequence. Once the red cell is encountered, the filling process is reversed - it should go from the middle of the sequence towards the corner, filling the black area with red cells. Continue in the other direction until you finish the sequence, again filling the black area with green cells. On the other side of the grid, perform the opposite - first fill with red cells, then with green cells. If there is no red cell in a sequence, fill the area with green cells only.\\\\n10. To produce the output grid, a path of green cells starting from the red cell is extended towards the empty space in the lower right part of the grid. The path consists of diagonal, horizontal, and vertical movements and it extends until it hits the bottom of the grid. The red cell is moved along the path. In all other respects, the output grid is the same as the input grid.\\\\n11. To make the output grid, we need to reflect the top bar over the entire grid. i.e., a reflected image appears underneath the original object, with the top of the original and its reflected image meeting at the line of reflection, which is the bottom of the input grid. Do the same for the red cells. The red and green cells get mirrored onto the rest of the grid.\\\\n12. To make the output you have to start from the red blocks and move along the rows from both top and bottom directions. Paint the row with green if it intersects the silhouette from the input grid. At the end of the row, you should paint the whole silhouette down to the red blocks.\\\\n13. To transform the input into the output, we first identify the red cell. This red cell then \\\\\\'infects\\\\\\' all of the green cells in its row and column, both in the rectangle it belongs to and in the other rectangle. The infected cells turn red and continue to propagate the infection to other green cells. The infection continues until there are no more green cells in the same row or column in both rectangles.\\\\n14. To make the output, you have to fill in the empty blocks from the top line down to the bottom line with green, and the block that starts the filling process is the red number. However, you always start with the block that is adjacent to the left side of the red block. You stop when you hit the red block of the starting block of the bottom line. When the red block is turned green, you may stop until you reach a block that is already green.\\\\n15. To make the output, a green path (cell by cell) must be drawn from the red cell in the upper rectangle to the red cell in the rectangle below, going from left to right. The path follows the right and alongside the rectangular margins. Furthermore, after the path reaches the lower rectangle, it continues along the left side of this rectangle to complete a full rectangular loop around the central green cells. Essentially, any green cells that are horizontally or vertically adjacent to the red or another green cell are changed into green.\\\\n16. To make the output, a copy of the visible part of the green form is created and gradually moved from its original position to the opposite corner. While moving, the green squares, including the substituted red square, overwrite any existing black squares on their path. The original figure also remains intact.\\\\n17. The transformation involves two main steps. The first step is to fill all the black cells below the top green line until the bottom green line, in the first five columns, with green and red cells that reflect the top green line (mirroring it). The second step involves filling the black cells in the last column above the bottom green line in a way that reflects the bottom green line upwards (mirroring it). The colors of the cells are preserved in both steps.\\\\n18. The transformation is made by replacing the green squares under the diagonal of the grid into red squares based on the initial position of the single red square in each rectangle. The single red square from the top left rectangle determines the column where the red squares will start, while the single red square from the bottom right rectangle determines the line where the red squares will fill up to. The red squares fill each of the lines up to the current diagonal line.\\\\n19. To make the output, you have to stretch or expand the green squares that are four squares apart from the red square in all directions (up, down, left, right). The green squares stretch until they meet the edge of the grid or another square. If they meet another square that is not black, they should replace that square.\\\\n20. To make the output, the transformation follows these steps: 1. For each green (3) patch, continue it diagonally to the bottom right until it hits the \\\\\\'wall\\\\\\'. It should replace any black pixels in its path. The green line should only stop when it hits another green pixel or the wall of the grid.  2. If the green color hits a red color (2), that red should repeat diagonally down to the right, overwriting any green color it hits. Again, this should only stop if it hits the wall of the grid.  In summary, the pattern extends the green and red colors diagonally from their initial square patches until they hit the \\\\\\'wall\\\\\\'. The red overwrites any green it encounters in its path.\\\\n21. To make the output, firstly, find the rows that contain at least one green cell and extend these rows from the first green cell to the end on the right side filling them with green cells. When a red color is reached, then fill with red cells until the end of the row. Next, for the rows that don\\\\\\'t contain any green cell, leave them as they are, in black.\\\\n22. To make the output, you need to follow two steps:  1. Expand the block of green cells (containing the red cell) on both sides to reach the black gap. It should expand until it hit another color or if it cannot expand anymore. The black cells directly beneath or on top of the expanded green cells should also turn into green. 2. The process above will form a step-like structure. Fill in the steps by copying the colors from step above. So, green cells expand horizontally, and red cell expands horizontally and vertically. You should not overwrite the existing cells with new ones. Once the red line-cells hit another color or if they cannot expand anymore, they stop. This should result in a red line surrounded by green cells in the output.\\\\n23. To make the output, you must follow these steps: 1. Any cell that aligns vertically with the orange cell within the top left quadrant should be shaded the same color as that cell (orange) from the tip of the green square in the top left quadrant to the tip of the green square in the bottom right quadrant. 2. However, if a green square exists in the same column within the bottom left quadrant, extend the color fill only to the tip of the corresponding green square within the bottom left quadrant. The same rule applies if a green square exists in the same row within the top right quadrant. 3. The color fill should overflow into the black space above the top left quadrant and below the bottom right quadrant but should not exceed the bounds of the grid. 4. Preserve green squares within the top right and bottom left quadrants as they were in the input grid.\\\\n24. To make the output, you have to begin at the red pixel in the teal block, then convert the teal pixels to the right into its red starting at the red pixel down to the middle part of the array, and continue the filling of red on the left side of the block from the middle going up. This process should be done for both of the upper and lower teal blocks. The red pixels should form an \"L\" shape inside the teal blocks.\\\\n25. To make the output, you have to draw the path of green 3s from the top left to the right-middle. Each unit square surrounded by the green 3s should be filled with green 3s, regardless of whether it used to be empty or had a number in it. The point where the red 2 is located in the path should be an initiation point to a line of red 2s vertically till the bottom grid.\\\\n26. To make the output, you have to fill the black frame with green blocks, keeping the original pattern in place. The pattern will be the same except now it is incorporating more green blocks in the frame. The red square initially placed to the side of the segment with green blocks in the black frame moves towards the far end of the row and the black blocks next to green blocks also change to green until they reach until the last four columns of the row. The rest of the row stays the same as the input. For subsequent identical rows, the red block moves one block to the right each time until it reaches the fourth last column and all the black blocks in front of it in that row change to green. After that if there are more such identical rows in the input, the pattern repeats. The rows that are entirely black remain the same in the output.\\\\n27. To make the output, you have to identify the location of the projection (the blue square, number 2) in the long rectangles of green squares. The projection then expands in the direction of the empty space in the grid until it hits the edge of the grid or the center line where the two rectangles are connected. The remaining green squares in the upper rectangle are kept the same. Throughout this process, the rest of grid remains unchanged.\\\\n28. In the transformation, the red rectangle duplicates outwards in four directions until it reaches the border of its container (the green rectangle). Each step to the right, up, left, or down takes place simultaneously, meaning that the red rectangle will grow equally in all cardinal directions until it reaches the wall of its containing green rectangle.\\\\n29. The transformation involves expanding the single red cell on the left band vertically up and down until it hits a black cell or the boundary of the grid. For the green band on the right, the transformation includes an extra step prior to the red cell expansion: the green cells also expand to the right until they hit a black cell or the boundary of the grid.\\\\n30. To transform the input grid into the output grid, you need to fill all the black squares on the right side of the red square in each rectangle to be the same color as the rectangle. Repeat this process row by row until reaching the black line. For all the black squares on the left side of the red square, fill them with green regardless of the rectangle size, except for the singles row of black squares on the most left of the upper rectangle. After reaching the black line that separates the two rectangles, perform the same operation, but this time, the squares that are filled with the red color should extend beyond the rectangle.\\\\n31. To make the output, you have to copy the square containing the red box at the top of the grid, and paste it below to the middle of the grid until it covered the previous bottom square. In addition to that you will have to continue pasting down until the pasted squares reach the size of the original square. The red square in the pasted squares will shift one step to the right for every new square added. After having a pasted square the same size as the original top square, the original top square will be copied to the locations below the pasted squares, to until the grid is filled. The number of black columns to the right side will be kept consistent throughout the transformation process.\\\\n32. To make the output, you have to mirror the top left box filled with green cells to the bottom left corner and mirror the bottom right box filled with green cells to the top right corner. Besides that, replace the original red cell with a red line extending horizontally to the right, ending at the grid edge. The replaced red cells\\\\\\' empty vertical spaces are filled with green cells, making a green box in the corners where the red lines start.\\\\n33. To transform the grid from input to output, detect the row with a single red square, then fill any black square to the left of that row with green until it reaches a row with red. Repeat this same operation to any black square below the row until it reaches another red square. This transforms the input to the output. So essentially, fill black spaces in the area between two red squares with green.\\\\n34. To make the output, you have to replace the green squares with red squares down and to the right from the red square, stopping when hitting the edge of the bar. The top figures substitutes downwards and the bottom one does so upwards.\\\\n35. To make the output, you have to fill down and right from the block of green squares until you reach a black square or the edge of the grid. The red square also expands right and down in the same manner, overwriting any green squares.\\\\n36. To make the output, you have to fill the green strip towards the left side, until you hit the red square. Once you hit the red square, you fill the entire strip to the left, all the way to the edge of the grid with red squares. Continue the process from right to left in each strip replacing green squares to red squares until you reach at each red square in each strip.Hence, the green squares on the left of red one are replaced by red squares and all green squares on the right remain unchanged.\\\\n37. To make the output, you have to extend the area covered by red pixels in the smaller squares outwards over the green pixels, until they meet a black pixel or the border of the large square. Alphabetically, this would mean extending the red and the green pixels of each square outwards in each direction until encountering a black pixel. In other words, red and green cells are dragged along the row or column until reaching a black cell or the edge of the large square.\\\\n38. To make the output, you have to follow these steps: 1. Find the red square in the top strip and replace all black squares to the left of it (in the same row) with green squares. 2. Do the same for the row containing the red square in the bottom strip. 3. Now find the right most green square in each strip, fill all black squares to the right of it (up to and including the square under the red square) with green squares. Repeat this for all rows in the strip. 4. Finally, replace the black squares to the left and under the right most green square in both strips with red squares. But, the red squares should be filled only up to the level with the original red square from step 1. Also, the red squares should not overflow into the black borders of the image. In other words, a red square should only replace a black square that\\\\\\'s between the right most green square in its row and the original red square, including the black squares situated in the same vertical line as the original red square.\\\\n39. To make the output grid, first record the position from the top left of the grid where the red cell is located in the input. Then, starting from this position, continue transforming the cells to the right and below to be the same color as the cell until you hit a black cell or boundary. The top quadrant always has priority over the bottom for color transformation.\\\\n40. To make the output, you have to replace black squares with green squares starting from the square that faces the red square inside the green block. Continue the operation along the line between the two green blocks towards the outer edge of the grid. The process repeats for both green blocks. Red squares replace the green squares along the black line from the point which is closest to red against the direction to the outer edge of the grid, while leaving two squares on the edge of the green block as green.\\\\n41. To make the output, you have to replicate the single red cell to the right until it hits a green cell or the edge of the grid. This action should be performed for each line containing the red cell. As a result, the red line in the output grid will be stretched to the right from the initial position of the red dot. All the non-stretched parts of the input grid should remain the same in the output.\\\\n42. To make the output, you need to shift the blocks of green cells towards each other while maintaining the line of green cells in between. Start from the row of the red cell and keep shifting the above rows until you reach the row where the red cell in the bottom block reached in its upwards shift and paint everything to its right with the color of the filled square. Keep in mind that the bottom row of the top block and the top row of the bottom block must remain filled.\\\\n43. - Firstly, for each green cell in the input grid, if there are green cells both above it and to its left, it should remain green in the output grid. If it is a red cell, then red cells are extended to the right up to the point where there are no more green cells above it.  - Then for each cell in the input grid, if there are green cells both below it and to its right, it should remain green in the output grid. If at least one of the neighboring cell is missing, it should become a black cell.If it is a red cell, then red cells are extended to the left up to the point where there are no more green cells below it.   - The process appears to extend cells vertically first and then horizontally in the output grid, forming a composed pattern from the original top left to bottom right stair pattern and bottom left to top right stair pattern.\\\\n44. To get the output, extend the continuous line of green pixels starting from the red pixel in the same direction until it reaches the edge of the grid. Repeat the same pattern below the red pixel. The remaining black pixels should remain unchanged to get the output grid.\\\\n45. To make the output, you have to do the following steps:   1. Start from the red block in the green square. 2. Replace all black blocks directly to the right of the red block until the grid\\\\\\'s edge or another green block is encountered by green blocks. 3. Add a column of red blocks directly to the right of the new green blocks.  You should repeat these steps for both green squares.\\\\n46. To make the output, you have to fill in the green cells from the right end to the central red cell line by line from top to bottom for the upper green grid, and from bottom to top for the lower green grid.\\\\n47. To make the output, from the leftmost blue pixel, fill all the green pixels to the right and down until the grid border or until encountering a non-green pixel across both horizontal and vertical direction. Do the same thing for the line at the bottom of the grid but in this case start filling upwards.\\\\n48. To make the output, you proceed in the following way: - For the rectangle located at the top, fill all cells to its right until you either reach a black cell down below or the fourth cell from the left of the rectangle located at the bottom. - For the rectangle located at the bottom, fill all cells to its right until you either reach a black cell up above or the fourth last cell from the right of the top rectangle.   Then, - Inside both of the rectangles, change the entire row containing the red cell to red. This changed row, extending from the first green cell in the rectangle to the last green cell filled on the right, creates a red line.\\\\n49. To transform the grid, start at each red cell and fill in all contiguous green cells moving upwards and to the left until reaching either the grid\\\\\\'s edge or a black cell. This expansion should include the red cell\\\\\\'s original position. After expanding, retain the original shape within the new larger shape - this means that any cells that were originally black within the new larger figure will remain black.\\\\n50. To make the output, you have to expand each colored area (excluding black) to the right until it hits another colored area or the edge of the grid. The new strips created by this expansion should have the same color as the strip that caused the expansion. A colored strip would not expand past any other colored area. However, if there\\\\\\'s a different color within the original vertical strip, the strip of a different color would expand as well until it hits another colored area or the edge of the grid; or if it hits the strip of the original color.\\\\n51. To make the output, you have to slide each of the green squares towards the red cell until the first black cell. The final configuration will look like green squares filling almost the whole grid except the borders. Each of the green squares will still have one red cell with the difference that the red colors will now fill downwards from red cell\\\\\\'s initial position to the end of the green square.\\\\n52. To transform the input into output, the rule seems to involve filling in green squares to the left of the singular red square (if such exists), and then \"moving\" the shape of the picture to fill in the rest of the black background on the right with green pixels. This \"moving\" rule takes the form of checking the row of the lower rectangle corresponding to the row in the upper rectangle. The green pixels are replicated from upper row to side of lower rectangle and vice versa. This formula is applied to every row.\\\\n53. The transformation is vertically mirroring the green rectangle that contains a red cell whereas its bottom border does not get transformed and simply extends in black cells to the second rectangle. Therefore, a single red cell is mirrored into multiple red cells which correspond to the number of columns in the green rectangle containing red cells in the input grid. The bottom green rectangle is inserted into the mirrored rectangle at the corresponding positions in the input grid. This pattern repeats for all the cells in the grid.\\\\n54. To make the output, you have to \"move\" the left green square rightwards until it comes in contact with the right green box. The distinct red square should be moved together with its corresponding green square such that the red box always remains in the green square. The greened squares reached on moving should be replaced by black squares.\\\\n55. To generate the output, rotate the colored shapes around a vertical axis passing through its center of mass. After the first rotation, the shape is reflected along the left margin, and it is reflected upward after the second rotation. The empty cells remain unchanged.\\\\n56. To make the output, copy the four rows above the red cell on the top and beyond the red cell on the bottom side to the side of the mirrored \\\\\\'L\\\\\\'. This includes only green cells. The single red cell in the mirrorified \\\\\\'L\\\\\\' shape is extended until it reaches the edge of the grid on the right. All remaining cells are left green. The other cells remain black.\\\\n57. To make the output, keep the left part of the strip as is, fill the black squares to the right with a sequence of green squares that have the same width as the left strip until it hits a column of green squares on the far right. For the red squares, expand the red squares into a vertical strip that lines up with the left strip. In other words, the pattern expands the color patterns to the right, overwriting black squares, until they hit another color.\\\\n58. To generate the output, carry out the following steps:  1. Identify the column position of the \\\\\\'2\\\\\\' cell in the top rectangle (index from 1 instead of 0).  2. The 3\\\\\\'s pattern should be expanded to the right covering the same number of columns as the identified value in step 1 and keeping the original boundaries.  3. The row containing the \\\\\\'2\\\\\\' cell in the bottom rectangle should be filled with \\\\\\'2\\\\\\'s, except the first cell which should be \\\\\\'3\\\\\\'.  4. For the rows below the filled \\\\\\'2\\\\\\' row, all the cells that are occupied by \\\\\\'3\\\\\\' in the preceding row should also be occupied by \\\\\\'3\\\\\\' in the current row.  5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until reach the bottommost row of the bottom rectangle.\\\\n59. To make the output, you have to extend the smaller square till it hits the edge of the large square by filling the cells that it extends over with the same horizontal sequence of cells of the smaller square. If a cell of the smaller square is red, extend this red cell horizontally until it hits the edge of the square. The rest cells which are not part of the square should remain black.\\\\n60. To make the output, you need to fill all the green cells in the grid, except the cells in the figures, so that a mirror image of the figures is produced in a diagonal line from the original row and column. Replace the green cell in the mirror image with a red cell.\\\\n61. To make the output, follow these steps: 1. Identify if the green lines are at the top of the grid or at the bottom. 2. If the green lines are at the top, slide them downward until they touch the bottom of the grid. Slide the red pixel with the corresponding green lines. 3. If the green lines are at the bottom, slide them upwards until they touch the top of the grid. Slide the red pixel with the corresponding green lines. 4. Keep the remaining parts of the grid as they are. This transformation rule is valid as long as the size of input equals the size of the output. Holds true even for larger or smaller grid sizes.\\\\n62. To make the output, you have to:  1. Identify the row where the red cell is located within the green rectangle. 2. Replace every cell from the top until reaching that row with green cells as long as it was not initially black. When you confront a row with black cells for the first time, it means you have crossed over from the top rectangle to the bottom one: you should then continue filling with green cells, but not until you reach the red cell again. 3. The rows which include and are below the one where the red cell is located should remain the same as in the input. Overall, this pattern fills the area on top of the red cell with green cells in both rectangles.\\\\n63. To obtain the output, identify the column with the red cell in the upper region, and replace the entire column with red cells up to, but not including, the first black cell or the edge of the grid, whichever comes first. Subsequently, trace a path of green cells diagonally down and to the left, from the red cell to the first black cell which meets the path, replacing all cells in this path with red cells. Continue this red path from this point horizontally to the right until meeting the first black cell or border of the grid, replacing these green cells with red ones as well.

For each category, synthesize the rules into a single, specific rule that combines the ideas of all rules in that category, while clearly differentiating it from the other categories.\\\\nThe new rule should be as specific as possible, following the format of the given rules.\\\\nThe new rule should be applicable without any information from the original rules - i.e. it should be standalone.\\\\n\\\\nRules:\\\\n1. To make the output, you have to draw a hollow square around each colored symbol. The size of the square is proportional to the distance from the symbol to the nearest grid edge. The color of the square matches the color of the symbol.\\\\n2. To make the output, you have to find the two non-empty dots in the input grid and then fill in a bounding box around them. The box is mirrored along a central line, but does not include that line. The boxes should contain an outlined arrow - made up by color of each dot in the input, pointing towards the right direction.\\\\n3. To make the output, you have to expand the 3x3 patches to a 5x5 grid. In the expanded form, the color occupies the middle row and column as well as the border of the 5x5 patch, while the central 3x3 square is filled with other color squares forming a horizontal and vertical line.\\\\n4. To make the output, you have to create two rectangles with the colors found in the input grid. The rectangle corresponding to the color found higher (or to the left if the colors are at the same height) in the grid is always on the left. The rectangles have their colored cells are at the sides (border) and black cells in the middle, emulating the picture of a hollow rectangle. The size of these rectangles is consistent, staying the same across different inputs.\\\\n5. Considering the spot the colored cells are, draw a diamond of the same color but on a larger scale. The larger scale depends on the color, with the number equivalent to the radius plus 1. For instance, the grey cell, with number 5, becomes a diamond where the longest row contains 5 grey cells. The teal diamond will have 8 cells in the longest row. The diamond is positioned in the center of the colored pixel in the input and is contained within the limits of the grid. Fill the rest with black cells.\\\\n6. The transformation of the grid involves taking the location of the colored node and creating a diamond-shaped object around it. Starting from the original color point (for blue and teal), extend one point up, down, left, and right using the same colored point. Then fill the next layer with colored points to make a diamond of size 3x3. The center color is kept black to create a hollow diamond. The single blue node transforms into a blue diamond and the single teal node transforms into a teal diamond. The diamond shape is inscribed within a square of 3x3 nodes. So the output contains a blue diamond and a teal diamond at the locations the single nodes were respectively placed in the input. If the initial colored point is only one node away from the edge, the diamond shape is clipped and only displays a triangular half.\\\\n7. To make the output, you have to generate a pattern in the shape of a diamond using the color cells that were in the input grid. The diamond shape has four edges: the top and bottom edges are made up of two colored cells, while the left and right edges are made up of five colored cells. For the central part of the diamond (between the left and right edges), the scheme alternates rows with only one colored cell at each end and rows with colored cells except at the very center. The position of each diamond in the grid corresponds to the location of each colored cell in the input grid.\\\\n8. To create the output grid, draw 2x2 squares of the color identified in the input grid on the upper left and right corner. Afterward, draw the squares in 5x2 size below both upper squares, in which the cells are filled with color identified in the input grid, except the second top row, that should be left as black cells, acting as a space. Repeat this step once, with the size of each square is 2x2 and completely filled with color. The space between these two colored squares is filled with black cells.\\\\n9. The transformation process involves surrounding the number(s) from the input grid with the same number to create a square-like shape or ring of that number. There should be equal distribution of this number on each side, while maintaining the integrity of the original box/boxes from the input grid. In other words, this transformation process maps the number-filled box/boxes from the input grid to square-like shape or ring of that number in the output grid. If there are two numbers in the input, the squares should be adjacent to each other with the leftmost number from the input appearing on the left in the output (and same for the right).\\\\n10. The transformation involves creating a diamond shape of 4 pixels height around the pixel in the input grid, keeping the diamond center the same as original color. The diamond will be created using the color of the pixel in the input grid. The pixel at the center of the diamond takes the colour which comes after the original color according to this sequence, considering only the colors that appeared in the examples - {2 (red), 5 (grey), 8 (teal)}. For instance, if the color is red (2) in the input, the center pixel will be grey (5) in the output. If the color is grey (5) in the input, the center pixel will be teal (8) in the output. If the color is teal (8) in the input, the center pixel will become red (2) in the output. The rest of the grid which does not contain the diamond remains the same as the input.\\\\n11. The transformation involves drawing a colored square around the colored pixel in the input grid. This square includes the position of the colored pixel, extends three positions to the left and three positions to the right of it. The colored pixel position is in the middle of top and bottom side of these squares. The color of the colored pixel is the color of the square. The square is filled in such a way that there is a cross in the middle, the horizontal line of the cross being the same color as the square, and the vertical line of the cross being black.\\\\n12. To make the output, you have to create an outline of a \\\\\\'plus\\\\\\' sign shape from the position of the individual colored cell in the input grid, and fill it up with the same color as the colored cell. The filled shape should be centered on the colored cell and extend out 3 cells in all four directions: up, down, left, and right. For locations where the \"plus\" signs of different colors intersect, keep the color of the \"plus\" sign that was created first.\\\\n13. To make the output, you take each color dot and create a 3x5 rectangle in their respective color. The rectangle consists of three columns and five rows. The center column is empty, and the two columns on either side are filled with the color of the dot. The dot itself becomes the middle dot of the middle row in the rectangle. The rectangles are positioned exactly in the center of the grid.\\\\n14. To make the output, you have to create a diamond shape radiating from the colored points. For a colored square located at a distance n from top and m from bottom, create a diamond with an edge of length (n+m). The edges of the diamond are parallel to the edges of the grid. The diamond is filled with the same color as the point, with the exception of center square becoming black. Do this for each colored point. For multiple colored points in the same row, their diamonds overlap creating an elongated shape with a central black line.\\\\n15. To transform the input grid into the output grid, do the following:  -Identify the colored cells in the input grid (look for cells with values other than zero). -After identifying the colored cells, draw a diamond shape centered at the colored cell\\\\\\'s location, with the same color as the colored cell. -The diamond should be oriented such that two of its points touch the top and bottom rows. -The size of the diamond shape elongates. -The remaining cells are black.\\\\n16. Transform the input by creating a diamond pattern around the colored cell. The color of the diamond pattern should match that of the colored cell in the input. The diamond pattern should be formed such that the colored cell is in the center, two same colored cells vertically and horizontally adjacent to the center, and four more same colored cells diagonally adjacent. The diamond pattern has a size of 3x3 but with the corners being black.\\\\n17. To make the output, you have to detect the colored cell in the input grid. Wherever you find a colored cell, transform it into a diamond pattern of that color in the output grid. Diamond pattern consists of colored cells expanding out from the center and then contracting back to the center. The diamond pattern would cover a 5x5 grid area with the original colored cell in the center. The row and column containing the center cell would have only the center cell colored. The adjacent row and column would have three consecutive colored cells in the center with black cells on both sides. The outermost row and column would have five consecutive colored cells in the center. Note if more than one colored cells are found in the input grid, generate as many diamond patterns in the output with each diamond in different color.\\\\n18. To make the output, you have to note the colored cells in the input grid. Each colored cell represents a corner of a square. Draw a diamond shape from each located colored cell, The diamond shape extends two steps height and width wise from the located colored cell. Fill the path and the inside of the diamond shape with the same color as the colored cell, but leave the center of the diamond shape black. If there are two colored cells in the input, draw two overlapping diamond shapes with their respective colors.\\\\n19. To make the output, you have to form a diamond around the colored spots, without changing the center. The width of the diamond should be the same as the distance from the colored spot to the nearest edge of the grid by its strip of black cells. The diamond\\\\\\'s border cells should be marked with the color of the spot in the input grid, while the center remains the same color as the spot in the input. If there are two spots, then two diamonds need to be drawn.\\\\n20. Starting from the position of each colored cell in the input grid, expand the colored cell into a diamond shape, where the diamond is upright (its diagonals are vertical and horizontal), the diamond is 5 cells high and wide (the middle line contains 5 cells of the colored cell\\\\\\'s colour), and the colored cell from the input is at the center of the diamond. If there are multiple colored cells in the input, each should be expanded in the same way. If the diamonds overlap, the cell should take the color of the diamond drawn later (the one corresponding to the colored cell which is further down and to the right). All other cells should be left unchanged (black).\\\\n21. To transform the input grid into the output, place the following pattern: a \"diamond\" shape with the colored cell in the middle (2 cells in the center line and 3 cells above and below it forming a diamond), with the rest of the diamond filled with non-color cells. The pattern should be positioned in such a way that the colored cell from the input grid is at the center of the diamond. Repeat this pattern for each non-black cell in the input grid.\\\\n22. To make the output, you have to change the single colored cell and transform it into a square of same color. The original colored cell should be at the center of the new formed square. Each side of the new square should have odd number of cells including the original one, and equals to the nearest odd number greater than the total rows/2. Note that the square is hollow with only the border colored, and the inside should remain black.\\\\n23. To make the output, you have to draw an arrow shape pointing rightward starting from the colored square. Draw the edges of the arrow two squares away from the colored square in all directions except to the left, where you draw it one square away. Fill all the squares within the arrow shape with the color of the square, except for the point of the arrow, which should be left black.\\\\n24. To make the output, you have to locate the colored cells in the input grid. Assuming the row and column of the colored cell represent the center of a new grid, create a diamond pattern on this grid spanning outward to both sides. The width of the diamond should equal the index of the row and column of the central colored cell. Apply this rule for each colored cell different from black.\\\\n25. To make the output, you have to draw three lines perpendicular to each other starting from the non-black pixel. One horizontal line of length three in both directions, one vertical line upwards of length three and one downwards of length two. The shape is similar to a \"+\". If there are two non-black pixels in the input, then you need to create two such \"+\" shapes. Keep these \"+\" signs five boxes away from the black square. If there is only one colored box in the input, then create the \"+\" sign of this color. If there are two colored boxes in the input, then create the \"+\" sign of each color. The color pixel in the input becomes the central point of the \"+\" sign in the output.\\\\n26. To make the output, you must draw the outline of a box around the colored pixel in the input. This box should extend downward and rightward, appearing directly to the right of the center line if there is an even number of cells, or on the center if there is an odd number. Repeat this process for each colored pixel in the picture.\\\\n27. To make the output, you need to locate the colored squares in the input grid and transform them into a specific shape. If the color is red (2) or green (3), create a diamond shape with the colored square as the center. If the color is teal (8) or grey (5), create a cross shape with the colored square as the center. The length of the cross or diamond shape should be five squares including the center. The rest of the squares should remain black.\\\\n28. To make the output, you should replace the single colored pixel in the input with a diamond of the same color. The diamond is four rows and four columns large with the original pixel as the center. At the center row and column, the diamond is filled with the color. In the rows and columns next to the center, the color is located at the ends, with black in the middle.\\\\n29. In order to transform the input to the output grid, create a diamond shape surrounding each colored cell. The color of the diamond should match the color of the original colored cell in the input grid. The length of the sides of the diamond should be half of the height of the grid. The diamond should contain empty (black cells) in its center with one colored cell at each corner and between each corner at every 60 degrees.\\\\n30. To make the output, you have to draw a filled square around each colored dot in the input. Each square\\\\\\'s edge is formed with the dot\\\\\\'s color and is four cells long. The center of each square is the colored dot from the input, which becomes a hollow square in the output, turning the cells around the centerpiece into the same color as the dot. The center of the square remains black. Repeat this pattern for all colored dots in the input. For the two colored dots, draw two squares with the respective color.\\\\n31. To make the output, you have to create a square box around the individual colored box in the input. The color of the box is determined by the original colored box in the input and the box should be filled half with the color. The colored box in the middle of the square should remain empty.\\\\n32. If the pixel in the input grid is red (2), create a small cross made up of red pixels in the output grid. The center of the cross is the same position where the single pixel in the input grid is. The cross should be 5 pixels tall and 5 pixels wide. If the pixel in the input grid is teal (8), create another cross made up of teal pixels in the output grid. This cross should overlap the red cross with shared center and be larger in size, with 7 pixels tall and 7 pixels wide. If the pixel is gray (5), then create the gray cross first followed by the teal cross.\\\\n33. To make the output, you need to replicate a colored pixel in a 3x3 square area, but leaving the corners black. The center of this square is aligned with the original colored pixel in the input grid. This process transforms the colored pixel on the input grid to a colored diamond shape on the output grid, with the colour of the original pixel.\\\\n34. To make the output, you have to draw a checkered chess rook symbol using appropriate color, the center of which is the corresponding colored cell from the input. The rook symbol spans an area of 5x3 cells on the grid. Make sure to leave the  middle cell of the rook blank. Additionally, if there is more than one colored cell in the input, then each should form its own rook symbol on the output. Apply this process for each color that is not black in the input. Everything else should remain black.\\\\n35. To make the output, you have to create two larger squares centered around the locations of the colored pixels in the input grid. These squares will be filled with the color of the corresponding colored pixel in the input, and they will contain a hole in their center which is filled with black.\\\\n36. To find the output, locate the colored box (boxes) in the input and mirror it to create a diamond shape where the original dot is the center. Use the same color for the mirrored dot and the legs of the diamond. Fill the middle of the diamond with black.\\\\n37. To generate the output, take the colored square position and create a 3x3 square of this color in the same row. The square should be in the middle of the grid with a colored border and a black center. The colored square in the input is replaced by this larger square in the output. Each row containing a colored square becomes a row with a corresponding colored square in the output. For rows without colored squares in the input, they remain the same in the output.\\\\n38. To make the output, you have to replace the colored pixel with the corresponding colored square. The square should have a side of 5 cells and the pixels should be the center of the square. The square itself should be hollow and the sides should consist of colored pixels like plus \"+\" sign from the center.\\\\n39. To transform the grid, first locate the colored square in the input. The color of this square will determine the color of the diamond you will draw in the output. Imagine the space as coordinates with the colored square as the zero point (0,0). In the output, draw a diamond shape with the colored square as the center. The diamond will have a horizontal and vertical spread of 4 squares (including the center square). The top and bottom of the diamond should be colored square. The middle row of the diamond should have a space in the center. Example for square color 5:  0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0\\\\n40. To make the output, you have to create a cross shape (5x5 for red and 7x7 for teal) centered on the square of the colored pixel. The lines of the cross should be the same color as the initial pixel and this line should be 1 square thick for red and 2 squares thick for teal. The center of the cross (1 square for red and 2x2 squares for teal) should remain black.\\\\n41. To form the output, a copy of the colored pixel each left, right, up and down in the same row and column has to be made. Then the four colored pixels are connected by pixels of the same color to form an X shape around the central pixel.\\\\n42. To make the output, you have to create a diamond box around the colored dot. The diamond should be color-matched to the dot, with the colored dot at the center of the diamond and the corners of the diamond being 1 block away from the edge of the grid. The inner cells of the diamond should be black.\\\\n43. To make the output, you need to create a 5x5 square around each colored square in the input grid. The colors of the squares in the output grid are the same as the ones in the input. The border of the square should be the same color as the original square and the center of the square is black. The rest of the grid remains black.\\\\n44. To make the output, you have to replace any colored cells with a vertically symmetrical diamond of that color. The diamond should be 3 cells high, and 2 cells wide, with the location of the cell in the input being the central cell. The diamond appears as follows:  [2, 0] [2, 2, 2] [2, 0]  Where 2 represents whatever the colored cell was in the input grid, and 0 represents black.\\\\n45. To make the output, you have to make a diamond pattern centered at the colored square(s) in the input image. The diamond\\\\\\'s width and height is 5 squares. The diamond itself is composed of the original color found at the center of the diamond with the exception of the middle square of each side which remains black.\\\\n46. To make the output, you have to identify the colored cell and create a diamond shape extending in all four directions, where the center cell of a diamond shape is the color cell. The radius of a diamond shape is four cells.\\\\n47. To transform the input grid to output, we have to expand the colored cells of the input grid inward from the edges and form squares of those colors. The size of the squares depends on the size of the input grid. The larger the size of the input grid, the larger the size of the squares in the output grid. The squares should be centrally-located on the lines where the colored cells were on the input. The color squares will be hollow, containing a black (0) square inside, and are bordered by the color from the input. The rest of the cells in the grid remain black.\\\\n48. To make the output, you have to make two squares around each colored pixel in the input grid, one bordering the colored pixel, and the other surrounding the first square, creating a pattern resembling a cross. The color of the squares should match the color of the pixel from the input grid. An exception is the center of the squares (the original position of the colored pixel in the input grid), which should remain black, breaking the pattern of the cross, making it look like a plus (+) symbol.\\\\n49. To make the output, you have to .Draw a diamond around the single colored cell. The diamond\\\\\\'s horizontal and vertical diagonals should have length 5 cells. The diamond border should be colored with same color as the single colored cell in the input. The diamond should be hollow, meaning the inside should still be black.\\\\n50. To make the output, you have to create a square shape for each colored pixel. The square should be located around the colored pixel spot in the input. The square will be as large as the spot\\\\\\'s distance between the given position and the top or the left edge of the input, whichever is shorter. The pixel in the original position will be left black. The color of the squares depends on the colors of the pixels in the input.\\\\n51. To create the output, form a diamond around each colored point. The color of the diamond should match the color of the point. The diamond should be the smallest possible size while still being symmetric vertically and horizontally. If the point is on the edge of the grid, the diamond should still be symmetric, but it should be cropped by the edge.\\\\n52. To make the output, you have to find the color number in the input grid and draw two 3x3 boxes using the same color number in the corresponding position of the output grid. In these boxes, the color forms a square ring on the border, and the inside is kept black. Place the boxes on both sides of the original color number\\\\\\'s position, horizontally. Place the box with the smaller color number on the left and the box with the larger color number on the right. If there\\\\\\'s only one colored cell in the input, then just draw one box in the output.\\\\n53. To make the output, you need to identify the colored pixels from the input and draw a diamond shaped pattern around both of them. The diamond pattern is made up of four \"V\" shaped lines. Each line of the \"V\" is 3 cells long. The color of each diamond should be the same as the color of its respective pixel in the input. If the colored pixel was a 5 in the input, then all of the cells in the diamond will be a 5 in the output, so on and so forth for other colors. All other cells will remain black as in the input grid.\\\\n54. To make the output, you have to draw a diamond shape centered at the position of the grey and teal cells with a size of the diamond being 3. The left and right edges of the diamond are the color of the original cells and the top and bottom edges of the diamond are black. The cell within the diamond shape is black.\\\\n55. To make the output, you have to find the dots in the grid. For each color of the dot, create a diamond shape centered at the position of the dot. The diamond\\\\\\'s diagonal should have a length of five boxes and the width of the diamond at the widest part is equal to three boxes. Make the color of the diamond the same as the color of the dot. Any overlapped parts between diamonds are black.\\\\n56. The transformation involves finding the non-black cell and using it as a point around which a square \\\\\\'ring\\\\\\' is drawn. The ring is drawn around the non-black cell, the center of the shape, and the color of the cell determines the color of the ring. The size of the square ring is proportionate to the total size of the grid. For every identified colored cell on the input grid, a corresponding square ring of the same color is drawn on the output grid. The ring\\\\\\'s interior and the rest of the grid remains black.\\\\n57. To make the output, you have to form squares around the colored cells. The squares should be filled with the color of the single cell that was in their center in the input grid. The length of the sides of the squares should be half the length of the side of the input grid. There should be a void of color in the center of the squares, forming a smaller square without a color. In summary, each colored cell in the input leads to a colored square in the output, that has a void square in its center.\\\\n58. To make the output, you have to create a square 4 dots wide around the central column where the original dot was placed. The original single dot is used to determine the color of the square\\\\\\'s border and its centre remains black without color. The color is only applied to the top, bottom, left, and right row or column around it.\\\\n59. To make the output, you have to convert each colored pixel into a square of the same color with the colored pixel at its center. The square should be five pixels wide and five pixels high. The center pixel of the square should replace the single colored pixel from the input. The rest of the square should follow a pattern: it expands two pixels around the center pixel, and there is a 3x3 square with the original colored pixel that remains black, forming a cross shape.\\\\n60. To make the output, you have to identify the colored squares in the input. They will act as center points for half-cross designs of the same color in the output grid. With each color acting as a center point, a half-cross shape composed of five boxes horizontally and vertically is designed. The very centre of the cross, where horizontal and vertical lines intersect, should be black. The rest of the boxes in the design should be of the same color matching with the center point.\\\\n61. To make the output, each colored pixel is transformed into a diamond of the same color. The diamond expands outward from the original colored pixel for up to three pixels and the interior of this diamond (not including the edges) is black (i.e., the diamond is hollow). Note that the original colored pixel lies in the center of the diamond.\\\\n62. To make the output, you have to make a diamond shape centered around the colored pixel or pixels in the input.  The colored pixel in the input is going to be the center of each diamond. The diamond size is always five cells in height and five cells in width, with the colored pixel in the center.   Each diamond is filled with the corresponding color, appearing as the colored pixel in the input.  The diamond is filled in such a way that it remains hollow from inside which is encircled by the respective colored cells.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "Based on the similarities in the rules, they can be categorized into eight distinct categories as follows:\n\nCategory 1: Rules involving the creation of squares around colored symbols (Rules: 1, 22, 30, 35, 43, 56, 57, 58).\nCategory 2: Rules involving the creation of diamonds around colored symbols (Rules: 5, 6, 7, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 28, 29, 33, 36, 42, 45, 46, 49, 51, 53, 54, 55, 61, 62).\nCategory 3: Rules involving the creation of cross or plus shapes around colored symbols (Rules: 11, 12, 25, 32, 40, 41, 48, 59, 60).\nCategory 4: Rules involving the creation of rectangles or boxes around colored symbols (Rules: 2, 4, 8, 26, 31, 52).\nCategory 5: Rules involving the creation of patterns or shapes that are not squares, diamonds, crosses, or rectangles (Rules: 13, 23, 34, 38, 44).\nCategory 6: Rules involving the expansion of colored symbols into larger grids or patches (Rules: 3, 9, 37).\nCategory 7: Rules involving the transformation of colored symbols into different shapes based on their color (Rules: 27, 32).\nCategory 8: Rules involving the creation of specific shapes around colored symbols based on their position in the grid (Rules: 39, 47, 50).\n\nSynthesized Rules:\n\nCategory 1: To make the output, identify the colored symbols in the input and create a square around each symbol.

For each category, synthesize the rules into a single, specific rule that combines the ideas of all rules in that category, while clearly differentiating it from the other categories.\\\\nThe new rule should be as specific as possible, following the format of the given rules.\\\\nThe new rule should be applicable without any information from the original rules - i.e. it should be standalone.\\\\n\\\\nRules:\\\\n1. To generate the output grid, replace every third instance of the symmetrically laid out pattern from the center with a vertical sequence of fuschia, green, and orange cells. Start with fuschia at the top, green in the middle and orange at the bottom. Then cycle these colours in clockwise order in subsequent vertical symmetry patterns.\\\\n2. To make the output, you have to fill in the solid blue shapes in a diagonal, checkered pattern with yellow and red pixels. Leave a trail of red leading into the shape, with yellow filling in the rest. If there is another blue shape directly adjacent to the first without a black pixel separating them, continue the checkered pattern into the next shape, beginning where the last shape left off.\\\\n3. To generate the output, take the 8\\\\\\'s in the input that have a non-black (non-zero) cell below them and change their value to that of the cell below them. For the cells that have no cell below them or have a black (0) cell below them, they remain the same.\\\\n4. The transformation uses the locations of the fuchsia and orange cells as reference points. Around these reference points, a repeating pattern of fuchsia, orange, and teal cells is copied into the output grid, replacing the original teal and black pattern. The pattern repeats to the right and then downwards until it hits a teal cell. If there is not enough space for the full pattern to fit, it bleeds into the next row. If it strays outside the boundaries of the teal rectangle, it stops. If the pattern reaches a new reference point while still being copied from an old one, a new pattern begins from this new reference point. If there are overlapping patterns, the one that started most recently takes precedence.\\\\n5. To make the output, observe the last three colors before the second to the last teal color on each row. If the colors are (Green, Red, Green), replace the black cells with the sequence (Green, Red, Green) until there are no more black cells or until the end of the grid. Repeat the same thing for the sequence (Red, Green, Red) but still do not replace the blacks on the teal patterns.\\\\n6. 1. If the spot colored differently (not black or teal) is surrounded by teal in a cross pattern, keep the spot and its surrounding cross pattern in the output.  2. If the differently colored spot is not surrounded by teal, replace it and the cross pattern around it with teal in the output. For example, if a grey (1) spot is not surrounded by teal, replace it and the cross pattern around it with teal.  3. Repeat the previous steps until all differently colored spots are processed.  4. All other black and teal spots remain the same in the output.\\\\n7. To make the output, you should rotate the teal rows 90 degree to clockwise, moving the yellow color(4) next to the first black grid space after teal in each row and, if there are, yellow color(4) and red color (1) will follow it replacing the teal grids in order. You must keep the corners and edges where there are no black spaces as they were in the input teal.\\\\n8. The transformation rule has 3 key steps. Firstly, Scan the input top to bottom line by line, from left to right. Secondly, anytime you come across the first purple cell, mark that cell and the cell directly below it as orange. If you come across additional purple cells adjacent in the same line, mark them and the cell directly right of the first marked orange cell as gray. Repeat this until you no longer come across any purple cells. Finally, any blue cell that is not modified remains the same in the output.\\\\n9. To make the output, you have to reflect the teal squares and colored dots over the diagonal line of teal squares. The color of the dot changes depending on its distance from the diagonal. If the dot is one square away from the line, it becomes yellow; two squares away, it becomes green; three squares away, it becomes red; four squares away, it becomes blue.\\\\n10. The pattern of transformation seems to be making each teal pixel rotate in a counterclockwise fashion around its current quadrant within its 4x4 grid patch. Swap the positions of the top and right pixel, right and bottom, bottom and left and left to top. For non-black or non-teal pixels, repeat a pattern of [teal (8), grey (1), yellow (4)], starting from the first non-black or non-teal pixel, and heading to the right then downwards to the next row. Any black (0) cells remain the same.\\\\n11. To make the output, you have to locate every column with fuschia or yellow cells. If the column has fuschia cells, you should change every colorless cell below it to fuschia. In columns with yellow cells, change every colorless cell below it to yellow. All other cells should remain unchanged.\\\\n12. To make the output, any consecutive teal square from left to right is replaced by a 4-cycle repeating pattern of colors teal, green, red, and green. If it encounters a non-teal cell, then it will reset the repeating pattern.\\\\n13. The rule of transformation is to replace each \"line\" of colored squares (green and red) by a pattern of orange (3), brown (2), and orange (3). The pattern may start either on the green square or on the red square, but the order of the color sequence always remains the same. If the line is ended prematurely with a blue square, then we stop the pattern and continue with this pattern when the new colored line starts again.\\\\n14. To make the output, you have to follow a similar pattern to a flood-fill algorithm. Starting with the pink square, replace all connected teal squares with grey squares. Then, repeat the process starting with the orange square, this time replacing all connected grey squares with teal squares. Finally, repeat the process one last time starting with the grey square, this time replacing all connected teal squares with grey squares.\\\\n15. To make the output, you have to copy the input grid to the output grid. However, if there is a green cell, then replace the green cell with a yellow or red cell\u2014reuse the sequence of yellow-red cells in order. Starting at the top left corner of the grid and moving from left to right row by row until you reach the bottom right corner, place a sequence of yellow/red colors in the first position where green occurs, repeat this sequence for every subsequent green cell.\\\\n16. The pattern appears to be related to the single horizontal line of color across the middle of each grid. When a colored block (being other than teal) shows up in the grid at a line of only teal blocks, this same colored block then appears in the corresponding columns in the grids above and below it, replacing the original teal blocks. All other block colors and positions remain unchanged.\\\\n17. 1. First, you need to identify the sequences of teal blocks in the vertical direction with the pattern 8-1-8 and replace these sequences with the pattern 8-4-1 whenever these sequences occur in the grid.   2. Subsequently, you need to follow a specific rule for filling in the blocks where the teal (8) blocks were initially located. If there was a grey (3) block to the left of that position in the original grid, then the new grid should have an orange (2) block in that position. If there was a grey (3) block to the right of that position in the original grid, then the new grid should have a grey (3) block in that position. And if there was no grey (3) block adjacent in either direction, then the new grid should have a teal (8) block in that position.   3. Repeat these two steps until the entire grid has been transformed.\\\\n18. The transformation involves adding a consistent sequence of grey and orange cells on each row with initially empty (black) cells. The sequence follows a \\\\\\'zig-zag\\\\\\' pattern starting from the right- going \\\\\\'grey-orange-grey\\\\\\'. It is stopped when hits a teal cell. Continue the pattern when hits a black cell again. This pattern should advance for each row from bottom to top. On each side of the orange cell, there should be a grey cell or teal/black cell if there is no more space. If a row is full, no additional grey or orange cells are added.\\\\n19. To make the output, you have to first copy the input grid. Then go through each square of the grid. If it\\\\\\'s a black square and it\\\\\\'s surrounded by teal squares in the four cardinal directions, replace it by a cross made up of green and red squares. The order of the green and red squares in the cross alternates: the square to the left of the center of the cross should be green, then going clockwise, make the next red, then green, then red. If it\\\\\\'s not a black square surrounded by teal squares in the four cardinal directions, keep it as it is.\\\\n20. The Output transformation involves replacing 0s in the input grid with an oscillating pattern of number 1 (blue), number 4 (yellow), number 1 (blue), and so on. This pattern repeats in every row such that any original 0s are replaced by this pattern from left to right. The pattern reset in every row and every column, so the left-most and top-most 0s are always replaced by 1 (blue). The pattern seems to ignore other numbers and just replaces 0s. Other patterns are unchanged.\\\\n21. The transformation rule goes like this - Locate three consecutive vertically-aligned teal cells with the middle cell surrounded by two teal cells, and replace them (from top to bottom) by teal, green, and teal. Also, locate four consecutive grey cells in every row and replace them (from left to right) with alternating green and gray cells. Ignore and leave other sequences unchanged.\\\\n22. To make the output, you have to go along every row and fill all the white spaces after the blues one with the pattern blue, yellow and red, if they are present. If they are not, you fill the spaces with white. This pattern is being added following a rule where if prior to a white space exists a blue we place a yellow, if a yellow a red and if a red a blue, meaning cycle the pattern till a black site appears and then restart the pattern but still considering the continuation of the pattern. If no colours exist in the row you leave the whites as they are.\\\\n23. To make the output grid, first, count the total number of single isolated vertical bars in the input grid. If the bar is teal, replace it with yellow in the output, and when it\\\\\\'s orange, replace with green. Then, for each group of horizontal bars in the input, count the number of cells in the group. If the group has an odd number of cells, replace it with yellow cells in the output and if it has an even number of cells, replace it with green cells. Isolated individual cells that do not belong to any group, remain as they are.\\\\n24. To make the output, transform every active pixel to blue (1) if it is located at the top of the grid, red (2) if it is located at the middle of the grid and green (3) if it is located at the bottom of the grid. The location should be determined by breaking the grid into three equal parts horizontally. In case the number of rows is not divisible by 3, the middle section should contain more rows. If the pixel is located on the border between two sections, it should be colored with the color of the lower section it is located in. If the pixel is inactive, leave it as it is.\\\\n25. 1. Identify the yellow (1) and orange (4) squares inside the teal area. 2. Scan each line of the grid from top to bottom and left to right. 3. Keeping the teal area intact, fill every third (1st and 4th) teal diagonal line with yellow if it contains a yellow square, and orange if it contains an orange square. The sequence should reset after the fourth diagonal line. 4. All the squares outside the teal area remain the same.\\\\n26. To make the output, you have to go through the three rows just above the teal line, from below: The lowest row remains unchanged. In the second row (counting from below), replace every pair of adjacent teal blocks with a teal and a brown block. Replace the remaining teal blocks on that row with brown blocks. In the third row from below, replace every pair of adjacent teal blocks with a teal and green block, also replace every remaining teal block with a green block. Finally, Replace the cells holding the yellow with green and brown blocks alternatively starting with brown from left.\\\\n27. To make the output, replace the segmenting squares (grey, orange, pink) with their corresponding colours in pattern sequence: if viewed row-wise gray is replaced by sequence of [teal, grey, pink], whereas orange and pink is replaced by sequence [grey, pink]. If any of the colors appear as a single square (not segmenting) it should be left as it is.\\\\n28. To make the output, you follow a two-step process. First, you identify the array of orange, green, red, and yellow cells which form a distinct pattern. You then translate or move this distinct pattern into the place of the black cell that is just at the right of every teal-black boundary. If the distinct pattern gets to the corner or edge of the grid, it wraps around to the beginning like a snake. In this way, the distinctly colored pattern of cells is distributed throughout the grid in an orderly fashion from left to right.\\\\n29. To achieve the transformation to the output grid, you need to reflect the figure made up by the grey and fuchsia squares (numbers 3 and 2 in the first grid and numbers 1 and 4 in the second grid) vertically, in a line perpendicular to the defined boundary in the figure composed of teal squares (number 8). This reflection appears in the teal figure maintaining the same boundary definition.   In other words, the pattern is flipping the small shapes of numbers (3 and 2 on the first grid and numbers 1 and 4 on the second grid) within the figure with teal (8) around the middle teal horizontal line, like a mirror reflection.\\\\n30. To make the output, you have to examine each row of the grid individually. For each row, follow this pattern - start from left and look for consecutive teal cells that are two or more in size. Replace the second and following cells of such blocks with a sequence of 1 (grey), 4 (yellow), and 3 (green), repeating until the block ends. The first cell of each teal block should remain unchanged. Every other cells, that are not part of a teal block of two or more, should remain unchanged.\\\\n31. To make the output, you have to examine each 3x3 square within the grid. If there are green cells within that square, you replace all the teal cells within that same square with green in the output. If there is a red cell, you replace all the teal cells within that same square with red. Do this for every overlapping 3x3 square within the grid. If there is both a green and a red cell within the 3x3 square, replace the teal cells with the color that appears most recently in columns from left to right.\\\\n32. To make the output grid from the input , you have to replace the teal cells (number 8) by orange, green and orange cells (numbers 1, 2 and 1 respectively) in the order for every four teal cells from the edge inclusive. If a teal cell is already replaced by a grey or green cell leave it as it is. For the rest of the teal cells (number 8), if there are less than four before black cell appears, replace with orange and green in order till black cell appears and then repeat from orange. If they are grouped in fours then replace them with order 1, 4, 1 and 4. If a teal cell is already replaced by a grey or green cell leave it as it is and continue with the next replacement color. Place the other cells as they were in the input grid.\\\\n33. To generate the output, note that the murals are divided into segments by columns of entirely black spaces (number 0). Within each mural segment, there may exist certain inner symbols or shapes, indicated by non-teal and non-black cells. These symbols or shapes are repeated across the mural, moving in the direction from left to right. For instance, orange, fuschia, and grey artifacts (number 1, 3, and 2 respectively) observed in the input can be seen re-appearing in the next mural segment. The pattern repeats itself from the first segment thereafter, but with these new colors spaced evenly among existing teal cells. If a non-teal, non-black color is encountered in a mural, the same color repeats itself at an equal distance in the next segment, effectively creating a visual pattern of repeating colors.\\\\n34. To make the output, first, scan each four consecutive cells horizontally if they consist of two teal cells on either end with two black cells sandwiched between them, replace the black cells with yellow and green cells alternately starting with yellow at the leftmost. If the four consecutive cells consist of two black cells at either end with two teal cells sandwiched between them, replace the teal cells with yellow and green cells alternately starting with yellow at the leftmost. Other cells stay the same.\\\\n35. To make the output, each place that has teal color, keep it teal. For every top row that has a teal color, change the second row on the right to a yellow color and continue this pattern for every second row on the right. When you see the second color in the input either fuchsia or red, replace the color with yellow in the output only once for each color found. The rest of the output should remain unchanged from the input.\\\\n36. To transform the input grid into the output, follow these steps: 1. Identify where the yellow and green squares are in the input. Each yellow square is replaced with a sequence of alternating \\\\\\'1\\\\\\' (green) and \\\\\\'4\\\\\\' (yellow) depending on the number of teal squares below it before a black square or the grid limit is hit. The same is done for the green squares but returning a \\\\\\'4\\\\\\' (yellow) first. 2. In the output grid, replace all the yellow and green squares in the same location as the input grid with this alternating pattern. 3. All the remaining squares should keep their original values.\\\\n37. To make the output, you have to apply the following changes: 1. If a teal cell is surrounded by at least six other teal cells, it is replaced by a grey cell in the output. 2. Additionally, if a teal cell is horizontally adjacent to a yellow cell, the two cells interchange their positions. This rule takes precedence over rule 1.  3. Finally, if a teal cell is vertically adjacent to a grey cell, the two cells interchange their positions. This rule takes precedence over rule 1 and rule 2. All other cells remain the same in the output.\\\\n38. To make the output, you have to Add a vertical reflection of the colors within the black cells in the teal zones. Keep the black cells, teal cells and the colors that are not within the black shape as they are. The reflection starts from the center of the grid to the right edge of the grid. It contains the colors within the black shape and maintains their order.\\\\n39. To make the output, you should apply the following rule:  Focus on mainly the teal (8), green (3), yellow (2), and red (1) squares. - Replace all first teal squares encountered from left to right in every row with red (1).  - In every subsequent sequence of teal squares encountered in that same row, replace the first square with yellow (2), then the next with green (3), then red (1) and continue this sequence (2, 3, 1) until the end of the row.  - Repeat this for every row in the grid. Keep all other squares the same.\\\\n40. To make the output, you have to replace some of the teal boxes with the pattern of yellow and fuchsia boxes from the bottom of the input grid. The pattern will be repeated in the same row in the output grid where the teal boxes is present in the input grid. The pattern is started from the leftmost teal box in the row and moves to the right. Repeat the pattern until it is no longer possibile because of existing black boxes or the end of the row.\\\\n41. To make the output, you have to identify the sequence of green, fuschia and sky blue on the previous row. If there is such sequence on the previous row, then on the current row replace the color with this sequence. If there is such sequence on the previous column, then on the current column change the color according to the sequence. Then fill the gap that is not connected to the color block with fuschia.\\\\n42. To make the output, you have to look for the presence of an orange number (marked as \\\\\\'3\\\\\\' or \\\\\\'4\\\\\\') at any location in the grid. If an orange number is found, the corresponding location in the output grid should be marked with the same orange number; otherwise, it should be marked with the original number from the input grid. Also, copy the orange number to four positions to the right of its location, overwriting whatever number is there, unless there is already an orange number there.\\\\n43. To make the output, you have to detect the orange shapes against teal background. These orange squares should move clockwise along the frame formed by the teal lines, taking all the room between the lines. The red square also moves, but in the opposite direction (counterclockwise). The square rotation is performed between the input and output.\\\\n44. To obtain the output, follow these steps:  There is a sequence of numbers appearing to the right of each shape (either 1-blue, 4-yellow), repeat this sequence in every empty cell (0-black) within the shape, replacing the black cells with the sequence.  If a shape does not have the sequence to begin with, the shape remains as per the input, without any changes.   If a shape has multiple sequences, the latest sequence should be used.\\\\n45. Here is how you can transform the grid:  - First, detect a sequence of teal numbers that depresses down and then rises up again, looking like a valley. This sequence is not interrupted by any other colors.  - If there is a grey number on the left of the valley, and an orange number on the right of the valley, fill up that valley in the output grid by alternating between yellow and blue numbers, starting with yellow on the left and ending with blue on right.  - All other colors from the input grid remain the same in the output grid.\\\\n46. To make the output, you have to fill the black areas with alternating indigo digit 1 and raspberry digit 4, sequentially from the left. Do this for every row from top to bottom, the sequence of fill begins with 1 in every new row regardless of the last filled number in the previous row. The pattern of teal digit 8 from the input remains unchanged in the output.\\\\n47. To make the output, you have to identify the red and green spots in the input patterns. Draw a line from the first (top left) red spot to the last one (bottom right). Do the same for the green spots. On the black tiles that connect the red spots, place the yellow color (4), and on the black tiles that connect the green spots, place the blue color (1). All other cells remain the same.\\\\n48. To create the output, you perform the following steps:  1. Look in the 9 x 9 box in the top left corner. Are there yellow/green squares in the box? If not, move to step 2.      If there are yellow/green squares in the 9 x 9 box, replace every teal square in the rows where the yellow/green squares are located with grey. Then, every other teal square in these rows to the right of the nine square box should be replaced with yellow in an alternating fashion (starting with the first teal square).  2. Look in the 9 x 9 box in the top right corner. Are there yellow/green squares in the box? If not, nothing else needs to be done.     If there are yellow/green squares in the 9 x 9 box, replace every teal square in the rows where the yellow/green squares are located with grey. Then, every other teal square in these rows to the left of the nine square box should be replaced with yellow in an alternating fashion (starting with the first teal square).\\\\n49. To make the output, you have consider the squares filled with green (3), red (2) and fuschia (3). The green colored squares are to be replaced by a red to fuschia gradient on every alternate column starting from the first column. Replace every third column with green, and all remaining columns should contain the original teal from the input pattern.  Mapping: 0:black; 1:blue; 2:red; 3:green; 4:yellow; 5:grey; 6:fuschia; 7:orange; 8:teal; 9:brown.\\\\n50. The transformation pattern consists in looking at the input grid where each colored field, in the position that matches the center field of the 3x3 neighborhood of the green fields, changes its color according to the color of that central position. If there isn\\\\\\'t any color in that central position, the field remains green. As a result, you should see the same shapes and patterns now including these other colors according to the pattern rules.\\\\n51. To transform the input into the output, the grey and orange blocks from the input, if present, needs to be spread across the whole input. Copy the pattern of orange and grey from the row where they are located, and overlay it onto the entire grid. Under this overlay, teal remains teal, black remains black, but wherever there is an orange block, it turns the underlying block to grey, and wherever there is a grey block, it turns the underlying block to orange.\\\\n52. The input grid is transformed into the output grid by replacing the orange blocks with a sequence of green and grey blocks mimicking a Morse code-like pattern: 3, 2, 3, 2 and so on starting from the very far left orange block and going to the right and downwards following the teal path until the last orange block has been replaced. All other blocks remain the same.\\\\n53. To identify the transformation, first take note of the locations of the orange and purple squares in the input grid. In the output grid, these are shown in alternating orange and purple color that are in multiples of 4 starting from upper left portion and direction from left to right and up to down. All unaltered teal squares in the input grid remain the same in the output grid. All the black squares from the input grid remain unchanged in the output.\\\\n54. To make the output, duplicate the diagonal patterns of yellows (4), reds (2) and greens (3) to the lower half of the grid, replacing the black (0). This is done by reflecting the pattern diagonally across the main diagonal. However, when duplicating, make sure each sequence of colors starts with green (3), followed by yellow (4) and red (2), in this sequence.\\\\n55. To make the output, we must follow some steps. Each 2x2 cell in the input should become a 2x2 cell in the output. If the input cell contains any fuschia, the output cell should be filled with half teal and half yellow in a checkered pattern. If the input cell contains any orange, the output cell should be filled with half teal and half green in a checkered pattern. If it contains no fuschia or orange, the output cell should be simply copied from the input.\\\\n56. To create the output from the input, follow the blue color trail, the first blue cell that has a yellow or red neighbor becomes yellow (3) and red (2) in turn. Continue along the path of the blue cells, alternating between yellow and red, until you reach another yellow or red cell. When you encounter a yellow or red cell, proceed with that color in the alternating sequence. The sequence then continues alternately (yellow-red-yellow) until another yellow or red cell is found where the cycle begins anew. This process continues until all possible paths are completed. If a blue cell has no yellow or red neighbor, then it does not change color and remain as blue.\\\\n57. To make the output, you have to look for a special sequence of boxes in each line of the input grid (black, teal, black) and replace this sequence with a new sequence (yellow, red, yellow) respectively. This sequence can be in the middle, at the start, or at the end of each line.\\\\n58. To make the output, you have to transform the input grid by following the instructions:  >To track the tattoo-like design, first locate areas on the grid that are marked with a yellow dot. In these areas, there\\\\\\'s a 3x2 block that alternates between a yellow and red pattern. This pattern begins on the top left with a yellow dot and continues to the right with a red dot beneath the yellow one. The pattern reverts to yellow to the right of the red dot, beneath the topmost yellow one. The pattern repeats, switching back to red beneath the yellow dot.  >After identifying these patterns, replace any teal pixels on the grid that appear below this 3x2 yellow and red pattern with an alternating series of yellow and red strips. The color of the stripes should be arranged the same way as they are in the 3x2 block above. Alternate each 1x4 vertical segment from yellow to red starting with yellow and moving to the right. It\\\\\\'s critical to remember that the blocks within the segment should be separated by a line of teal.  >And if a yellow spot appears in a location without\\\\n59. To get the output grid from the input grid, you should identify the pattern of the three-cell groups in each line of the input grid. These groups consist of three cells in the sequence: black, teal and black again.  In the output grid, this three-cell sequence is replaced by a sequence of green, orange and green cells. Apart from this, the teal and black cells in the input grid are kept unchanged in the output grid.\\\\n60. To make the output transform all cells surrounded by teal cells in each quadrant into a gradient of grey (1) to yellow (4), with the middle value being teal. The gradient pattern should start from the fifth cell from a border, proceed with teal, and end with yellow on the border. For cells on the border and not surrounded by teal, remain the same as in the input grid.\\\\n61. To transform the input into the output grid, you have to replace every consecutive pair of cyan cells with one green (3) followed by one blue (2) cell. These replacements should start from the top left of the grid and happen in a left to right, top to bottom manner. If there is a single cyan cell, it should be replaced with a green cell. If there is a blue cell in the input grid, it should be replaced by corresponding cells in the sequential pattern of green, blue in the output grid. If black cells are encountered, they keep their position and color, hence do not interrupt the cyan cell replacement pattern but hold the place until colors come again.\\\\n62. Starting from the top, go through the grid row by row. When you find the first row of colored boxes that is not entirely teal, note the pattern of colors. Then return to the top of the grid and begin replacing every isolated teal box (the one surrounded by black boxes) with this pattern of colors, in circular manner. Continue the pattern until you reach the end of the grid. The color pattern is repeated, each color for each occurrence of a standalone teal square found, in a cyclical, left to right order, repeating across rows from top to bottom.\\\\n63. To make the output, you make a sequence on every grey and red colored path which is following the pattern [Grey, Red, Grey, Red,...] (this pattern starts with the first appearance of one of these colors in every row). Green boxes stay in the same place. Black and teal boxes also stay in the same places where they were at the beginning.\\\\n64. The transformation seems to be related to the presence of the isolated teal squares in the lower part of the matrix. In the output, these isolated teal squares are replicated four times along each row with the exception on the rows with double teal squares where a pattern of dark gray and red shapes seems to overlay the original pattern. On the rest of the grid, any teal square is replaced by a red square. The size and the position of the original shapes seems to be conserved in the output. The pattern transformation doesn\\\\\\'t seem to have any rotation, resizing or symmetry operation involved.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "Category 1: Color Replacement Based on Position\nRule: Replace specific colors in the input grid based on their position or surrounding colors.

To make the output, fill the top half of the grid mirroring the color pattern of the bottom half, but using the secondary color instead of the primary color. The black squares from the bottom half should be copied as black squares in the top half. The process can be seen as mirroring the bottom half of the grid to the top with color transformation from primary to secondary.\\\\n2. The transformation involves the largest black square. Nothing changes except within the region that makes up the largest black square. We take the second most inner square (one step away from the central smallest square) and replace its color with that of the innermost square. The replaced cells should resemble a \\\\\\'+\\\\\\' sign, with an equal number of cells on all sides of the center.\\\\n3. To get the output grid, the color from the center of the shape is mirrored or copied across the top part of the shape. Specifically, the color cells just above the center are replicated to their symmetric positions at the top.\\\\n4. To make the output, you have to consider the middle row of the grid and mark some spots on the superior half with the third lowest non-black color from the grid. If we divide the grid in half horizontally, and we take the confrontational points of the upper half relative to the middle row, we colour them with the third lowest non-black color from the grid (black is considered color).\\\\n5. To make the output, you have to create a spotlight effect on the plus-shaped pattern. The cells in the middle of the plus (colored cells that are surrounded by other same colored cells) will shine a yellow spotlight on the same positions above it. Specifically, on the positions corresponding to the top left to bottom right diagonal, the spotlight will shine twice and be a brighter, deeper shade of yellow.\\\\n6. To get from the input to the output, imagine a line of reflection on middle row (horizontally) . For each row above the line of reflection, reflect its contents to the corresponding row below the line of reflection, but keep the color of boxes on the line of reflection and below it the same.\\\\n7. In the output, the square shape is extended vertically and horizontally maintaining its symmetry. The color for the extended shape is taken from the color of the innermost square of the shape in the input. Only extensions are mirrored top to bottom and left to right, they do not fill the total grid, they only occupy black spaces that exist between the original shape and the exact middle row and column of the input grid, provided that those rows/columns in the exact middle are black in the input grid. If the rows or columns at the exact middle of the grid are not black, no extensions are provided in that direction.\\\\n8. To form the output grid, if there is a completely black row (0s) in the input grid, reflect the shape identified in the second part diagonally across the entire grid. Maintain the same color that is in the input grid.\\\\n9. To form the output, locate the largest ring and use the color to fill the center of the black area in the rings above it. The filled area will create a cross shape reaching to all four sides of the ring. This transformation should be made in all rings above the largest ring. The largest ring and everything below it remain the same as in the input grid.\\\\n10. To gain the output, mirror the color of the innermost cells at the center of the grid above to the corresponding cells at the center of the black space at the top. The mirrored region has the same dimensions as the smallest colored square at the center of the grid. The mirror operation is symmetric with respect to the central row of the grid.\\\\n11. The transform involves mirroring the lowest row of the central figure with colored cells to the equivalent cells in the uppermost row of the same figure, with the numbers from the lower row copied directly onto the equivalent spaces on the top row. For example, in the case of a 3x3 grid, the number in the bottom cell at position (3,2) will be copied to the top cell at position (1,2). The same applies for larger figures with additional rows.   Note: The center of these figures always remains the same and only the top sections are changed.\\\\n12. This transformation consists of coloring the diagonals of the bigger colored square with the color of the smaller square inside. The color should not overlap the outer edge of the colored area. The rest of the grid remains unchanged.\\\\n13. To convert the input to output, fill the grid starting from the central row upwards with the same color as the bottom middle cell in a symmetrical pattern, leaving the rest of the cells black. This symmetry is similar to that seen in the bottom half of the grid. Fill in each row one by one, symmetrically on both sides leaving the centered cells black and continue towards the top. The transformation ceases when the color changes in the bottom half.\\\\n14. To make the output, you have to take the color of the chevron from the lowest row of the input and place it symmetrically in the upper half of the grid to make a diamond shape. The rest of the cells keep their color from the input.\\\\n15. To make the output, you have to take the number from the second row from the bottom of the inner square and replace that in the respective upside-down positions of the upper square where there are original black boxes. Essentially, you are creating a reflection of the second row from the bottom of the inner square to the upper part of grid.\\\\n16. To make the output, you need to take the lowest non-zero number in the input grid and use it to replace some of the 0\\\\\\'s, starting from the center and proceeding symmetrically outward. You should only do this for the top half or less, maintaining the symmetry. The pattern spatially interpolated the value.\\\\n17. To make the output, replace all black cells in upper part of the input grid with reverse mirror image of the colored pattern from below. The middle part of the upper image will always be identical to the colored cell which is at the middle of the lower image. The colored cells around it follow the left-right symmetry of bottom colored pattern.\\\\n18. To make the output, you have to apply a reflection transformation. Reflect the lower part into the upper part across the middle line horizontally such that the non-black color in the lowest row becomes the non-black color in the highest row and so forth, whereas the black boxes remain black. The lower half remains unchanged.\\\\n19. To make the output, you have to make a diagonal line of red cells passing through the center of the grid, that matches up with the corners of the innermost colored square seen in the input. The rest of the grid should mimic the input grid.\\\\n20. The transformation can be achieved by taking the color of the center element from the bottom row and then mirroring it along the central horizontal axis but without replacing any existing colored element. The rest of the cells remain empty as before.\\\\n21. To make the output, you have to replace the center of the cross (excluding its middle point) in the input grid with the color found at the middle point (the center) of the cross in the last row of the input grid.\\\\n22. To make the output, the cells in the center row of the grid are examined. If a colored cell (not black) is found, the color is duplicated diagonally in the empty cells above it, creating mirrored X-shapes. The larger the grid, the bigger the diagonal colored pattern above the T-shaped structure.\\\\n23. The pattern involves symmetry around the horizontal axis. The color which fills the middle part in the lower section, takes up the position of black squares in the upper section in a symmetric pattern. The outermost black square adjacent to the lower colored part is replaced by the filling color of the lower section. The black squares placed symmetrically along the horizontal axis are filled with the same color. The rest of the squares remains the same as input.\\\\n24. To make the output, you have to mirror the \"V\" (turn it upside down) in the colour that is not part of the \"V\". You then replace the black boxes in the original \"V\" with the mirrored colour. Keep the original \"V\" unchanged.\\\\n25. To make the output, take the biggest number besides 0 at the bottom of the pattern. Then mirror this pattern along the axis running from the top left to the bottom right of the grid by placing the number you picked. Make sure you only replace the 0\\\\\\'s in the reflected pattern and leave the rest of the grid as is.\\\\n26. You can obtain the output grid from the input grid by reflecting the colors present in the last row before the black rows (from the bottom), on the black cells above it symmetrically, swapping the the colors from the sides. Only the second color (side color)from the row with two colors in the input grid is reflected.\\\\n27. To make the output, you have to reflect the colored structure in the input above itself symmetrically to the center row. Replace blacks with the reflected color in the output. The original structure stays same in its position.\\\\n28. To create the output grid, take the smallest colored structure in the centre of the grid. Then mirror this structure along the centre of the grid (both vertically and horizontally), replacing its original color with the color found at the centre of the structure before the transformation.\\\\n29. To make the output, you have to take the color of the central point of the shape at the bottom, and place it symmetrically in the upper black area of the grid, forming an inverse symmetric shape with the new color.\\\\n30. To make the output, you have to fill in the empty cells of the input grid with the color of the centrally located cells in the last row, such that the pattern is symmetrical vertically and horizontally with respect to the center of the grid.\\\\n31. In order to transform the input into output, we need to create mirror image of the lower half of the grid (not including the middle row) into the upper half of the grid to achieve symmetry. This is done by copying the color from the lower half into the respective position in the upper half.   For example, in Case 0, the number 4 from the lower half of the grid is mirrored to the equivalent position in the upper half of the grid. Similarly in case 1, the number 3 from the lower half is mirrored to the upper half. The end result is a grid that is completely symmetrical about its horizontal middle line.\\\\n32. To transform the grid, flip the top half of the diamond shape vertically to replace the black cells at the top part of the grid. If the cell in the grid lines are symmetrical (with respect to center of grid) off the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right), then swap them. Keep the cells on the main diagonal as is and mirror off diagonal elements by swapping about the main diagonal. The bottom half of the grid remains the same.\\\\n33. To make the output, you have to mirror the shape made by the numbers on the bottom of the input grid in the top half of the output grid. The mirrored numbers should replace the 0s in the top half of the grid only up to the length of the shape in the bottom half. Any remaining 0s in the top half of the grid should remain 0s. The bottom half of the grid should remain the same as the input.\\\\n34. To make the output, look at the colored square in the bottom row that is in the middle. Then color the cells in the top rows of the output grid to mirror the position of this middle square. If the original colored square is red, color the mirrored cells yellow; if it is teal, color them green; if it is fuschia, color them blue. Leave all other cells the same as in the input grid.\\\\n35. To create the output grid, you need to duplicate the color of the middle cell on the last row of the upper half of the grid in a pattern that resembles an upper triangle. This is done by taking the first cell on the last row of the upper half of the grid and painting it with the same color of the middle cell on the last row and doing the same for the last cell on that row and creating a mirror-like pattern towards the middle of that row. Leave all other cells as in the input.\\\\n36. To create the output, mirror the color configuration of the lower half (excluding black squares) in the upper half. Turn the color configuration upside-down and assign the individual color numbers of the bottom to black squares in the top, while keeping the original bottom half.\\\\n37. To obtain the output grid, reflect the blue squares along the vertical axis, and fill out the squares on the top half of the grid accordingly, above the red pyramid, keeping the rest of the squares black. The blue squares should be placed above and along the centerline of the red pyramid in a symmetric manner.\\\\n38. To get from the input grid to the output grid, you must mirror the bottom colored number above the second colored number, with black cells in between them. The upper row of color is equal to the bottommost row of the former color in the input grid.\\\\n39. The pattern transformation seems to find the third number (number different from the outermost and innermost ones) in the last line then places that number on the points to form a cross in the first few squares before the innermost square. The rest of the boxes remain the same. Black boxes are not changed, only boxes with a color (represented by a number 1-9) are affected.\\\\n40. To make the output, you have to reflect the bottom half of the grid onto the top half. Colors in the top half should match the corresponding positions in the bottom half. Black remains as black when mirrored.\\\\n41. Transform the input to output by painting the positions that are symmetrical to the tip of the inverted T-shape along the center line with the color of the tip. Keep other positions unchanged.\\\\n42. The transformation applied here is mirroring the color of the second to last row (the row that is immediately above the row of the colored cells in the bottom of the grid) on the top of the grid. The mirroring should be done such that it is symmetric about the central row (if there are more than one row, take the middle one), the colored cells appear in the same positions symmetric about the center of the grid. This can also be thought as duplicating the color of the cells in the second to last row and placing the new cells on the top of the grid symmetrically with respect to the center of the grid.\\\\n43. To make the output, you have to copy the band of colored squares near the bottom in a reverse order and paste it onto the top empty squares so that it mirrors across the middle horizontal line. The copied squares do not overwrite the existing colored squares.\\\\n44. To make the output, you should start with the input grid, then for each black cell in the grid, if there is a colored cell directly beneath it, replace the black cell with the color of cell in the middle of the row directly beneath it.\\\\n45. To make the output, you have to mirror the bottom shape diagonally to the top portion of the grid such that the two mirrored images meet at the center line. The mirrored image should maintain the colors from the original shape but ignore the black boxes from the top portion of the grid.\\\\n46. To make the output grid, take a look at the smaller cross in the input grid. Place the values of this smaller cross symmetrically into the black space above the larger cross in the output grid - essentially mirroring the smaller cross.   Note: The center point of the larger cross should align with the bottom points of the mirrored smaller cross in the output grid. And, if there are no values in the spots you are placing values into, just put in a value of 0 (black).\\\\n47. To make the output, you have to draw a mirror image of the middle part of the lower section in the input to the upper part in the output. The rest of the upper part of the Cell grid remains black. The lower part of the grid remains the same. The direction of the mirror image is from the bottom to top.\\\\n48. To create the output grid from the input grid, replicate the color and the V pattern from the bottom of the grid to the center of the top half of the grid. More specifically, copy the color of the cell in the center of the bottom hourglass, then draw two diagonals radiating from the center towards the upper corners. The length of the diagonals should be one less than half the grid\\\\\\'s height. Fill these diagonals with the chosen color.\\\\n49. To get the output, replicate the shape of the second color with the third color in the upper half of the grid, following the same pattern of the cross. Do this in a way that mirrors its original location in the lower half of the grid. Specifically, reflect each point in the second color over a horizontal line passing through the center of the grid. The rest of the grid remains unchanged.\\\\n50. To make the output, you have to mirror the innermost square upwards so that its color appears in the same locations in the black area opposite its position. The position is mirrored symmetrically according to the center row of the grid. The colour of the rest of the grid remains unchanged.\\\\n51. To make the output, you need to do two steps:     - Step1:  Spread the color of the center outwards to form a new cross that intersects the existing one at the center point. The new cross should be diagonal from corner to corner of the grid.     -Step 2: If a cell of the new cross overlaps with the original one, it retains the color of the original  cross. The color of the center of the crosses remains unchanged.\\\\n52. To make the output, you have to mirror the bottom \"arrow\" onto the top of the grid. The colors remain the same and follow orientation from the bottom arrow. The middle part of the grid (if any) remains black.\\\\n53. To make the output, you have to take the bottom-most coloured number and mirror it vertically across the horizontal axis of the grid, replacing the black cells with this number in the respective mirrored positions.\\\\n54. To make the output, you have to reflect the arrangement of colors/numbers in the last row of the grid in the vacant rows above, without changing the original color configuration. This is done by mirroring the color configuration along the horizontal axis, positioned in the middle of the grid. The colors from the last row replace their corresponding empty black cells. The mirrored color configuration doesn\\\\\\'t overwrite the already placed colors in the grid.\\\\n55. To create the output, the pattern is found in the middle row of the input grid where a horizontal line of colored squares is presented. The color of the horizontal line is replaced with the color of the last square (the highest point of pyramid). Thus, the color square in the middle at the top of the pyramid is copied and mirrored on both sides along the diagonally radiating black lines above the horizontal line of the pyramid in the input grid. The rest of the grid remains the same as the input.\\\\n56. To make the output, you have to copy the color and position of the colored squares closer to the center and place it following diagonals, onto cells that were black in the input. The original colored cells remain unchanged. All other cells remain black.\\\\n57. To make the output, you have to mirror the color pattern from the bottom rows to top rows. The new mirrored pattern should replace the black blocks in the top rows. In the mirrored pattern, the colors of the blocks should also be mirrored in order. Any block that was black in the original pattern should remain black.\\\\n58. To make the output, you have to \\\\\\'mirror\\\\\\' the color of the top pixels in last row before the row of color sequence, keeping the relative positions. If there are any color pixels at the middle rows of the grid, mirror them above the middle of grid.\\\\n59. To produce the output, if we imagine two diagonal lines going from the top left to the bottom right and top right to the bottom left, we have to fill the intersection of these lines in the black portion of the grid with the color contained at the center of the bottom stripe of the input grid.\\\\n60. The transformation depends on the colors of the horizontally and vertically aligned parts of the cross. You should take the color of the horizontal bar from the plus sign and fill the corresponding parts of the vertical bar in the top half of the grid, provided that the cells were initially black. A similar task should be performed by taking the color of the vertical bar from the plus sign and filling the corresponding parts of the horizontal bar in the left half of the grid, keeping in mind that only cells which were initially black should be colored. The bottom and right halves of the grid remain the same.\\\\n61. The transformation rules involve two steps. Firstly, find the digit in the center of the row with three different digits. This digit will be used later. Secondly, on the rows between the colored rows, place this digit on the same column as the colored digits from the row with the same digit. These digits should create a symmetrical pattern. All other cells should remain black.\\\\n62. To make the output, you have to create a reflected pattern above the center squares of the shape, with the color of the innermost square of the shape. The pattern should be like an arrow head pointing up. The center of this arrow head starts from the middle of the line just above the colored shape. For a given column, the further away from the vertical center line, the shorter the arrow head. Only draw on black squares and keep the colored squares below the arrow head unaffected.\\\\n63. To make the output, you have to take the lowest non-black value in the bottom half of the grid (excluding the very bottom row) and replicate its formation in the respective location in the upper half of the grid. The rest remains unchanged.\\\\n64. To make the output, you have to reflect the shapes in the bottom half above the middle row. If the shape is in the middle of the grid, keep it as it is. The reflection follows a horizontal axis going through the middle of the grid.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "After analyzing the rules, they can be categorized into eight distinct categories based on their similarities:\n\n1.

For each category, synthesize the rules into a single, specific rule that combines the ideas of all rules in that category, while clearly differentiating it from the other categories.\\\\nThe new rule should be as specific as possible, following the format of the given rules.\\\\nThe new rule should be applicable without any information from the original rules - i.e. it should be standalone.\\\\n\\\\nRules:\\\\n1. To make the output, take the color of the rectangle border in the input grid, and fill the entire output grid with that color. Then, if there is a colored square in the middle of the rectangle in the input grid, place it in the center of the output grid with the same color. Each of the squares in the output grid should be the same size regardless of the size of the original rectangle. The rectangle and the square always have the same height in the input grid. Do not include any of the black cells from the input grid.\\\\n2. To make the output, you have to understand that the number/colors in the input pattern (square in the center of the grid) get transformed in the output.  - Each grey cell in the input becomes a blue cell in the output. - The blue cell in the input becomes a black cell in the output. - The color transformation for other unique numbered cell(s) in the input pattern remains the same in the output.\\\\n3. To make the output, you have to replace the color of the outer square with the color of the inner square\\'s center. The color of the inner square remains the same, and if there is a different color at the center of the inner square in the input grid, it stays the same in the output grid as well.\\\\n4. To make the output, you have to remove all the black tiles from the input and resize the remaining coloured square to fit the output grid size. The colours are preserved in the output.\\\\n5. To make the output, look for the color of the center cell in the square. Fill all the cells in the output grid with this color, except that the center cell of the output grid should be yellow, if there is a yellow center cell in the input grid.\\\\n6. To make the output, you need to find the shape within the input grid that is not surrounded by black cells (background), and then upscale this shape by replacing the boundary cells with the boundary color and the inner cells with the inner color. If the shape is an odd amount of cells (like 3x3), then the central cell in the output grid should be same as the center cell from the input grid.\\\\n7. To make the output, you have to create a grid of the same size as the colored square in the input grid and fill it with the color of the square\\'s border. In case of a different color in the center of the input square, keep that same color in the corresponding location of the output grid.\\\\n8. To make the output, you find the smallest rectangular shape in the input that is not composed of black boxes. Keep same positions of colored squares in that rectangle but change black boxes to the color used for the border of that rectangle. Replace the central box with the color it had in the input and keep the color of other boxes the same as the color of the border. Create a rectangle with the same relative position of each box.\\\\n9. The transformation involves the color swap where the squares of the primary color in the input grid switches their color to match that of the secondary color on the input grid in the output. The secondary color in the input grid changes to the primary color in the output.\\\\n10. The output grid is comprised of the medium and smallest squares only. The color of the outer square in the output corresponds to the color of the smallest square in the original input, while the color of the inner square in the output matches the color of the medium square from the input grid.\\\\n11. To make the output, you need to extract the square of colored cells from the center of the input grid. The extracted square should then be transformed such that the border color becomes the primary color and the inner color should only be represented if it is different in the input grid. The black cells in the input grid should be ignored.\\\\n12. To make the output, change every single cell that\\'s the same color as the periphery of the shape in the input grid to the color of the central shape in the output grid. Change every cell that\\'s the same color as the central shape in the input to the color of the central pixel in the input grid. In other words, swap the color of the periphery and the central pixel.\\\\n13. To make the output, you have to find the colored shape in the grid. This shape will be outlined by one color and filled with another color, with a single cell somewhere in the middle being a different color. The output should be a 5x5 grid with the outline and filler colors all changed to the color of the middle cell. The cell in the very middle should retain the original filler color.\\\\n14. To get the output, replace all the border cells of the initial bigger square with the color of the center block from the smaller square and leave the center as it was.\\\\n15. To make the output grid, ignore all the black cells. Replace the color of the outer border cells with the color of the central cell mentioned in the input. End up with a grid equal size to the combined colored cells from the input grid, where all external border cells have the color of the central cell and the remaining cells keep their original color.\\\\n16. To make the output, you have to replace the color of the cells. Specifically, replace the cells which form the outline of the square and the center cells with the color of the square\\'s corners. The cells which do not fulfill any of these conditions take the color of the center of the square. Therefore, in the output grid, the cells in the outline have the color of the corners of the input square and, the other cells take the color from the center of the input square.\\\\n17. To obtain the output, first, you need to locate the frame of the shape. The frame seems to be always surrounded by black cells. The whole frame is then shrunk into a 1 cell thick line, making the frame and the framed area 1 cell wide. The colors of the cells inside the frame become the inside of the output shape, while the colors of the frame become the outline color in the output. It\\'s possible to shrink the shape by vertically and horizontally averaging the color in every 4 cell regions if the color of the corresponding position within the frame or inside it is not black. You preserve and maintain its symmetrical square or rectangular form. You do not need to consider black cells (0\\'s) when computing the average.\\\\n18. To make the output, you have to replace color of the large square with color inside the smaller square. The size of the grid is reduced to the size of the original large square and black grids are discarded.\\\\n19. To make the output, you have to take the color of the border of the square in the input grid and fill the whole output grid with that color. Then, if there\\'s a different colored point inside the square in the input grid, place that point in the same position in the output grid but surrounded by the border color.\\\\n20. To transform the grid, keep the overall color scheme of the square in the input grid but reduce its size. If the original square had a different color in the center, keep this color in the reduced version as well but change every other color to fuchsia.\\\\n21. To make the output, you need to replace the color that forms the boundary of the rectangle with the color that fills the center of the rectangle and replace the color that is the center of the rectangle with the color of the boundary. In the case that there is only one color in the rectangle (regardless of whether there is a boundary or not), then the rectangle is filled with this color.\\\\n22. To make the output, you have to upscale the middle plus shape of the input by one layer and color the upscaled part with color of outer square from input. If there\\'s a third different color in the center of the cross, leave it as it is in the center of the upscaled shape.\\\\n23. To make the output, you have to recreate the inner square, but the border color and the middle color should be mirrored (i.e., if in the input the border color is on the inside and the middle color is in the center, it should be the other way around in the output), all other cells should be filled with the border color.\\\\n24. To make the output, you have to follow these steps:  1. Identify the colored square in the input. Exclude any black tiles outside the square.  2. Replace the color of the square sides with the color of the square corner or the most abundant color.  3. The different color in the middle should remain the same.  If there is no different color in the middle of the square in the input, the square in the output should be entirely filled with the color of the square corners.\\\\n25. To transform the input into the output, you select the large colored square and replace each cell in it with the color of the small square in its center. The center cell in the output grid takes the color of the center cell from the input grid.\\\\n26. To make the output, you have to locate the colored square in the input grid, then invert the colors of the colored squares. The rectangular area in the center gets transformed into the output grid in such a way that the cells filled with the dominant color in the input become black, and the cells filled with the different color in the input become colored in the output grid. The color for these cells in the output grid should be the color of the outline in the colored square from the input grid.\\\\n27. In the output grid, color all cells with the color of the distinct square in the input. Then replace the cell that corresponds to the distinct square with the color of the rectangle in the input.\\\\n28. To make the output, you have to flip the color of the outermost layer of the square to the color of different-colored boxes within the square from the input. Then keep the color of middle layer of the square same from the input. Any different-colored boxes within the square remain the same color.\\\\n29. To make the output, you shall first locate the colored square or rectangle shape in the input grid, then transform this internally colored coherent shape to an output square where background black cells are replaced by the color found in the edge of the internal shape and the non-edge cells are replaced by the different color present.\\\\n30. The output doesn\\'t use the entire grid but only the core grid. Starting from just outside the colored blocks, you have to condense the grid around the colored zones by dividing the dimensions by 3 and changing the color of the cells around the center shape to the color of the center shape itself.\\\\n31. The pattern of transformation requires repacking the colored square grid from the input grid and placing it onto an independent grid to form the output. Within the new grid, the colors of all the cells are changed to the color of the perimeter cells from the input square grid, except for the central cell which retains its original color.\\\\n32. To transform the input grid into the output, you have to select the colored shape, replace the boundary color with the color in the center of the shape, and create a new grid of the same size with the new colors. The color in the center of the new grid should be the same as the interior color of the shape in the input grid.\\\\n33. To transform the input to the output you need to remove all black boxes from the input grid, keeping the colored shape exactly as it is. The different colored central square of the shape becomes the color of the border squares and the non-central squares become the same color as the central square. If the central box in the shape is black, the box in the same location in the output is also black.\\\\n34. To make the output, you have to carve out the inner square, retaining the same colors. The square should include the corner colors and the central colored or black cells, but must exclude any same colored cells extending beyond the corner color. It should have black color to replace the corners and the border with the color of the corners in the input.\\\\n35. To make the output, first identify the colored box inside the input grid and determine its color. If there is a different colored row or column inside the box, it should be placed in the same location in the output, but keeping its color. The rest of the cells in the output grid should be filled with the color of the box from the input grid. Ignore all the black cells of the input when creating the output.\\\\n36. To make the output, you have to first locate the colored shape in the input grid. The colored shape isn\\'t always at the same spot or the same size. However, it will always have the most cells of one color. This color shapes the border and fills the interior of the output shape. The color of the single cell, which has a different color in the input grid, retains its color in the output grid. This results in an output shape which mainly consists of the majority color from the input, with a cell of a different color located in the same relative position.\\\\n37. To make the output, you have to create a new grid with the same size as the colored square in the input. Fill the whole output grid with the color of the outer layer of the square in the input. Fill the inner square in the output grid with the color of the inner square in the input, and put the color of the center square in the input at the same position in the output.\\\\n38. To make the output, you have to extract the color pattern square from the input. Then each colored cell within the square, including the differently colored centre cell, should be changed to the color of the periphery cells present in the input, with exception for them being black which indicates that they are not part of the color square. The black cells stay black in the output.\\\\n39. To make the output, you have to zoom the inner shape of the primary square (including its color) to be able to fill all the cells of the output grid. The color of the smaller shape in the primary square fills the corners of the output image, while the color of the primary square forms a plus sign in the middle of the output image. Exchange the color of primary and inner shapes within the shape. The color code of the inner smaller shape changes to the primary shape\\'s color code and vice versa.\\\\n40. To transform the input into the output, start by isolating the colored rectangle in the center of the input. The outside border of this rectangle becomes the outside border of the output grid. Any differently colored pixels within the rectangle become the similarly located pixels in the output grid. The rest of the pixels in the output grid take on the color of the border of the rectangle in the input grid.\\\\n41. To make the output, remove all the black space from the input grid. Then, replace the colors in the remaining square by a single color. If all cells in a row are the same color, such as red or blue, replace them with grey; but if the row contains a colored cell that is different, such as a green cell among blue cells, replace all the cells in that row with the color of the different cell.\\\\n42. To make the output, you have to shrink the grid to only the size of the colored shape, keeping all the information of this shape. The color of the outer square will be applied to the whole shape in the output, with the inner square remaining as it was in the inner square of the input.\\\\n43. To make the output, you need to pick the color from the inside of the square pattern (not from the cross), and fill the outer areas of the output grid to create a border. Then pick the color from the cross in the input, and use it to fill the inner region of the output grid. Where the cross color intersects with the inner square color, the cross color takes precedence.\\\\n44. To make the output, you have to turn the largest square of colored cells into a square of cells with the color of the smallest square of colored cells in the input grid. The position of the smallest square inside the largest square will be maintained, and its color will remain the same.\\\\n45. To make the output, you have to extract the colored geometric shape found in the input. Then, transform the color of the extracted shape into the unique color that is different from the dominating color within the shape. If the dominating color exists at the center of the extracted shape, keep the color the same. Finally, the extracted shape with its new color becomes the output grid.\\\\n46. To make the output, you have to locate the square shape in the input grid and copy it into the output grid, but replace the color of the square shape (not the center cell, if it has a different color) with the color of the center cell or innermost ring.\\\\n47. To transform the grid, locate the inner colored square in the input grid and remove the black cells. The result is the colored square. Note the unique color of the center cell is maintained in the output grid.\\\\n48. To make the output, you have to detect the shape in the input grid, take squares without black cells that compose the shape, and copy the colors on these cells to the output grid, filling additional cells around these colors to form squares the same size as the detected shape with the color of the outline of the detected shape.\\\\n49. To achieve the output, you need to find the colored rectangle in the input grid, change the outer and surrounding color of the rectangle to the color of the center cell in the rectangle and reduce the grid to the size of this rectangle.\\\\n50. The output grid is formed by taking the center 5x5 square from the input pattern, then replacing the color all around the edges of the pattern square with the color of the center cell in the input. The central cell in the output pattern square remains the same color as it was in the input pattern square.\\\\n51. To make the output, you have to extract the colored shape from the input grid. Change the color of the cells without the single different cell to color of the single different cell inside the shape found in the input. Finally, Shrink the grid by removing any empty spaces, maintaining the shape of the colored form.\\\\n52. The transformation rule of this grid is to remove everything except the square found in the input grid and add an additional color or the same color around the original square in the output. If the colored dot inside the original small square of the input grid is present, it should be retained in the middle of the output grid.\\\\n53. The transformation from input to output seems to involve keeping the shape and pattern of the figure that is not black in the input grid but inverting its colors. The outer ring color in the input becomes the new color for the inside cells in the output, and the innermost color in the input becomes the new color for the boundary of the shape in the output.\\\\n54. To make the output, you have to rebuild the colored square in the correct size and use every unique color from the input square. The position of the colors should match their positions in the input. The rest of the squares should be filled with the color that is most commonly used in the input colored square.\\\\n55. To make the output, you have to copy the colored square from the input, but replace all the cells of the square\\'s color with the color of the inner square. The color of the inner square remains the same in the output.\\\\n56. To make the output, you have to find the colored square in the input and replicate it in a smaller size with the center color preserved (if it exists). The border color of the output square changes to the center color of the input square.\\\\n57. To make the output, you have to eliminate the black space around the colored rectangle. Then, switch the colors within the rectangle so that the color of the surrounding boxes changes to the color of the central square and vice versa.\\\\n58. To make the output, you have to extract the colored square from the input grid and transform it by changing the color of all squares that aren\\'t part of the central line to the color of the squares that form the outer border of the colored square. The squares in the central line remain the same color they were in the input grid.\\\\n59. To make the output, invert the colors of the rectangle found in the input grid. Subsequently, the color transformations are as follows: red becomes green, yellow becomes purple, and green becomes yellow.\\\\n60. To make the output, you have to scale down the colored shape present in the input into a smaller grid. The colors of squares inside the shape are maintained without black border. Only central part is scaled down. If there are additional colors on the same location, the lower number color overwrites a higher number color. That signifies a higher ranking of the lower number color on the same location over the higher number color.\\\\n61. To make the output, you have to scale down the pattern. Record the color variations within the internal section of the larger square but ignore the surrounding black space. Adjust the colors within the smaller square such that each cell is filled with the maximum color number from the original cell and its surrounding cells.\\\\n62. To make the output, you have to take the colored surrounding square from the input and replace it with the color of the smaller square in its center. The resulting square should have a single colored square in its center, which is from the center of the smallest square in the input.\\\\n\"}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "Category 1: Rules involving color transformation\n- Rules: 2, 9, 12, 26, 28, 39, 46, 53, 59, 61\n- Synthesized Rule: To make the output, identify the primary and secondary colors in the input grid.

To make the output grid, the inner region of the rectangle is filled with with a red color. This inner region is one cell away from the edge of its surrounding grey rectangle. If the grey rectangle is less than 4 cells wide or high, then it does not change.\\\\n2. To make the output, you have to find the inner 3x3 blocks of grey and change them to red, leaving a grey border around them. If such a 3x3 block does not exist within the grey pattern, leave it unchanged.\\\\n3. To produce the output, you have to replace the middle portion of any solid grey block with the color red, which means that only the border of the block should remain grey and the rest should become red. This transformation applies to any grey block that appears in the input grid.\\\\n4. To make the output, you have to transform the interior of each grey square region into red except the boundary cells of the region, making it look like a frame. The thickness of the frame is one cell. All other cells that are not part of the grey region remain the same.\\\\n5. To make the output, you have to change the colour of the grey box inner area to red, while the border remain grey. The black area or line separating the blocks remains the same. The transformation can be thought as adding a red border of width one box around the inner area of each grey block in the input grid.\\\\n6. To make the output, the rule involves transforming the internal cells of the fully grey squares into red. Leaving the external ring of the grey squares intact. Then maintain all black cells as is.\\\\n7. To make the output, you have to change the inner cells of the gray figure(s) into red ones, while leaving the perimeter of the figure(s) gray. For a figure with a center, only the central cell should be left gray.\\\\n8. For transforming the grid, replace the grey squares in the core of each grey block, 1 square away from its edge with red squares, while the perimeters, border squares adjacent to black, are kept as grey squares. Remainder of the grid is kept consistent with the original.\\\\n9. The grid is transformed by taking the inner square of cells (leaving a border of cells of thickness 1 around the square) inside these big squares that have a border of at least 1 cell wide around them and changing the cell color from gray to red.\\\\n10. To transform the grid, keep the most exterior line of grey cells as it is, and transform all interior grey cells into red cells. This pattern creates a grey frame filled with red. All the black cells remain black.\\\\n11. To transform the input grid to the output grid, in each grey block excluding the outermost layer, turn the grey squares into red squares.\\\\n12. The transformation rule involves the grey cells in the input grid. A group of grey cells that form a 1 cell border on the input are left as grey on the output grid but the cells in the interior of the grey figures are transformed to red cells. Hence, you introduce Red cells amidst the grey cells, these red cells being surrounded by the grey cells.\\\\n13. The transformation involves changing the inner grey squares, excluding the border, of the \\'book-like\\' figure to red. It appears the figures take on a characteristic of filling where the red color represents the pages of the \\'book\\'. The transformation keeps the outer grey border intact whilst changing the inner color to red. This pattern is consistent across multiple samples.\\\\n14. In order to get the output, the grey-colored rectangles in the middle area need to be filled out with red-colored squares (2), except the outermost layer of the rectangles.\\\\n15. To make the output, you keep the perimeter of the shape gray (5) and the inside you change to red (2). If the grid square was already black (0), it stays black.\\\\n16. To make the output, you have to examine each cluster of grey cells. If the cluster is a square or rectangle, then alter the color of the cells that are not on the border of the shape to red while leaving the border cells as grey. All the black cells remain black in the output grid.\\\\n17. The transformation involves changing the color of the cells inside the grey rectangles. If the rectangle has a black cell border direct to its top or right side, then every interior cell (those not at the border of the rectangle) should be turned red. If there\\'s no black cell border direct to its top or right side, keep the gray color for the interior cells.\\\\n18. To make the output, you have to draw a smaller red square inside each grey square such that the red square is surrounded by a one-block wide border of the grey squares on all sides. There are no changes made to any cells outside of the grey square areas.\\\\n19. To make the output, you have to change the color of the inner cells of the digit or letter from grey to red while the outer cells remain the same. This results in the digit or letter showing a red outline against the black cells and filled with red cells in the center.\\\\n20. To make the output grey square is transformed into a 5x4 rectangle in which the outer layer remains grey (5), but the inner squares are replaced with red (2). This is done for all occurrences of the grey square in the grid. There are no changes for the black squares.\\\\n21. To make the output, you have to take each grey rectangular shape in the input grid. In the center part of each rectangle but leaving the perimeter, color the cells red. If the rectangle has any sub-rectangular area, apply the same process to it as well. Leave all other cells the same color as they were in the input.\\\\n22. To make the output, you have to change the color of the inner part of the squares from grey to red while keeping the outer frame of the squares grey. The inner part is defined as starting from the second grey square from every direction within one square. If there are two squares in the grid, both should be treated separately.\\\\n23. .The pattern change involves the middle three cells, on every row of each grey-colored block. These middle three cells are changed to red. For blocks that have an even number of cells in the row, the middle two (i.e., the 3rd and 4th cells from either end) should be changed to red instead. The rest of the grid remain the same.  The steps can be summarized in the following way: 1. Identify the blocks of contiguous grey squares in each row and remember their start and end positions. 2. If the size of the block is greater or equal to 5. Replace the middle three cells with red. If the size of the block is even and greater or equal to 4. Replace the middle two cells with red. 3. Repeat this process for the full grid.\\\\n24. To make the output, you have to assess the internally situated gray pixels of the shapes identified in the input. Replace all the gray pixels, excluding those on the border of these shapes, with red ones. Meanwhile, keep every black pixel and the gray border pixels from the input grid.\\\\n25. To make the output, you have to apply the following logic. Keep the black cells as they are. On the grey areas, replace the interior with red, while the border of the rectangle remains grey. A cell is considered to be a border if it has a neighboring black cell. If the cell is surrounded by grey or red cells, consider it an interior cell and replace it with red.\\\\n26. To create the output, inside every second (from left to right and top to bottom) same color area with a black border, you turn every gray square, except the border, into red.\\\\n27. To make the output, you have to maintain the outer grey layer as it is and transform all the grey squares inside that outer layer into red squares. The cells which do not have a grey color should remain the same.\\\\n28. To make the output, you have to transform the interior squares of each grey shape (box or line) to a red square, leaving the border of the shapes still grey.\\\\n29. To make the output, you have to start from the second row (or column) of each grey square and continue until the second last row (or column). Replace any grey squares in this region with red. The first and last row (or column) of grey squares should remain grey. Note that this pattern applies both vertically and horizontally.\\\\n30. To create the output, first you need to find the grey rectangles in the input. These rectangles will remain in the same position in the output. However, transform the inner cells of these rectangles, not touching the boundary, into red cells. Everything else should remain black.\\\\n31. To generate the output, you need to transform any grey rectangle in the input by replacing its inner cells with red. The outer boundary of the rectangle remains grey. Specifically, any grey cell that is surrounded on all four sides (up, down, left and right) by either grey or black cells should be changed to red. Leave all other cells as they are.\\\\n32. To produce the output, we have to apply the rule as follows: find the grey rectangular shapes in the grid. For each rectangle, change the color of the inner cells to be red, keeping the border cells grey. The border of each rectangle is the single layer of cells that form the extreme outer boundary of the rectangle. If there is nothing or a black cell directly adjacent to a grey cell (including diagonally), then it is a border cell.\\\\n33. To make the output, you have to change the second and third grey squares from the border to red for all the regions where the squares are arranged as rectangles. If the rectangle of grey squares is in the center and connected to the border of the grid, only change the grey squares that are second from the border. If the rectangle is isolated and not connected to the border of the grid, change the second and third grey squares from the border.\\\\n34. To transform, we look at the gray rectangles in the input grid. The transformation rules are:  1) If the block of gray cells is a full row or column, leave them entirely as gray (5). 2) For every other block of gray cells, the inner squares/ cells (not on the borders of rectangle) become red (2). 3) If the rectangle is 1 cell wide (i.e., a straight line), leave it as gray (5). 4) All black cells are preserved from the input to the output.\\\\n35. To get the output, the transformation involves changing the color of cells in the interior of any grey rectangle in the input to red. The border cells of the rectangle, however, remain grey. The rest of the cells stay the same as in the input grid.\\\\n36. To make the output, you have to replace the inner square or strip of the gray square or strip with red boxes. The inner cells are defined as those which directly border with black cells in the outer square or strip.\\\\n37. To make the output, you have to apply a pattern inside the grey squares. Keep the border of the grey blocks the same and transform the inner cells into red. If the grey area is single width or height, leave it unchanged.\\\\n38. To make the output, you have to replace the inner grey boxes with red boxes, keeping the outer layer intact. The inner boxes are the ones that are surrounded by other grey boxes on all four sides.\\\\n39. To make the output, you have to replace the second layer of grey boxes in each rectangle with red boxes, except for the corners which are to remain as grey boxes.\\\\n40. To make the output, you have to identify the grey boxes in the input grid. For each grey box, make a boundary of grey color (the value 5) and fill the internal part of the box with red color (the value 2). Leave the other elements of the grid as in the input.\\\\n41. Transform the input grid to the output by replacing the grey blocks in the inside (second layer from the outer boundary) of the shape with red blocks, leaving the outermost boundary of the grey shape unmodified. Do not modify the black blocks.\\\\n42. To create the output from the input, you have to convert the middle three rows of each grey rectangle to red. If there\\'s another rectangle inside of the original one, the inner one should be converted back to grey.\\\\n43. To transform the input grid into the output grid, identify the grey 5x5 blocks. In each of these blocks, the inner 3x3 block is transformed to a red color, while the outer single layer boundary keeps the grey color. If there are no grey squares, the squares remain unchanged. The black squares also remain unchanged throughout the process.\\\\n44. To obtain the output, the pattern is to identify a square of grey cells surrounded by the black cells. Except for the border, convert the middle cells of the square into red cells.\\\\n45. To make the output, you have to identify the grey squares that form a solid block without any black square within. For each of these blocks, change the color of the center squares from grey to red. The center is defined as the area that would be left after removing one ring of squares from the edge of the block. If the block is only one square wide or one square high, do not change its color.\\\\n46. To make the output, you have to change the inner color of the rectangles. The outermost grey line of each of the rectangles should remain the same, but the three inner lines should be turned red, leaving only the rectangle\\'s border in grey. In cases where there are less than three inner lines due to the rectangle size, all inner grey cells should turn red.\\\\n47. Find all connected areas surrounded by black (0) cells that are filled with grey (5). For these grey shape areas, replace the inner cells leaving only one cell-wide grey border. Replace these inner cells with red (2) cells. The remaining cells of the grid should be left as they are. All grey cells that are not part of a valid shape (not surrounded by black 0 cells) should be left as such.\\\\n48. The transformation seems to be that the inner part of the grey rectangles is becoming red while the border remains grey. This inner part seems to be the rectangle that would result from removing a 1 cell-wide border from the original rectangle if it can be reached vertically and horizontally. If an inner part of the rectangle doesn\\'t have surrounding grey cells in vertical or horizontal then it remains gray. There should be at least 1 grey cell that separates two red filled rectangles.\\\\n49. To make the output, you have to replace the colour gray in the inner rectangle with red and leave the other part of the main rectangle with gray and the rest of the cells, black. This applies for both stand alone rectangles and rectangles within rectangles.\\\\n50. To make the output, take the pixels in the grey blocks and if they are not on the edge, change their color to red. Do this for all grey blocks in the input image.\\\\n51. To make the output, you have to keep the same structure but ensure that the central squares of each gray rectangle are changed to red. If there is a middle bar composed of grey squares, then the central squares of that bar should also be changed to red.\\\\n52. The transformation changes the three center rows of each grey block on the input to red in the output.\\\\n53. To produce the output grid from the input grid, maintain the outer frame of the gray squares untouched but replace every interior gray square (squares that have grey squares on both sides horizontally or vertically) with red squares.\\\\n54. To transform the input into the output, maintain the outer border of the grey block as it is. Change the inner block of grey to red while maintaining a single grey border inside. It\\'s like making a border or frame around the grey block. Leave any black spaces as is.\\\\n55. To make the output, keep the outer grey squares the same and change the inner grey squares to red. Outside the rectangle remains black.\\\\n56. In the output, the transformation forms a red cross at the centre of each rectangular shape while preserving the outer border of the original rectangles.   Specifically, the grey-colored cells that are located at the center of each rectangular formation are shaded red (turned into 2\\'s) in the output. A cell is said to be a \\'center cell\\' if it has four grey-colored cells as neighbours (up, down, left and right) within the same rectangular structure. The corners and edge borders retain the original grey color.\\\\n57. To make the output, you have to transform the interior grey cells of the box into red cells, keeping the outer boundary cells as grey. The box shape is defined as the outermost populated region of cells. Only continue the pattern on the contained regions if it takes up more than 50% of the height or width of the entire grid.\\\\n58. To make the output, you have to change the color of the interior cells (those that are not on the edge) from grey to red in these rectangular shapes.\\\\n59. To produce the output grid, replace the interior body of the grey squares with number 2 (red), leaving a 1-cell thick border of number 5 (grey) around them. The rest of the grid (the black cells) remains the same.\\\\n60. To make the output, you have to keep the grey squares that form the perimeter of each grey rectangle of the input grid unchanged. For those grey squares that are inside the rectangle but not part of the perimeter, you should change them into red squares. This rule applies to all rectangles.\\\\n61. To make the output, you have to change the interior grey cells of the box to red, keeping the outline of the box as grey. The interior cells are those which are surrounded from all four sides (up, down, left, and right) by a grey or black cell.\\\\n62. To make the output, you have to identify the gray shape or shapes and turn the inner cells of the gray shape into red, leaving the border cells as gray. If there is a black line dividing the grey shape, treat each segment as a separate shape.\\\\n63. To make the output, you have to maintain the outer layer of the grey stripes in the same position, but change the inner part of these stripes to red cells. This is done by leaving the first and last row/column of the grey shapes the same, and changing the inner cells in between to red.\\\\n64. To make the output grid, you should identify the grey squares directly bordering a black square, except for the ones at the two ends of the grey square group, and color those squares in red. The grey squares bordering the ends of the square group should still remain grey. If a square is not part of a group, it should remain as it is.\\\\n\"}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "After analyzing the rules, they can be categorized into eight distinct categories based on their similarities.

For each category, synthesize the rules into a single, specific rule that combines the ideas of all rules in that category, while clearly differentiating it from the other categories.\\\\nThe new rule should be as specific as possible, following the format of the given rules.\\\\nThe new rule should be applicable without any information from the original rules - i.e. it should be standalone.\\\\n\\\\nRules:\\\\n1. To make the output, you have to .take the colors from the exterior to the interior. In other words, the outermost layer color is replaced with the color of one layer inside in the input grid. This rule applies recursively to the inner layers until you reach the center. The center then takes the color of the outermost border. You follow this pattern regardless of the number of layers in the grid.\\\\n2. To make the output, make the color of the outermost square the new color of the entire grid, except for a 1-cell border around it that will be colored in the color of the 2nd concentric square from the outside of the input. Continue this pattern for the inner squares, always maintaining a 1 cell border with the previous border\\'s color.\\\\n3. To make the output, you have to flip the colors of the border and filler. The color that was the outer border would now become the filler for the center, the color that was the filler for the outer border would now become the inner border, the color that was the inner border would now become the filler for the outer border, and the color that was the filler for the center would now become the outer border.\\\\n4. To make the output, you have to invert the colors. Replace the green color(second outermost layer) in the input grid with black color in the output grid. Replace the red color (second innermost layer) in the input grid with green color in the output grid. Replace the black color (innermost layer) with red color. There\\'s an exception though, the cells of the boundaries of the grids always remain black regardless of its original color in the output grid.\\\\n5. To form the output, swap the two most prominent colors on the grid: the color that fills the outermost square and the color that fills the innermost square. All other colors remain the same.\\\\n6. To make the output, you have to invert the colors of the squares. The color of outer periphery becomes the color of inner most square and vice versa. The color of the second outermost layer is retained in the same position in the output.\\\\n7. To make the output, you have to change the color of the squares following this way: Every square of the outermost color becomes the innermost color from the input. Every square of the innermost color becomes the outermost color. Every other square maintains its color. If there is a colored block in the center, it keeps its color. If the center block is black, it becomes the color of the outermost color.\\\\n8. To make the output, you have to invert the colors of the entire grid. The color that was in the original outer most square should fill the entire frame in the output. The black strip should remain but is now colored with the color that was in the original inner square. The inner square should be colored black if it was originally monochrome or have the original frame color if it contained a pattern.\\\\n9. To make the output, you need to invert the input. The color black becomes the outer border color, the outer border color becomes the inner ring color and the inner ring color becomes the color black. The colors inside the inner ring should remain the same.\\\\n10. To make the output, swap the colors of the outermost and the middle square, leaving the color of the innermost square the same.\\\\n11. To obtain the output square grid, you must perform an inversion of colors on the input square grid. The color of the input frame becomes the color of the center of the output. The color of the central square in the input becomes the color of the frame in the output. The black squares in the input remain black in the output grid.\\\\n12. To make the output, you have to switch the colors of the outer and inner layers of squares. Specifically, if a cell is black in the input, change it to the color of the innermost square in the input. If a cell is not black in the input, change it to the color of the outermost square in the input.\\\\n13. To make the output, you have to swap the color of cells that are at the same position in the input and output. Specifically, the outermost ring of cells becomes black, second outermost cells become green, third outermost cells become red, and the innermost cells become black.\\\\n14. To create the output grid, you need to invert the colours of the input grid while maintaining the same configuration structure. In other words, the colour that was previously on the outer layer should be placed on the most inner layer. The middle layer colour should be moved to the outer layer whilst the innermost layer colour should be moved to the middle layer. After this switch, the pattern configuration should appear as it did in the original grid.\\\\n15. To create the output, you have to change the colors of all the cells by inverting the input colors as follow: outer color becomes the color of the middle square in the input grid, and the middle color becomes the color of the outermost square in the input grid. Black color in the input becomes the color of the center cells of the middle square in the input grid, and the center cells become black in the output grid.\\\\n16. To make the output grid, switch the colors of the outermost layer (border) and the centermost layer (either a solid color or black). The middle layer retains its original color. If the central square was black, it should now take on the original border color. Effectively the transformation is a swap of the central square\\'s color with the border\\'s color.\\\\n17. The transformation involves swapping the colors such that the outermost color becomes the color of the innermost area, the color of the inner frame fills the outer frame and the color of innermost area fills the inner frame. Black squares remain black in case there are any.\\\\n18. To convert the input grid into the output, all the squares of outer border color should be replaced by the color of the inner square (not including black, consider black as no color) and all squares with color that fill the most part of the checkerboard square at the center should be replaced with the color of the outer border of the input grid.\\\\n19. For transforming the grid, invert the colors. If the current cell is of the outermost square color, it should be turned to black. If it\\'s of the inner square, replace it with the color of the outermost square. If it\\'s of the innermost square, replace it with the color of the second square (inner square). If its color is same as the outermost square found inside the innermost square, replace it with the color of the innermost square (black). Every cell of the outer color should become the color of the innermost square.\\\\n20. To make the output, you have to invert the colors of the input grid. Replace each green cell with a black cell and each red cell with a green cell. A green square is drawn around the previous square. Leave the hole untouched.\\\\n21. To make the output, replace the colors of each layer with the color of the layer directly inside it in the input. The innermost layer in the output takes its color from the second innermost layer of the input. If the innermost layer in the input is black, then the outermost layer in the output becomes black.\\\\n22. To make the output, you have to invert the colors of the squares. The outermost square takes the color of the innermost square, the second outermost takes the color of the second innermost and so on.\\\\n23. To make the output, you have to exchange the colors of the outer square with the innermost square. The middle square remains the same.\\\\n24. To obtain the output from the input, the color of each square in the grid, except for the innermost ones, should be swapped with the color of the square that it directly encloses (the square in its inner layer). The color of the innermost squares should remain the same.\\\\n25. In the output grid, the colors from the input are inverted so that the color of the outermost square in the input becomes the color of the square in the center of the grid in the output, and vice versa.   Fixed part of the transformation: The structure of the grid (square shape, arrangement of the colors) remains the same. The only thing that changes are the colors of the squares that are swapped.\\\\n26. To generate the output, swap the colours in the original grid. The larger square\\'s colour becomes the new innermost square\\'s colour, the nested square\\'s colour becomes the new larger square\\'s colour, and the innermost square\\'s colour becomes the new nested square\\'s colour. The black cells (color 0) retain their color.\\\\n27. To make the output, you have to swap the colors of the outer frame and the innermost color (the one inside the second frame color). If the innermost is black, replace it with the outer frame\\'s color. The second color frame remains the same.\\\\n28. To transform the input into the output, swap the colors of the background and the frame. All the other colors remain unchanged. So the color of the frame becomes the new background color and the former background color becomes the new frame color.\\\\n29. To produce the output, perform a color inversion operation. For each cell, replace the green cells with black cells, red cells with green cells, and black cells with red cells. Apply this transformation to all cells to get the output. When there is no corresponding color, e.g. the white cells in scenario 1, keep the same color.\\\\n30. The transformation consists of swapping the colors of the two inner squares while keeping the color of the middle square (if any) the same. The outermost border\\'s color changes to be the same as the old color of the interior of the innermost square.\\\\n31. The colors in the output grid shift towards the center from the original grid. The border color in the input becomes the color of the previously black rectangles, the color of the inner border in the input becomes the new border color in the output, and the color of the rectangles surrounded by the second color in the input becomes the new inner border color in the output. The black spaces in the original remain black in the output.\\\\n32. To create the output, swap the colors of the larger square and the smaller square. If the smallest square in the input is black, it should remain black in the output. If the smallest square is the same color as the larger square, it should be replaced in the output with the color of the smallest square from the input.\\\\n33. To make the output, you have to swap the colors of the outermost ring with the color of the innermost square, and leave the color of the inner ring as it is.\\\\n34. To create the output, swap the color of the outermost square with the color of the four small squares at the center of the grid. If the central squares are black, color the entire grid with the color of the outermost square. If the four central squares are not black and identical, then the color of each cell in the grid is replaced with the color of the outermost square of its equivalent position in the input grid.\\\\n35. The output grid color swaps the primary and secondary colors in the input grid. This includes the primary color becoming the central color of the secondary square, and the secondary color becoming the primary color of the grid\u2014if applicable. The black color in the input grid remains black in the output grid.\\\\n36. To make the output, you have to invert the colors of the squares following this rule: the color of the outermost square becomes the color of the innermost square, and vice versa. The color of the second outermost square becomes the color of the second innermost, and so on. Leave the center unchanged if there\\'s an uneven number of nested squares.\\\\n37. To make the output, you have to invert the color of the grid. The color in the outermost square (3rd color) in the input grid should fill the innermost square in the output grid. The color of the inner square (2nd color) in the input grid should fill the middle square of the output grid. The color of the innermost square (1st color) in the input grid should fill the outermost square of the output grid. Where there is no color in the input (represented by black), fill with the color of the outermost square (3rd color) of the output grid. Therefore, the final output grid should have inverted colors compared to the arrangement of the input grid.\\\\n38. To make the output, you have to replace the color of the outer square with the color of the inner square, and replace the color of the inner square with the color of the outer square. If the four corners of the inner square were originally the color of the largest square, they should be changed to match the color of the new inner square - effectively swapping the colors of the two squares, preserving the design.\\\\n39. To make the output, you have to reverse the colors from the Input grid. The outermost color becomes the innermost color, the middle color stays the same, and the innermost color becomes the outermost color. The layout stays the same, only the colors are switched.\\\\n40. If you look at the colors in the input grid, you\\'ll find the outermost ring is color 1, the next ring inwards is color 2, and then a third ring inward is color 3.   To generate the output grid, you should swap these colors in reverse order. Color 3 becomes the outermost color in the output, color 2 becomes the next ring in, and color 1 takes up the space of the previous color 3. If a grid begins with black (represented by the number 0), it remains black in the output. The same holds true for any color - it takes its new position from the opposite ring.\\\\n41. To create the output, you must swap the outermost and innermost square colors. The middle color remains unchanged.\\\\n42. To make the output, you need to invert the colors of the input grid. This means that the larger square and its border change to the color of the smaller square, while the smaller square and its border change to the color of the larger square. Additionally, any blocks outside the larger square should change to the color of the small square from the input.\\\\n43. To make the output, you have to switch the colors of the larger square frame and the innermost square. The color of the smaller square frame remains the same. If the innermost square was empty, fill it with the color of the larger square frame from the input grid.\\\\n44. To make the output, you have to swap the colors of the large border and small square. The color that fills the largest area in the input becomes the fill color for the smallest area in the output, and vice versa. If there is an innermost square in the input, its color should also be swapped correspondingly. The color that represents zero in the input becomes the edge color in the output.\\\\n45. To make the output, you have to inverse the color from the center outwards, meaning the color on the corners of the input grid should be the color filled in all the center square of the output grid. And vice versa, the color in the center square of the input grid should be the color on the corners of the output grid. The color of outer square in the input grid will fill in the second square from the center outwards in the output grid and so on until we fill in the entire output grid.\\\\n46. To make the output, you have to switch the outer ring color with the innermost color, the inner ring color remains the same.\\\\n47. To make the output, you have to invert the color scheme by swapping the colors over. The outermost color becomes the innermost color and vice versa. This applies to the inner frames as well, keeping the color from the outermost frame as it moves inward, and the color from the innermost frame as it moves outward.\\\\n48. To make the output, you have to invert the colors of each layer in the square. If the outermost layer in the input was the first color, change it to the color of the innermost square in the output. Similarly, if the innermost square in the input was the second color, change it to the color of the outermost square in the output. If there is a third color in the most inner square, keep it the same. Essentially, we are switching the colors of the outer and inner squares while maintaining a third color if it exists.\\\\n49. To make the output, you have to invert the colors of the corresponding positions. For example, if the outer ring is green and the inner ring is red, the output will have an outer ring of red and and inner ring of green. The black or third color in the inner most shape will also be exchanged with the color of the outer most ring.\\\\n50. To create the final grid, switch green with black and red with green in every cell.\\\\n51. The pattern involves swapping the colors of the encompassing squares. Starting from the outermost square, the color of it swaps with the color of the square it encompasses. This rule applies until reaching the innermost colored square which swaps its color with the background. So in essence, the transformation is a cyclic rotation of the colors between nearest squares with area in between them.\\\\n52. To make the output, you have to invert the colors of the grid. You replace the green with black, red with green, and black with red.\\\\n53. Each layer of the input grid is replaced by the color of its innermost non-black square (or the square of smallest size). For instance, in Case 1 input, the outermost layer of black (color 0) is replaced by the color 6, the next layer of color 7 is replaced by color 0 (color of its innermost square), and the innermost color 6 remains the same.\\\\n54. To make the output, you have to exchange the colors in the original grid. The outermost square of the input grid takes the color of the inner square from the input grid. The middle square in the input grid takes the color of the outermost square in the original pattern. The innermost square that was a combination of two colors in the input grid takes the color of the secondary color of the middle square in the input grid, and the smaller square within it takes the color of the inner square from the original pattern.\\\\n55. To make the output, invert the colors of the grid. Replace the color of the outer frame with the color of the inner frame and vice versa, the same operation applies to the central square. Black squares from the original grid remain black.\\\\n56. To make the output, you have to swap the outer color with the color of the box. The color in the layer between the outer border and the box remains the same, if there\\'s any color inside the box also remains the same.\\\\n57. To make the output, you have swap the colors of the outer square and the middle square, leaving the second ring (and the replacements in the middle square) the same.\\\\n58. To create the output, reverse the colors present in the input image, keeping the arrangement of the colors the same. For example, if the border color is green, the inner square color is red, and the center color is black in the input, then the output should have a border color of black, an inner border color of green and center color of red. It is a color inversion while retaining pattern.\\\\n59. To construct the output, swap the colors in the input grid. The outermost color in the input becomes the central color in the output and the innermost color of the input becomes the outer frame color in the output. Maintain the black cells in their original location.\\\\n60. To make the output, the color of the smallest non-black box becomes the color of the larger box and the black color becomes the color of the smaller box. The color of the smallest box, whether it is teal or black, becomes the color of the smallest box in the output. In other words, swap the colors of the smallest non-black box and smallest black box and the largest box.\\\\n61. To make the output, you have to switch the colors between the outer boundary and the innermost square. The middle square retains its color. If the innermost square was black in the input, it gets the color of the outer boundary in the output and vice versa.\\\\n62. To make the output, you have to invert the colors in the input grid. All the outer color (identified by the corners of the grid) turns into the central color of the input grid. Then the secondary color of the input (forming the second layer of the pattern) turns into the outer color of the input. Finally, all the blank spaces turn into the secondary color of the input grid.\\\\n\"}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "Category 1: Rules that involve swapping the colors of the outermost and innermost squares, while leaving the middle color unchanged.\n- Rules: 5, 23, 26, 33, 41, 46, 61\n- Synthesized Rule: To create the output, swap the colors of the outermost and innermost squares from the input, while maintaining the color of the middle square.\n\nCategory 2: Rules that involve inverting the colors of the entire grid, with specific replacements for each color.\n- Rules: 4, 20, 29, 50, 52, 55, 58\n- Synthesized Rule: To create the output, invert the colors of the entire input grid, replacing each color with a specific other color.\n\nCategory 3: Rules that involve swapping the colors of the outermost and innermost squares, with specific rules for black squares or cells.\n- Rules: 7, 16, 32, 43, 44, 59\n- Synthesized Rule: To create the output, swap the colors of the outermost and innermost squares from the input, with specific rules for handling black squares or cells.\n\nCategory 4: Rules that involve swapping the colors of the outermost and innermost squares, while maintaining the color of the second outermost square.\n- Rules: 6, 22, 36, 47\n- Synthesized Rule: To create the output, swap the colors of the outermost and innermost squares from the input, while maintaining the color of the second outermost square.\n\nCategory 5: Rules that involve swapping the colors of the outermost and middle squares, while leaving the innermost color unchanged.\n- Rules: 10, 57\n- Synthesized Rule: To create the output, swap the colors of the outermost and middle squares from the input, while maintaining the color of the innermost square.\n\nCategory 6: Rules that involve swapping the colors of the outermost and innermost squares, with specific rules for handling squares of a certain size.\n- Rules: 34, 38, 60\n- Synthesized Rule: To create the output, swap the colors of the outermost and innermost squares from the input, with specific rules for handling squares of a certain size.\n\nCategory 7: Rules that involve swapping the colors of the outermost and innermost squares, while maintaining the color of the second innermost square.\n- Rules: 27, 30, 56\n- Synthesized Rule: To create the output, swap the colors of the outermost and innermost squares from the input, while maintaining the color of the second innermost square.\n\nCategory 8: Rules that involve swapping the colors of the outermost and innermost squares, with specific rules for handling squares of a certain position.\n- Rules: 13, 39, 40, 49\n- Synthesized Rule: To create the output, swap the colors of the outermost and innermost squares from the input, with specific rules for handling squares of a certain position.", "('[{\\'role\\': \\'system\\', \\'content\\': \\'You are an expert natural language parser.

For each category, synthesize the rules into a single, specific rule that combines the ideas of all rules in that category, while clearly differentiating it from the other categories.\\\\nThe new rule should be as specific as possible, following the format of the given rules.\\\\nThe new rule should be applicable without any information from the original rules - i.e. it should be standalone.\\\\n\\\\nRules:\\\\n1. To make the output, keep the border of each shape in grey cells as it is. Change the central black cells inside the top shape into teal cells, and the ones inside the bottom shape into brown cells. If there is a single black cell surrounded by grey cells inside the shape, convert that black cell into a pink cell in the top shape and a fuchsia cell in the bottom shape. Leave the rest of the cells as they are without any changes.\\\\n2. To make the output, you have to change the cells that are inside the \\\\\\'C\\\\\\' figures according to the following rules. If a cell is on the top left of the figure, change it to teal (number 8). If a cell is on the top right, bottom left or bottom right of the figure, change it to magenta (number 6). If a cell is in the middle of the figure, change it to purple (number 7). The cells forming the \\\\\\'C\\\\\\' profile itself and all other cells remain the same.\\\\n3. To make the output, you have to look at the digit \\\\\\'5\\\\\\'. In the mirror reflection, the \\\\\\'5\\\\\\' pattern that does not contain a grey (5) fill should be replaced with red (2) for the bottom part, teal (8) for the middle part, and fuschia (6) for the upper part. This replacement process should repeat for all mirrored \\\\\\'5\\\\\\' figures.\\\\n4. The transformation process is as follows. In the output, if a grey square of the input has a 1x1 hole, the hole is replaced with a teal box (7) surrounded by white (2) boxes that replace the grey ones. If the hole is a 3x3, the hole is replaced by a 2x2 teal (8) square; the grey boxes around it are replaced by two colors, along the diagonal the boxes are replaced by an orange (6) one, the rest are replaced by white (2). The hole\\\\\\'s center is left black.\\\\n5. To transform the input to the output, you must replace the innermost square of the left-hand side grey construction with the color teal (number 8) and the color fuchsia (number 7) for the mirrored, right-hand side construction. In the case of a singular grey square being in the center, color it instead with the color brown (number 6). Everything else remains the same.\\\\n6. To make the output, you have to identify the \"E\" and \"I\" shapes, within each shape an \"I\" of teal should replace the central empty space. If the \"E\" shape has a cell in its central horizontal, that cell changes to fuschia. Also, replace the upper middlemost cell in the \"E\" shape with red.\\\\n7. Now, to transform the input grid to the output grid: Start by locating the grey square shapes on the grid which are always the same size but may be located in different quadrants. For the output grid, every grey cell that is not adjacent to a black cell or the grid border on any side changes to either teal or fuchsia. The choice depends on the quadrant of the original grey square: in the input, for the top-right quadrant, change the inner cells to teal. If the original grey square is in the bottom-left quadrant, change the inner cells to fuchsia. Keep the cells on the border of the square grey. Finally identify one cell in the square (for upper right it is the second along and down, for lower left it is the second from right and top) and change its color to fuchsia (for upper right) or blue (for lower left).\\\\n8. To transform the input into the output, you color the squares of the \\\\\\'0\\\\\\' and \\\\\\'8\\\\\\' figures according to specific rules. The \\\\\\'0\\\\\\' figure is divided into two areas: inner area (contains white squares) and outer area (the rest of the \\\\\\'0\\\\\\' figure). You keep the outer area gray, but change the color of the inner area to a teal color. For the \\\\\\'8\\\\\\' figure, you divide it into three areas: top, middle, and bottom areas. You keep the squares in the top and bottom areas gray, but change the color of the middle area to orange. Further, you find the center square of the \\\\\\'0\\\\\\' and \\\\\\'8\\\\\\' figures, which is in gray in the input, and change its color to fuschia in the output.\\\\n9. To create the output grid, identify the 2 grey squares separated by three rows of black cells. In each of these squares, change the colour of all interior cells except one in the middle of the smaller square on the right half of the grey square. In the first case, the changed cells turn teal besides ones in the center which turns fuschia and in the second case, it turns teal besides ones in the center which turns orange.\\\\n10. To make the output, transform the inner part of the grey squares. In the first square, replace the top row of the inner part with teal, replace the center squares of the second and third rows with fuschia, and leave the bottom row as it is. The second square\\\\\\'s transformation is the same, but the inner part becomes all orange instead. Leave the black background and outside of the grey squares unchanged.\\\\n11. To make the output, you have to take the internal square of each grey square and change its color. If the grey square was found to the left in the input, change the internal square\\\\\\'s color to teal in the output. Alternatively, if the grey square was found to the right in the input, change the internal square\\\\\\'s color to orange in the output.  Additionally, if there is a grey pixel surrounded by grey pixels in a 3x3 square in the input and it is not part of the internal 3x3 square grid, color it fuchsia in the output.\\\\n12. To make the output, you have replace the inner cells of the top shape with teal (represented by 8), resulting in a teal square with grey borders. In the bottom shape\\\\\\'s black inner cells, you have to replace them with orange (represented by 7), again leading to an orange square with grey borders. Keep the black cells that form the ground and the outermost cells of the shapes unchanged.\\\\n13. To make the output, you have to replace the central cell of each grey square shape. If the grey square shape is oriented to the right, replace the central cell with a yellow cell. If the grey square shape is oriented to the left, fill the central cells with a teal cell. For the grey square that has no clear orientation, replace the central cell with a fuschia cell. The rest remains unchanged.\\\\n14. To produce the output grid, the grey cells between two black cells are colored teal, and one grey cell that is placed between black cells diagonally is colored fuschia. If the grey cell is the only one between any black cells (no black cells around it horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), it is colored red. This changes depend on the shape and placement of the grey cells in the input grid. The black cells in the input grid, which stand for emptiness or the background, remain unaltered.\\\\n15. To make the output, you have to change the color of the cells inside of each square: - Cells that are in the 1st image from the top left corner, should be filled with teal. - Cells that are in the 1st image from the top right corner, should be filled with teal. - Cells that are in the 2nd image from the bottom left corner, should be filled with orange. - Cells that are in the 2nd image from the bottom right corner, should be filled with orange. - If a cell is in the center of a square, color it in fuschia. - The rest of the grid remains the same.\\\\n16. To transform the input into the output, retain the outer layer of each letter figure with the current color, grey. Then color the interior of the top letter figure with teal, whereas, color the middle part of the bottom letter figure with orange. Then find the center of each letter and color it with a different color: top letter figure - fuschia, bottom letter figure - blue. This transforms the solid grey letters into outlined figures with colored details.\\\\n17. To produce the output grid, the pattern swaps the upper inner rectangle box to the number 8 (teal squares) and lower inner rectangle box to the number 7 (orange squares). Also, the upper and lower middle squares of the two outer rectangles, if available, are changed to the number 6 (fuchsia squares).\\\\n18. To make the output, you have to look at the shape which appears second in the input grid. In case where the cell inside the shape (not the boundary) is black, replace it with teal (8) for the first shape in the grid and substitute it with orange (7) for the second shape. For a cell covered by boundary line of the shape change its color to purple (6) in the output grid. Keep all other cells as they are.\\\\n19. The transformation from the input to the output grid involves three steps. First, if the larger square is at the upper half (above the empty row), color the smaller square inside to teal (8). If the larger square is at the lower half (below the empty row), color the smaller square inside to orange (7). Secondly, in both larger squares, change the color of the smaller square that is 2x2 and located at the center to red (6). Lastly, the rest remains the same.\\\\n20. To transform the grid from input to output, observe the two digitized \\\\\\'E\\\\\\' characters formed by grey blocks (represented by the number 5) in the input. For each \\\\\\'E\\\\\\', change the block color of the middle bar from grey (5) to teal (8), and for the bottom bar of the \\\\\\'E\\\\\\' change the block color from grey (5) to red (7). If the grey block represents the \"eye\" or center of the \\\\\\'E\\\\\\', replace it with a hexa block (6). Leave the top bar unchanged. The transformed \\\\\\'E\\\\\\' will still retain its original shape but will have different colors for the bars and the eye.\\\\n21. To make the output, you need to look at the inner area of the gray rectangles in the input. If the rectangle contains a smaller gray square within its four corners, change the color of that inner square: switch the colors according to the following pattern: if the square is in the top rectangle change it to teal, if it is in the bottom rectangle to fuchsia. For any gray square touching the outer edge of the bigger rectangle (whether it belongs to the border or it is on the corner of the inner square), switch its color to orange if it only touches two sides, but keep it gray if it touches three sides.\\\\n22. To make the output, you have to identify these individual sections of squares or rectangles that are enclosed by the grey (5) color. After that, apply the following transformations: - For any square that has 1 black square at the center will have green (8) color fill. So replace grey squares at the center with green (8). - For any square that has 4 black squares at the center will have teal (7) color fill. So replace the four grey squares at the center with teal (7). - Apart from this, any grey square bordering a black square in its respective enclosed section will be replaced by a green square (6). However, do not apply this change to the grey square which is bordering the grey square that is replaced by the green square (8) or the teal square (7).\\\\n23. To make the output, you have to add color to the surrounding 8-connected region of the empty (black) center point inside the rectangular shape. If the rectangle is located on the upper half of the grid, you paint this region teal. And if the rectangle is located on the lower half of the grid, you paint this region orange. A single grey pixel box located at the center of each rectangle should be painted with fuschia.\\\\n24. To make the output, you have to replace the grey boxes in the upper shape with yellow boxes and the black boxes located in the center of it with orange boxes. For the lower shape, you need to replace the grey boxes with green boxes and the black boxes located in the center of it with red boxes. If the black square in both shapes is not in the center but on the edge, replace it with a blue box. All other cells should remain unchanged.\\\\n25. To make the output, two colors are filled inside the grey arrows. The arrow on the left side of the grid is filled with teal(8), the cell that is the tip of the arrow on the left is turned into brown(6). The arrow on the right side of the grid is filled with orange(7). The shape and direction of the original arrows are maintained. The rest of the input matrix is directly copied to the output matrix.\\\\n26. To make the output, focus on the rectangles made of 5s in the input. For the rectangle at the top, change the central square to 6 and those surrounding it to 8, leaving the periphery as 5. For the rectangle at the bottom, change the central square to 7 and those surrounding it to 8, leaving the periphery as 5. Leave all other elements as they are. Transformations are symmetrical across the line of 0s which are the mid-line of the rectangles.\\\\n27. The two 5x5 grey squares in the input need to be transformed in the output in the following way:   1. For the top left corner of each of the two original grey squares, if the cell inside that corner is grey, it becomes teal in the output. If it\\\\\\'s black, it stays black.  2. For the top right corner of each of the original grey squares, if the grey border extends below it (creating a \\\\\\'6\\\\\\' shape), it becomes fuschia in the output. If it doesn\\\\\\'t extend (creating a \\\\\\'7\\\\\\' shape), it stays grey.  3. If a cell is not part of these corner transformations, it stays the same color as it was in the input.\\\\n28. To make the output, you have to follow these steps:   1. Leave the outer border of the squares as it is. 2. Change the color of the inner cells from every grey square to teal (8). 3. Change the color of the inner cells from every second noun-grey square (reading from top to bottom & left to right) to red (7). 4. Lastly, change the center cell of each square. If the center cell is within the squares that were changed to teal, change it to fuchsia (6). For the squares that were changed to red, leave the center as it is.\\\\n29. To make the output, you have to check for the grey (5) cells in the input grid. If a grey cell is surrounded by black cells, replace it with fuschia (6). If a grey cell has other grey cells to its left and right only, replace it with teal (8). If a grey cell has other grey cells above and below it only, replace it with orange (7). Leave the rest of the grid, including the original black background, as it is.\\\\n30. To make the output, you have to fill in the hollow centers of each square with a distinct color depending on their position. The upper square should be filled with teal-colored (8) cells, while the lower square is filled with orange-colored (7) cells.   Additionally, for every square, the cell in the center row which is bounded by grey-colored cells on two sides should be of a distinct color. In the upper square, it should be green (6), and in the lower square, it should be blue (1).\\\\n31. To transform the grid into the output, we need to change the color of those black cells within the top grey square to teal and the black cells within the bottom grey square to orange. An additional change is in the center most grey cell of the top square that will change to deep pink and the center most grey cell of the bottom square will change to dark red.\\\\n32. To make the output, you have to color the black squares nested inside the gray squares. The coloring process should be done based on their position. If the black square is towards the right of the grid, it should be painted teal. If it has a black cell in the center, turn the central cell fuschia. For the gray square located on the left, color the nested black square with red. If it also has a black cell in the center, turn the central cell mustard. The rest of the cells which are in gray should remain gray as in the input grid.\\\\n33. 1. Change the number in the center of the top blue 5x5 grid to yellow (6) and change the rest of the inner blue cells of the grid to teal (8).     2. Change the number in the center of the bottom blue 5x5 grid to green (7) and change the rest of the inner blue cells of the grid to teal (8).     So the output is the transformation of the inner blue cells of the original 5x5 grid while keeping the periphery and the buffer black space as they are. The changed blue cells in the top and bottom grid are also different upon transformation.\\\\n34. The transformation rule appears to apply to sections of 5x5 squares in the input grid. Transform the 5x5 grid of \\\\\\'5\\\\\\'s such that the area inside the \\\\\\'5\\\\\\' border (a 3x3 grid in the middle of the bigger 5x5 square) is filled in with a different number: \\\\\\'8\\\\\\' or \\\\\\'7\\\\\\'. Leave the rest of the grid unchanged.  There\\\\\\'s also a unique transformation for each kind of 5x5 square found in the input grid: - If the cells in the first column of the 3x3 grid are filled with \\\\\\'5\\\\\\', fill the 3x3 grid with \\\\\\'7\\\\\\'. - If the cells in the second row of the 3x3 grid are filled with \\\\\\'5\\\\\\', fill the 3x3 grid with \\\\\\'8\\\\\\'. - In both cases, any \\\\\\'5\\\\\\'s in the four corners of the 3x3 grid should be transformed to \\\\\\'6\\\\\\'\\\\n35. To transform the input to its corresponding output, identify the cells (represented by \\\\\\'0\\\\\\') that are surrounded by grey cells horizontally and vertically. Fill these identified cells with the color teal (\\\\\\'8\\\\\\'). Then, find those cells that only have grey cells either horizontally or vertically, but not both, and fill these cells with orange (\\\\\\'7\\\\\\'). In the centre of the drawn shapes, where you find a grey cell (\\\\\\'5\\\\\\') surrounded only by zeroes, change this particular cell to purple (\\\\\\'6\\\\\\'). The rest of the grid cells remain the same.\\\\n36. Transform the grid as follows: 1. If there is a grey (5) block in the input grid, and it is surrounded on all four sides (vertically & horizontally not diagonally) by other grey blocks, change it to a purple (6) block in the output grid. 2. If there is a grey (5) block in the input grid, and it is surrounded on three sides by other grey blocks, change it to an orange (7) block. 3. If there is a grey (5) block in the input grid, and it is surrounded on two sides by other grey blocks, change it to a teal (8) block.\\\\n37. To make the output, you have to change the color of the black square, nested inside the gray band, according to its position. If the black square is in the top gray band, it should be changed to teal color, with the central cell filled with a magenta color. If the black square is located in the bottom gray band, it should be turned into an orange color.\\\\n38. To make the output, you have to change the internal pixels of the grey squares. For the top right square, if the pixel at (i,j) in the grey square is grey and there are grey pixels both above and below it (i-1,j and i+1,j are also grey), change it to teal. If there\\\\\\'s also a grey pixel to the left, change it to purple instead. For the bottom left square, do the same, but change suitable pixels to orange, and if there\\\\\\'s also a grey pixel to the right, keep them as grey.\\\\n39. To make the output, you have to replace the cell in the middle of each grey rectangle with purple cell (represented by number 6) if it is in the intersection point of the \\\\\\'T\\\\\\' and \\\\\\'I\\\\\\'. Replace the remaining interior cells of each rectangle (excluding the middle cell and the boundary) according to the following fashion: if the rectangle is oriented horizontally, replace with aqua (represented by number 8); if it is vertical, replace with orange (represented by number 7). The remaining cells stay the same as in the input grid.\\\\n40. To transform the input grid into the output grid, first identify the two separate grey patterns in the input grid. Transform the top pattern such that the inner box becomes teal, and replace the single cell at the center with fuchsia. For the bottom pattern, turn the inner box into orange. Keep all the other cells, including black ones and the borders of the patterns, unchanged.\\\\n41. To make the output, you have to fill the spaces inside the \\\\\\'C\\\\\\' shapes. For the upper \\\\\\'C\\\\\\', fill the inside space with teal boxes. Add a single cyan box in the middle row and middle column of the grey \\\\\\'C\\\\\\' shape. For the lower \\\\\\'C\\\\\\', fill the inside space with orange boxes. All other cells remain the same as in the input grid.\\\\n42. To make the output:  - Apply a rule to any 3x3 segment within the 5x5 squares that contains 5 in each corner and 0s in the middle. You modify these inner squares by replacing 5s with 8s in the top square and 7s in the bottom square.  - If there is a 5 at the center of the 3x3 segment, replace it with a 6. This results in hollow squares with slightly smaller squares inside them, the centers of which contain a different color if the original number was present.\\\\n43. To make the output, focus on the gray patterns in the input. If a letter is closed on all four sides by gray boxes (forming a square), replace the inner spaces of the gray pattern with (8). If the gray pattern forms a hollow line (like an alphabet looking to the left or to the right), fill the inside of the gray pattern with (7). If the gray pattern forms a hollow rectangle (looks like the shape of a tea cup), fill the inside of the gray pattern with (6). Keep the rest of the grid just as the same.\\\\n44. To achieve the output from the input, the center cell of the upper square becomes red (6) and the unborded cells of the square are turned fuchsia (8), while the center cells of the lower square are turned orange (7) and the unborded cells of the square are turned teal (8). The rest of the cells remain unchanged.\\\\n45. To make the output, you have to pick the top right box of each grey square and change to the color representing number 6. Then select all interior boxes of each grey square except the top right box, and change their color to the color representing number 8 at the top half of the grid and number 7 at the bottom half of the grid. Other parts remain the same as in the input.\\\\n46. To make the output, you have to focus on the grey rectangles. In each rectangle, if any of the empty black squares is surrounded on its four sides (up, down, left, and right) by grey squares, fill that square with teal color. For the rectangle on top, if the black square has a grey square at its top side, fill the square with purple. For the rectangle at the bottom, if the black square has a grey square at the bottom side, fill that square with orange.\\\\n47. The transformation involves changing specific cells in each gray block.  - Gray block (4 x 6 cells) at the top left of the grid: When trying to transform this block into the output grid, leave the border and the cells diagonally adjacent to the corners as gray. Change the center cell to brown (6) and the rest of the cells to teal (8). - Gray block (4 x 4 cells) at the bottom right of the grid: Similar to the previous step, leave the border, and the cells diagonally adjacent to the corners as gray. However, change the rest of the cells to fuschia (7).\\\\n48. To make the output, follow these steps: 01. The topmost square is transformed first. Replace the innermost layer of this square which is only a single cell, color it fuschia (06). 02. Replace the second layer which is an empty square of four cells, color it teal (08). 03. The third layer which completes the top square remains the same. 04. The bottom square is transformed similarly with the difference: for the second layer composed of empty square of four cells, color it orange (07). 05. The external layer of the bottom square remains the same. 06. The rest of the grid with black cells remain unchanged.\\\\n49. To make the output, you have to keep the outer border of the letter-like figures the same, but fill in the interior. The interior cells, which were formerly black, become teal in the right-side figure and become pink in the left-side figure. If there are grey cells in the center of the figure, they turn brown.\\\\n50. To make the output, you have to keep the grey \"letters\" filled in the same way as in the input, but for the inner cells of the grey letters (the non-contour cells within the letter shapes), change their color. If all four sides of an inner cell are surrounded by grey cells, change the color of the inner cell to teal (8). If the inner cell is located diagonally to a grey cell at its corner, change the cell color to fuchsia (6). Else, change the color to orange (7).\\\\n51. To make the output, you have to replace the second row from top and second row from bottom inside each area of grey colored cells with red color. The cell which is second from top and third from left or right inside each area of grey colored cells should be replaced with teal color. The cell which is fourth from top and third from left or right inside each area of grey colored cells should be replaced with fuschia color. The rest remains the same as in the input grid.\\\\n52. To make the output, you have to replace some of the gray rectangles. The leftmost empty space within the rectangle will be filled with teal, the rightmost empty space will be filled with orange, any space that is not leftmost or rightmost within the rectangle will be filled with fuchsia, and remaining empty spaces outside the rectangles are unchanged.\\\\n53. To make the output, you have to: Step 1: Leave the top and bottom horizontal lines of each square along with the vertical lines on the left and right ends of each square as they are. Step 2: Color the center block of the four squares with different colors. The top left square is colored orange, the top right square purple, the bottom left square with light blue and the bottom right with brown. Step 3: Fill the remaining part of the four squares with dark green.\\\\n54. To make the output, you have to keep the original shapes but change the color of the interior of the shapes. The color mapping for the interior is: - First shape (top half): gray to teal - Second shape (bottom half): gray to orange  Special conditions: The cell in the center of the shapes (if exist) should be changed to a different color as follows: - First shape (top half): gray to red - Second shape (bottom half): gray to purple Other cells on the grid remain the same color.\\\\n55. Top half of the grid focuses on the vertical component and the bottom half focuses on the horizontal component of the plus. Each interior, non-line part of the plus sign is replaced according to the following rules:   - For the top half, if the column index is even, the cell becomes teal (represented by number 6); if the column index is odd, the cell becomes orange (represented by number 8).  - For the bottom half, if the row index is even, the cell becomes orange (represented by number 8); if the row index is odd, the cell becomes red (represented by number 7).   A cell is considered part of an interior if it is bordered by two grey cells along the axis of symmetry and on the both side of that axis.\\\\n56. For each gray square in the input grid, identify the central black square within it. In the output, the top-left corner will remain gray (5), the top-right corner will change to teal (8), the bottom-left corner changes to orange (6), and the bottom-right corner changes to purple (7). The colors are assigned in this order. If a corner doesn\\\\\\'t have enough cells (for example, in case 0, the bottom left corner of the right square only has one cell), fill it entirely with the assigned corner color. The rest of the cells in the output grid should remain the same as in the input.\\\\n57. To make the output, start with the input grid. For the circular shape on top, find the middle cell within the shape\\\\\\'s top and bottom boundaries (not counting the border) and assign it a fuschia color. As for the angular shape at the bottom, find the cells that are within the shape, except for its borders, and assign them an teal color. For both shapes, if there\\\\\\'s more than one middle cell, choose the cell on the left. Lastly, identify the cells extended from the center of the shapes to the side, aligned horizontally in prospective to the center cell. Start from the center cell and move to the outer cells. Change those cells\u2019 colors to brown, and you have the output grid.\\\\n58. You need to fill in the internals of both grey shapes. Firstly, the 4x4 square on the top-right quadrant should have the internal grey cells replaced with teal cells, leaving a single cell at (3, 8) (from top-left) unchanged. This cell should be changed to fuchsia if the shape is rotated left 90 degrees. Secondly, the U-shape object at the bottom-center the grid should have internal blocks filled with teal except for a single cell at the hinge (center) of U, which is colored fuchsia. If the U-shaped figure is rotated left 90 degrees, find the cell at (9, 4) and color it fuchsia.\\\\n59. To create the output, you should follow these steps:  1. Identify the separate colored boxes in the input grid. 2. For the box in the top left, replace the internal cells with another color, but leave the cells that contain the same colored boxes in the input grid unchanged except for one single colored cell placed at the third row, fourth column starting from the top left cell of each box, which is changed to a unique color. 3. For the box in the bottom right, replace the internal cells with another color, but leave the cells that contain the same colored boxes in the input grid unchanged. 4. Keep the black cells unchanged.\\\\n60. To make the output, you have to change the squares inside the border square of the bottom grey square in the input to teal. If there is a single black square inside the top grey square in the input, the cell of the output corresponding to the center of this grey square should be marked as fuchsia. If there is no single black square inside the grey top square in the input, leave the cells inside the gray square of the output as black. The cells around these two square formations stay black.\\\\n61. To make the output, you should transform the filled cells in the shape according to their position. For the top shape, transform the cell that is second from the left (X positioned) by changing it from grey to teal. For the cell that is second from the right (X positioned), change it from grey to orange. And for the cell that is in the middle of the shape, change it from grey to pink. In the lower shape, transform the cell that is second from the left (X positioned) by changing it from grey to teal and for the cell that is second from the right (X positioned), change it from grey to teal. As for the cells outside the shape, no changes are made.\\\\n62. To make the output, you have to replace all the inner black cells of the grey squares with the colors teal and orange respectively. Meanwhile, there are some grey cells inside the grey square that are replaced with fuchsia.\\\\n63. Find each grey square and find the center cell(s) for each of them. If the row of the center cell is even, you change the color of the cells that were originally grey to color 8 (teal) except that you keep the color of the center cell as color 6 (fuchsia) ; if the row of the center cell is odd, you change the color of the cells that were originally grey to color 7 (orange). Please note that the center cell(s) is(are) the cell(s) equally distant from all sides of the square.\\\\n64. To transform the grid, you have to make the following changes:   1. For the top grey square, replace the inner black (hollow part) with teal color. Now if the top left cell of the inner 3x3 square is black in the input, change it to rare pink.       2. For the downwards grey square, replace the inner black (hollow part) with orange color. If the top left cell of the inner 3x3 square is black, then do not make any change. Otherwise, change it to rare pink as well.   Remember that all the color changes are to be done only for the inner 3x3 squares of the grey squares.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 906}\")": "After analyzing the rules, they can be categorized into eight distinct categories based on their similarities:\n\nCategory 1: Rules involving color changes based on the position of cells within shapes or figures.\nCategory 2: Rules involving color changes based on the orientation or direction of shapes or figures.\nCategory 3: Rules involving color changes based on the surrounding cells of a particular cell.\nCategory 4: Rules involving color changes based on the quadrant or location of shapes or figures in the grid.\nCategory 5: Rules involving color changes based on the presence of specific cells or patterns within shapes or figures.\nCategory 6: Rules involving color changes based on the size or dimensions of shapes or figures.\nCategory 7: Rules involving color changes based on the symmetry or asymmetry of shapes or figures.\nCategory 8: Rules involving color changes based on the specific characteristics of shapes or figures (e.g., letters, numbers, etc.).\n\nSynthesized Rules:\n\n1.

For each category, synthesize the rules into a single, specific rule that combines the ideas of all rules in that category, while clearly differentiating it from the other categories.\\\\nThe new rule should be as specific as possible, following the format of the given rules.\\\\nThe new rule should be applicable without any information from the original rules - i.e. it should be standalone.\\\\n\\\\nRules:\\\\n1. To form the output from the input, take the top half (excluding the middle yellow line) and mirror it downward, keeping the yellow line as the axis of reflection. The top and bottom halves of the output should be exactly the same.\\\\n2. To make the output, take all the colored figures above the yellow line and mirror them below the yellow line. The yellow line stays the same. The elements below the yellow line in the input grid is not considered in the output grid. If there were any other colors in the original below-half grid, they are ignored and the mirrored figures take their place.\\\\n3. To form the output grid, the coloured patterns above the yellow strip are copied below the yellow strip. The placement of these patterns below is identical to their placement above. The remaining cells not filled with these patterns remain black.\\\\n4. To transform the grid, you should mirror the top section of the input grid just below the yellow line into the bottom section of the output grid, essentially creating a reflection of the top section along the central horizontal axis, the yellow line.\\\\n5. To make the output, copy the upper half of the input above the yellow line, including the yellow line itself, and then paste it onto the lower half that is below the yellow line.\\\\n6. The pattern between the input grid and the output grid is a mirror effect. The part above the yellow line is mirrored exactly below the yellow line. You basically take the colored cells above the yellow line and copy them below the line, maintaining their relative positioning. Black cells replace any other cell that is not part of the mirrored pattern. The yellow line remains untouched.\\\\n7. To transform the grid into the output, mirror the top half of the grid below the yellow line, over the bottom half. The yellow line remains unchanged.\\\\n8. To make the output, you have to mirror the upper section below the yellow line. Any colors or patterns in the upper section get mirrored in the lower section, with the yellow line acting as the mirror line.\\\\n9. To make the output, you have to mirror the pattern above the yellow line to the black part below it. The yellow line acts as the axis of mirror. Only the things above the line are mirrored, and things on the line remain the same.\\\\n10. To produce the output from the input, replicate the patterns of colours found in the first half of the grid (above the yellow line) into the second half of the grid (below the yellow line) in the exact positions. The yellow line should remain as it is.\\\\n11. To make the output, you have to mirror the cells above the yellow line below the yellow line, preserving the color and position relative to the yellow line. The mirrored cells should overwrite any cells that were previously in the mirrored position.\\\\n12. To make the output, reflect the portion of the grid above the yellow line, vertically downwards to fill the empty space below the yellow line. The yellow line remains central and unchanged.\\\\n13. The transformation involves replicating the pattern above the yellow line below the line, in the same position and orientation. If there is another color present under the yellow line, it should be replaced by the color from the pattern above the line. Any black squares below the yellow line that don\\\\\\'t correspond to a colored square above the line should stay black.\\\\n14. To transform the input grid to the output grid, you should mirror the upper half of the grid below the yellow line. After the transformation, if a pixel is colored in the grid above the yellow line, there will be a pixel in the same column with the same color in the corresponding position in the lower half of the grid.\\\\n15. To make the output, you have to take the top half of the grid and mirror it below the yellow line. This creates a symmetry in the grid with the yellow line as the symmetry line. The upper and lower part of the grid on both side of the yellow line are the same.\\\\n16. The top and bottom sections of the grid mirror each other, the output is created by keeping the yellow line central, and copying the pattern of colored (numbered) cells from the upper section onto the lower section. The colored cells in the lower section of the input grid are ignored and overwritten.\\\\n17. To make the output, you have to mirror the top part of the grid below the yellow line. Everything below the yellow line in the input should be discarded, and instead, a mirrored copy of everything above the yellow line should fill the second half of the grid. The yellow line should remain in the same place.\\\\n18. To make the output, you have to keep the yellow line as it is. Then mirror the cells above the yellow line to the cells below the yellow line. For this you need to copy in reverse the different colors of the smaller square grids above the yellow line to the smaller squares grids below the yellow line.\\\\n19. The output can be generated by copying the pattern of colored points in the top section of the grid (above the yellow line) and pasting it on the corresponding cells of the bottom section of the grid (below the yellow line). The yellow line remains where it originally is, dividing the two mirrored patterns.\\\\n20. To make the output, you have to mirror the colored polygons above the yellow line and place them below the line maintaining the same horizontal position. The yellow line remains in the same position.\\\\n21. For transformation, mirror the shapes in the top half over the yellow line to the bottom half, i.e place the shapes exactly where they would have been if the yellow line was a mirror. It\\\\\\'s a reflection around the horizontal axis defined by the yellow line. The color and position of shapes must remain the same. The shapes in the upper half should remain intact.\\\\n22. To make the output, you have to copy the cells above the yellow line to the cells below the yellow line, mirroring the upper grid along the horizontal yellow line.\\\\n23. To make the output, you have to mirror/reflect the top half of the grid (above the yellow line) below the yellow line. The bottom half below the yellow line in the output should look exactly like the mirror image of the top half of the grid.\\\\n24. To make the output, you have to mirror the top part of the grid to the bottom part across the middle horizontal yellow line. The figures( color-filled cells) found above the yellow line should be replicated below the yellow line in the same columns.\\\\n25. To get the output from the input, first, copy the entire input as it is to the output. Now, for the transformation, mirror the top section of the grid (excluding the yellow line) about the yellow line such that it overlaps the bottom section in the output. The colors of the cells should be preserved in this mirror operation.  In simple terms, the colored pattern above the yellow line is mirrored below the line in the output.\\\\n26. To make the output, reflect each colored cell above the yellow line to its mirror position below the yellow line. So if there\\\\\\'s a colored cell at a row i above the yellow line, the same color will be put on the complementary row i counted from the bottom up under the yellow line. Leave the yellow line and the rest of the cells black.\\\\n27. To make the output, you have to reflect the colors in the top grid in the empty cells below the yellow line. The black cells remain black. The yellow line remains intact. The transformation can be phrased as \"Copy the pattern above the yellow line and place it below the yellow line\".\\\\n28. To transform the input into the output, mirror the upper half of the grid (above the yellow line) onto the lower half of the grid (below the yellow line). Maintain the yellow line separating both halves. However, any objects that land on the yellow line after mirroring should be overlapped by the yellow line. The rest of the layout and the objects and their position in the top half of the output grid should remain the same as it was in the input grid.  The output grid should look like a reflection of the top half reflected across the yellow line with the rest of the grid filled with black cells (empty space).\\\\n29. To make the output, you have to mirror the number locations from the top half of the grid onto the bottom half. This means the numbers and their placing in relation to the yellow line in the top half should be reflected into the bottom half around the yellow line.\\\\n30. To produce the output grid you need to reflect the top half of the grid (above the yellow line) onto the bottom half (below the yellow line). Do not alter the yellow row at all. Empty cells in the top half (values of 0) should also be copied to the bottom half. The bottom half of the input should be discarded.\\\\n31. To form the output, the pattern is mirrored along the yellow stripe. Take the upper half of the grid above the yellow line (not including the yellow line) and mirror it below the yellow line, maintaining the same sequence. Similarly, the lower half below the yellow line is mirrored to the top half as well. The yellow line remains the same.\\\\n32. To make the output, you have to copy the entire specified colored pattern of the upper half of the grid and paste it to the lower half, right below the yellow line. The copied pattern should match the original one, regardless of the numbers/colors it contains. Everything else in the output should be the same as in the input, including the position of the yellow line.\\\\n33. To achieve the output grid, one should mirror the configuration of colors in the top half to the bottom half. This includes the black cells as well. The yellow line in the middle should be retained as is. The bottom half, be it filled or empty should be replaced by the configuration of the top half.\\\\n34. To make the output, you have to replicate the pattern of colored cells above the yellow line to the area below the yellow line, so that the grid becomes symmetric along the yellow line. The yellow line remains unchanged.\\\\n35. To transform the grid, retain the yellow line and the boxes on the left side of the line. Above the line, copy the colored boxes from the left side to the right side, mirroring them about the yellow line. Below the line, do the same thing but preserve the black boxes.\\\\n36. To generate the output, you have to take the cells above the yellow line and mirror them below the yellow line. Ignore any cells that are below of the yellow line in the input grid.\\\\n37. To make the output, you have to mirror the top part of the grid that is above the yellow line, to the bottom part of the grid that is below the yellow line. The positions of colored cells in relation to the yellow line are kept equal while duplicating them below the line.\\\\n38. To make the output, you have to reflect the above part (above the yellow line) to the bottom part (below the yellow line). The Yellow line remains the same. Colored dots in bottom part should be replaced by reflection of the top part (mirrored vertical reflection).\\\\n39. To make the output, you are to reflect the top area of the grid, from the yellow line upwards, onto the bottom area. This means the area beneath the yellow line should be an identical copy of the area above the yellow line, effectively duplicating the top half of the grid into the bottom half.\\\\n40. To transform the input into the output, the pattern in the area above the yellow line is replicated to the area below the yellow line. Basically, it\\\\\\'s a mirror reflection across the yellow line.\\\\n41. To make the output, you should flip the grid around the yellow line. Transpose the pattern of color squares above the yellow line to below it. The pattern of squares below the yellow line should be exactly the same as the pattern was above the line. The rest of the grid remains black.\\\\n42. To make the output, note that the bottom half of the grid below the blue line is entirely black cells. Transfer the pattern from the upper half of the grid (above the blue line) to the lower half, while keeping the blue line and the upper half unchanged. Hence, the grid is mirrored along the blue line.\\\\n43. The output is created by mirroring the top part of the grid about the yellow line into the black part of the grid. So, the bottom part of output grid is a mirror reflection of top part.\\\\n44. To make the output, you need to reflect the colored dots from the top half to the lower half. The line of yellow represents the \\\\\\'mirror\\\\\\' for reflection. Completely black rows remain black in the output.\\\\n45. To make the output, you have to mirror the configuration of dots (including their color) from the top section to the bottom section (below the yellow line), ensuring that the yellow line remains at the center horizontally. This mirrored configuration should be identical to the original configuration in the top section, including the positions of colored dots.\\\\n46. To make the output, flip the content above the yellow line vertically, and fill the lower part in the output grid with this mirrored content, while keeping the yellow line and the upper part of the grid intact.\\\\n47. To make the output, you have to mirror the top half of the grid to the bottom half of the grid. The center yellow row separates the top and bottom halves and remains unchanged.\\\\n48. To transform the grid and create the output, everything above the horizontal line of yellow squares is mirrored to everything below this line. Any colored square has its position mirrored on the opposite side of the yellow line. The yellow lines remain unchanged.\\\\n49. The initial part of the transformation, which includes a yellow horizontal line in the middle of the grid, is not modified. The colored elements above this line are mirrored below it to replace the black cells, symmetrically with respect to the yellow line. The elements keep their relative positions, colors and are also rotated around their own center.\\\\n50. To make the output, you have to mirror everything from above the yellow line to below the yellow line, maintaining the yellow line at the center. If a square does not have a mirror below the yellow line, it stays black.\\\\n51. To make the output, you have to reflect the grid over the horizontal yellow line - everything that is above the line should be copied below and vice versa. The yellow line itself stays the same.\\\\n52. To make the output, you have to mirror the top half of the grid onto the bottom half, keeping the yellow line in the middle. The colors and positions of the cells in the top half should be replicated in the same location in the bottom half, maintaining their horizontal position but mirrored vertically around the yellow line. The yellow line should not change.\\\\n53. To make the output, you have to reflect the top cells onto the bottom cells while maintaining their horizontal positioning. The yellow division line remains unchanged in the process. So, any colored pattern that is above the yellow line should be mirrored below the line. This should be done while keeping black cells (if they exist) as they are.\\\\n54. To make the output, you have to take the cells above the yellow line and mirror them onto the cells below the line (the yellow line is the axis of symmetry). The cells below the yellow line then take on the value of the corresponding cell from above the yellow line.  The yellow line itself remains unchanged.\\\\n55. The colored cells above the yellow line must be mirrored below the yellow line. The transformation consists of mirroring or copying the placement of colored cells from above the yellow line to below it.\\\\n56. To make the output, take the first part of the input grid, copy, flip it vertically and replace the second part of the grid with this new grid. In other words, reflect the upper half of the grid below the yellow line.\\\\n57. To to obtain the output grid from the input grid, first, divide the grid into two equal parts, separated by a line of yellow cells in the middle. Then, mirror the colored cells in the top section on the bottom section directly below the yellow line and vice versa. The positions of the colored cells in the top section should be reflected in the bottom section, and the colored cells in the bottom section should be reflected in the top section. The mirrored cells should replace any existing cells in those positions.\\\\n58. To achieve the output from the input, the transformation involves flipping the design above the yellow line and copying it without any modifications directly under the yellow line. The result is each individual sample (excluding the yellow line) is mirrored along the horizontal axis of the entire grid.\\\\n59. To transform the grid, the arrangement and coloration above the yellow line (4) is duplicated from below the yellow line (4). This means that the shapes and their relative positions are mirrored vertically across the yellow separating line. The line itself remains intact at the center of the grid.\\\\n60. To make the output, you have to mirror the cells above the yellow line below it. Therefore, the cells below the yellow line in the output will have the same pattern as those above the yellow line in the input, and the line itself remains unchanged.\\\\n61. The transformation involves mirroring the upper half part of the grid below the yellow line. The bottom half takes the exact mirror image of the upper half while keeping all the rest cells black.\\\\n62. To make the output, you have to duplicate the part of the grid above the yellow line to the bottom part, replacing whatever was previously there. The yellow line (represented by number 4) remains in the same place dividing the two duplicated parts.\\\\n63. The transformation involves taking the upper half up to the yellow line, excluding the line itself, and mirroring it onto the lower half (below the yellow line). Any colors and their placement in the upper half should be mirrored in the lower half. If a box in the lower half already has a color, the mirror from the upper half should overwrite it. The yellow line remains unchanged.\\\\n64. To make the output, you have to duplicate the area above the yellow stripe and place it below the stripe. The area below the yellow stripe from the input is not included in the output. So essentially, the upper half of the grid is mirrored.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "After analyzing the rules, it appears that they all fall into a single category.

To make the output, you have to scale down the input grid into a smaller grid. This is done by taking every other row and column starting from the third row and third column. In other words, you skip the first 2 rows/columns and then take 1 row/column and skip next 1, repeating this process until to the end.\\\\n2. To make the output, you have to divide the input grid into equally smaller squares, each one maintaining the colors and patterns of the larger grid with the central color being the most prevalent color in that square in the larger grid. The colors on the edges should correspond to the color of the dots in the larger grid with the center continuing to be the most popular color in the center of the larger grid.\\\\n3. To make the output, you have to take the middle cells (colored or not) of the two horizontal and vertical lines and place them in the same position in the output. Any other color in the array is converted to the major color in the array. The extra color will occupy two cells of one of the diagonal lines within the output array.\\\\n4. To make the output, you need to first identify the cells of any color other than green in the input grid. These cells will form a smaller grid within the overall input grid. Transfer these cells and their colors exactly to the corresponding positions in the output grid. All other cells in the output grid should be green. This effectively shrinks the overall size of the grid while maintaining the arrangement and colors of the non-green cells.\\\\n5. To make the output, you have to reduce the grid. For each 2x2 square in the input, pick the cell that is different from green in the top left quadrant. If the top left quadrant of the 2x2 square is all green, then use the non-green cell from the other quadrants of the 2x2 square. If all cells within the 2x2 square are green, then the corresponding cell in the output is green. The result is a reduced grid in which every cell corresponds to a 2x2 square in the input grid.\\\\n6. To make the output, you should extract the locations of the dots/spots of other colours from the input and represent them by their respective colours in the output, where the rest of the grid remains the same colour as the main background colour in the input. The relative position of these spots should remain the same in the output.\\\\n7. To make the output, you have to find the foremost and the farthest instance of each colored pixel (any color other than 3 for 1st example, and any color other than 4 for others) in the input grid and build a new grid covering all these points. Replace the numbers from input grid to the output grid at corresponding positions but replace all other areas with green in 1st example and orange for other examples.\\\\n8. To make the output, you have to shrink the input grid by taking every third cell/number in both directions, starting from the third row and the third column (0-indexed). Any cell X in the output is the cell at (3*X_row, 3*X_column) in the input.\\\\n9. To transform the grid, a pattern is formed based on the first occurrence of each distinct colored shape within the input grid (excluding the dominant color making up the larger grid). The output then is reminiscent of a x-ray, a condensed, mini version of the original grid where the distinct color pattern, formed by the shape fragments, is mapped.\\\\n10. To make the output grid, you should extract a 5x5 grid from the asymmetric center of the input grid. The distinct colors from the diagonals, as well as the unique color from the center, should be maintained in the output.\\\\n11. To make the output, you have to consider the pattern within the main 3-filled grid which is separated by the number 4 (Yellow). Each square in the output corresponds to one of these inner patterns, using the most occurring number if there are several numbers in the pattern (not including 3), or 3 (green) if there is no other number. For cells which are crossed by the number 4 (yellow) line, you consider the number which is above the line. The obtained pattern is put in the center of the grid, with all the corners filled by the number that surrounded the corners in the main 3-filled grid.\\\\n12. To make the output, you have to shrink the input grid by a factor of 2 in each direction, rounding down if necessary. For each 2x2 block in the input, take the top left cell\\\\\\'s color. Then, replace the green color by 2 (red), blue by 4 (yellow), teal by 1 (blue), purple by 3 (green), and yellow also by 1 (blue).\\\\n13. The grid transformation involves scaling down the grid while maintaining the relative positions of the different colored squares. When the grid is divided into sets of three rows or columns, only certain cells where colored squares are present will be retained in the output according to a specific pattern.  We observe which colors are at four corners and at the four side-centers on the outer boundary in the input grid. These observed elements are then placed as corners and side-centers respectively in a smaller grid.  In the grid, - The central square in output is the same color as the central square in input grid. - The top-center square in output is the same color as top-center square in outer frame of input grid. - The right-center square in output matches color with right-center square of outer frame in input. - The bottom-center square in output matches with bottom-center square of outer frame in input. - The left-center square in output is same color as left-center square of outer frame in input. - Top-left corner of output matches with the color of top-left square of outer frame in input.\\\\n14. To make the output, you should identify the pattern of colored squares in the input. Count the squares along the rows and columns of each pattern. Compress the row and column counts by a factor of two, and use this to obtain the number of rows and columns in the output. The colored squares in the output grid should reflect the pattern of colored squares in the input grid, but on a compressed scale.\\\\n15. To make the output, first you need to remove the dominant color completely. This will leave only the shapes or lines drawn by the other two colors on a black background. Then change the color of all the remaining cells to get the final output. Specifically, - Change cells with the original dominant color to black. - Change cells that originally had neither the dominant color nor black to 3 (green). - Change black cells surrounded by the dominant color to 1 (blue) or 2 (red), depending on the symmetry of the original pattern.  - Change cells that have black neighbors to 8 (teal).\\\\n16. To make the output, you have to look at the inner part of the input grid. Every color that is not green corresponds to a location on the output grid. Blue on the top left corner corresponds to the top left corner in the output, brown on the right middle part of the input corresponds to the middle of the right edge in the output, and so on. If a color is not present in the input, its output location will be green.\\\\n17. To derive the output from the input, identify the non-background colored cells on the input grid and place them on the smaller output grid based on their relative positions. The background colored cells should all be placed on the output grid according to their non-background colored neighbors.   For example, in case 0: The green cell in the middle of the input maps to the middle of the output. The teal cells at the edges of the input map to the corners of the output. The remaining non-green cells on the input (blue, yellow, red) map to the remaining cells on the output. Cells on the input which are green are placed on the output grid if they are immediately surrounded by two non-yellow cells on both their left and right side.  This is observed across the cases, thus the transformation involves shrinking the input grid while conservely preserving the pattern of colors, with the exception of green. The cells filled with green in the input grid are only transferred to the output grid under specified conditions, otherwise they remain empty.   In simpler terms, copy the pattern from the larger grid to the\\\\n18. To make the output, you have to shrink the input grid by a factor of 2. This is done by starting at the top left corner of the input and considering a square with sides of length 2. The color of the cell in the result grid is the color of the bottom right cell in this square. Then, shift the square two cells to the right and repeat the process. When the end of the row is reached, move the square to the start of the next row and continue.\\\\n19. To make the output, you have to do a nonlinear transformation. In the output grid, center square is the color of the center of the input i.e. input[5, 3]. Then the intersection of 2nd and 4th rows and columns are the same with the cells at the intersection of the 3rd and 2nd rows and columns of the inputs. The corner squares are also the same with the corner squares of each quarter of the input (e.g. top right corner of output = top right corner of top right quarter of input). All other squares in the output are the same as the original dominant color in the input square.\\\\n20. To make the output, you have to extract the non-green cells along with their immediate green border. Then arrange these cells in the same order they appear in the input from left to right and top to bottom.\\\\n21. To make the output, Collect the cells of different colors than the predominant color (here, green) from the input grid. The layout of these collected cells in order forms the target output grid. If the input cell\\\\\\'s color is green, change it to 1; if it\\\\\\'s blue, change it to 2; if it\\\\\\'s red, change it to 3; If it\\\\\\'s yellow, change it to 4.\\\\n22. To make the output, you should trace a cross-like pattern in the original grid, starting from the middle. This pattern extends to the left and right row, follows a straight line into the center row, skips one square, then extends to the last row. Copy these colors to the new grid in the same cross-like pattern. All the other spaces in the output grid should be filled with the dominant color of the input grid.\\\\n23. To make the output, take the non-green squares and their surrounding greens squares. The surrounding green squares are the green squares that are adjacent in the x and y directions to a non-green square, but not in the diagonal direction. The output grid should show a grid of green squares in a sea-like fashion with the non-green squares acting as illuminating lighthouses. The positions of the non-green squares in the output grid correlates to the arrangement and location of non-green squares in the input grid. There is also an additional transformation where each non-green square takes the color of the non-green square next in the sequence (blue to teal to red to yellow to blue and so on).\\\\n24. To make the output, focus on the group of red squares in the input grid. The output grid should take the form of a cross, with a red square in the center. The arms of the cross are 5 squares long, and the ring of green squares directly adjacent to the arm are all blue. The rest of the grid is filled with green squares making up the remainder.  The red squares represent intersections in the cross (center and ends), and the blue squares represent where a red square was adjacent in the input but not an intersection. The rest is filled with green.\\\\n25. To make the output, you only need to concern with 5 distinct points: the center point, the two middle points on the first and last row, and two middle points on the first and last column. The position of blue, yellow, red and teal if existed in the input grid would correspond to the output position. The remaining points in the output grid are populated by the majority color of the input grid (green in case 0, blue in case 1 and yellow in case 2).\\\\n26. To transform the input into the output, you need to reduce the size of the input grid by compressing it in such a way that a group of around 5x5 cells in the input map directly to a single cell in the output. The color of the output cell should be determined by the color that appears in the central cell of the corresponding input group. In cases where the group from input doesn\\\\\\'t have a direct central cell, you can consider the color most present in the group.\\\\n27. To make the output, you have to select two points equidistant from the grid center along the same axes. Form lines along each of the two chosen points, so that a cross forms. The intersection of the lines creates the grid center. Copy the colors on those points to the corresponding 5x5 output grid. Fill in the rest of the output grid with the primary color of the input grid.\\\\n28. To make the output, you have to select the row collinear with the line shaded with a non-green color, repeat this for the column. The resulting square is the output shape with its corresponding shade as in the input.\\\\n29. For transforming the grid, consider two points of another color (blue in case 0, teal in case 1, red in case 2) which are on the same vertical line and take the elements between these points. In the same way, focus on the elements between two different colored points which are on the same horizontal line (grey in case 0, brown in case 1, orange in case 2). The intersection of these elements forms a sort of cross shape in the center. Surround this by the predominant color in the input, filling up to the 5x5 grid size.\\\\n30. One rule applies to this transformation.  The rule is to keep the secondary colors and the cells adjacent to them while removing all the other cells. This forms a cross or \\\\\\'X\\\\\\' shape in the output. The center of the cross is the previous color (blue, red, or blue) or a new one (brown). The arms of the cross are filled in with the secondary color(s) from the input, depending on their position relative to the center. Specifically, use the color of the top left corner for the top and left lines of the cross, and the color of the top right corner for the right and bottom lines. The rest of the cells are filled with the primary color from the input.\\\\n31. To make the output, you have to compress the input in both directions, so that every four cells in the input correspond to one cell in output. If there is at least one cell of a particular color within these four cells, the output will contain that color. When multiple colors are present within the four cells, prioritize the color by order of most to least priority: blue, teal, red, grey, and then green.\\\\n32. To make the output, you have to extract the area that surrounds the cross (about two cells thick) and display it along with the cross. The rest of the cells aren\\\\\\'t needed for the output.\\\\n33. To make the output:  1. In the center of the grid there is a 5x5 square of green cells. Any other color chosen in this square is placed at the corresponding position in the output grid. The rest is filled with green cells.  2. Any color that appears twice in the center 5x5 green square of the input appears only once in the output grid.  3. In cases where an input color cell repeats exactly twice in the center 5x5 square, the output cell is placed wherever the latter cell was found in the input. For example, if there are two blue cells in the center 5x5 square, at positions (1,2) and (3,4), because (1,2) < (3,4), the output has blue at (3,4).  4. The output grid is always a 5x5 square. The \\\\\\'extra\\\\\\' cells in the input grid are effectively ignored.\\\\n34. To make the output, first draw a diamond shape from left top, right top, right bottom and left bottom, the cells on the diamond border should be filled with the color of the top left pixel of the input grid. Everything inside the diamond should be the main color of the input grid. Exceptions to this are the middle cell (which should be the color that is not on the border nor the main color) and the left and right middle cells of the diamond (these cells should take the color of randomly placed different color cells in the input grid that is not along the top border). Everything outside the diamond shape should be black.\\\\n35. Begin by identifying every 3rd element (hence reducing the size of the grid) horizontally, vertically and diagonally, starting with the first element. Keep the colored cells and fill the rest of the grid with green cells. This transformation gives us a downscaled grid with preserved pattern from the input.\\\\n36. To make the output, you have to consider only the colored squares in the input, which are not of the dominant color, and copy their arrangement into the output grid maintaining their relative positions but scale down the whole pattern into the center of a 5x5 grid. Empty spaces in the output grid are to be filled with the dominant color from the input grid.\\\\n37. To make the output, you need to shrink the original grid by a factor of two. Each cell in the new 5x5 grid corresponds to the center of each 2x2 cell in the input grid. If the values of the cells in a 2x2 block aren\\\\\\'t the same, take the value of the cell in the bottom right.\\\\n38. To produce the output, you have to shrink the large input grid into the 5x5 size maintaining the symmetry. The rule would be to take the middle five rows and columns (counting full rows/columns even split by the middle row or column in the grid) and within them, take the first, middle and last elements. Remember the symmetric structure. For the central three rows/columns, preserve the middle value, if any, otherwise use the bordering color, which is mostly dominant in the input grid.\\\\n39. To make the output, identify the color that fills the largest part of the grid: let\u2019s call that color A. Color B is the color that appears in the middle of the grid, and color C is the remaining color.   The output grid should be primarily filled with color A. Four squares will contain color B, which are located in the corners of the output grid. The rest nine squares will contain color C, they form a cross in the middle of the output grid.\\\\n40. To make the output, you need to create a 5x5 square in the center of the grid. The center of this square corresponds to the center of the original grid. The squares surrounding the center square in the smaller grid corresponds to the points that are 4 points horizontally or vertically away from the center in the original grid. The four corners of the smaller grid corresponds to the points that are 4 points diagonally away from the center in the original grid.   For example, in Case 0, the blue square in the dead center of the input grid corresponds to the center square in the output grid. The teal and red squares appear 4 points away from the center in the original diagonally and horizontally, respectively, and so they appear on the corners and sides of the output grid.\\\\n41. To make the output, you need to remove all green blocks of the same configuration. Then, you need to shrink the grid, reducing each sequence of four consecutive blocks of the same color to a single block. In other words, you should average the colors in each 4x4 subgrid to get the corresponding color in the output, so all blocks in one color of the input grid will be transformed into one block in the output grid. If there are multiple different colored blocks in the 4x4 subgrid, use the color that appears the most. If there\\\\\\'s a tie, use the color with a lower number. Keep the blocks that are in different colors.\\\\n42. To make the output, you have to keep cells with other colors other than the main color and the cells in between them. Find the first appearance of a cell with a different color and the next cell with the same color in any direction. Keep these cells and the cells in between them while remove all the other cells to create the output grid.  The cells in between the pair of cells with other colors are included in the output grid, the rest of the grid is not included. This way, a reduced pattern is created in the output from the larger pattern in the input.\\\\n43. To make the output, you have to identify and locate sections with different colors from the main color in the larger grid input. These colors appear symmetrically scattered on the larger grid. Place these colors in the corresponding locations in the smaller, 5x5 grid, following the layout of the colors in the larger grid. Fill the remaining spaces in the 5x5 grid with the main color from the larger grid.\\\\n44. To make the output, you have to map all the cells off the cross shape to black. Then, shrink the grid size down to the cross size only, by discarding any black cells. Please note that the intersection of the cross remains the same color. The rest of the cells on the cross takes the color of the most peripheral coloured cell in the quadrant relating that part of the cross.\\\\n45. The transformation involves taking the cells at the middle and corners of the input square and placing them at matching positions in the output square. The rest of the cells in the output square have the same value as the most common value in each quadrant of the input grid. For instance, the value of the central cell of the output corresponds to the value of the central cell of the input, the values of the corner cells of the output correspond to the values of the corner cells of the input, and the rest of the values in the output come from the most common value in each quadrant of the input.\\\\n46. To make the output, transform the grid by counting the green cells in all four directions till a different colour cell is met. Then, the colour of the different cell becomes the centre point of the output grid. Draw a cross pointing towards all four direction from this centre point to a length matching the count of the green cells. Fill the remaining cells with green colour.  This means that we should only proceed in reproducing the cells which are not green till we meet a green cell. Once a green cell is met, we stop reproducing and make all remaining cells as green.\\\\n47. To obtain the output grid, track the color numbers in the main bigger square and put them into smaller square matching their relative arrangement. Number values from inside color squares are arranged in the smaller size output grid having exact same sequence and relative position as they were in the input. Each second cell is set to the color of the large square. If there are fewer than 4 color squares inside the large square in the input, ignore the spare cells in the output and only paint the center ones.\\\\n48. To make the output, you have to divide the original grid into four equal parts and mirror the top part of each quarter in the corresponding part of the final grid. The mirroring should copy any colored part on the top half of each quadrant to the corresponding location in the final grid (map the upper left quadrant to the upper left of the output grid, the upper right quadrant to the upper right of the output grid, and so on). For cells in the middle line of input grid, which belong to both upper and lower quadrant, replicate them in both cells in the middle line of output grid corresponding to both quadrants. If the positions overlap, the color number from the lower quadrant should be taken. So, replicate the color number from the lower quadrant last.\\\\n49. To make the output, you need to scale down the input so that clusters of three colored squares in the input become one square in the output. This is achieved by taking a 3x3 portion of the input grid and reducing it to a single square in the output. The color of this square is determined by the color of the central square in the selected 3x3 section of the input. Repeat this process until you\\\\\\'ve covered the entire input grid.\\\\n50. To make the output, you first need to isolate the larger box which is typically a 3x3 or 5x5 square. You then need to compress the larger box by folding it on itself in such a way that the cells of four corners of the square are converging to center and the remaining cells are obtained from a particular procedure on the cells that are on the sides of the large square.   For example, in Case 0, the first corner cell (top left) of the 5x5 square comes from the first cell of the topmost row, the second from the first cell of the rightmost column, the third from the first cell of the downmost row and the forth from first cell of the leftmost column respectively. The center cell comes from the cell which is at the fourth row and third column.  The remaining cells are obtained from middle of the side of the larger square. If we consider the top side,\\\\n51. To make the output, you have to identify the symmetric points (or configurations) of different colors other than the main color in the input grid and arrange them in the same relative positions in the output grid, but scaled down to fit the 5x5 size. All other spaces should be filled with the main color from the input grid.\\\\n52. To make the output, you have to look at the corners of the initial large grid and create a new smaller grid keeping the colors of the corners. However, if an edge exists between the corners the first color appears in the top left, the second in the top right, the third in the bottom left bottom and the fourth in the bottom right corner of the smaller grid. These colors keep repeating in a diamond pattern until they reach the center of the new grid which should always be a green square.\\\\n53. To create the output, define the center cell of the grid as the middle cell of the grid in both rows and columns.   Then, at each cell in the output, place the color found in the corresponding position counting from the center of the input grid. For the top left cell of the output grid, find the color by moving up and left from the center of the input grid, top right cell is found by moving up and right and so on. Do this for each of the cells in the output until the output grid is fully filled.\\\\n54. To make the output, you have to consider the cells that are not green in the grid. This cell must be transferred to the output grid at the same position if it is within the 5x5 grid. Transform a cell that is not green in the input grid to the same colored cell in the output grid only if the cell in the input grid falls within the bounds of the 5x5 output grid. If the cell is outside the boundaries of the 5x5 grid, ignore it. All other cells in the output grid should be green.\\\\n55. To get the output grid, capture only the cells of the input grid that have a different color than the dominant color. Align these cells in their respective horizontal and vertical patterns to form the output grid. The dominant color in the input grid turns into black (number 0) in the output grid.\\\\n56. To make the output, you have to find all unique colors, excluding green, and recognize their symetric position to form a smaller square grid. The green color from the input should be retained at the same relative positions in the output, and other colors from the input should be in the same relative position in the output as they are in the input. If there isn\\\\\\'t any color at a position in the input, put a green color at this position in the output.\\\\n57. To make the output, the transformation starts by selecting the central element of the input grid. Then, elements that are at the same relative positions with the selected central element are picked from the four corners of the grid. This forms a square arrangement that is repeated symmetrically: the central value is surrounded by four squares of the initial color and four other values different from these two. The values correspond to those at four specific positions in the input: top-left and bottom-right corners, middle of the top side, and middle of the bottom side.\\\\n58. To make the output, you need to zoom in to the pattern that is formed by the 4 dots of the same color, which also includes the vertices of the yellow square. The color of the output grid is determined by the color of the dot: normally they are the color of the larger square, except for the locations of the 4 dots, then they get the color of that dot. The centre of the output grid always gets the color of the larger square.\\\\n59. To make the output grid, the pattern is extracted from the input grid in a cross shape: The output grid starts at the leftmost occurrence of the first color in the input grid (leftmost blue in Case 0, top teal in Case 1, leftmost blue in Case 2). It then includes the five colored elements in the shape of an \"X\" or cross (up, down, left, right, and center). If the cross pattern is situated at the border (like in Case 1) then we consider the cross pattern from the middle of the grid where color is present. In the case of multiple possible patterns, choose the one that is closer to left side of the grid.\\\\n60. To make the output, you have to take a 5x5 grid from the approximate center of the input grid. Any square that is a different color in the 5x5 grid should remain that color in the output grid. Any square that is the same color as the majority in the input grid should remain the majority color in the output grid.\\\\n61. The transformation involves condensing the pattern observed in the input grid. The output grid retains the same general form observed in the input grid, but with a reduction in size. The vertices of the cross observed in the input grid correspond to the center of the cross in the output, with the same color coding. The cells that are at the midpoints of the arms of the cross are maintained at the respective midpoints in the output, however, instead of having cells of two colors, only the bottom color is retained. The cells at the ends of the cross are retained at the respective ends in the output, but instead of having two colors, only the top color is retained in each case. All other cells in the output are colored green just like those in the input.\\\\n62. To make the output from the input, you need to look at the input as made up of a larger 5x5 grid of boxes, each the size of the output grid. The color in each cell of the output corresponds to the center cell of the corresponding box in the input. If multiple colors appear in the centers of the boxes, you should choose the color that appears most frequently. If there is a tie, prefer the color that comes first when reading from left to right, top to bottom. If the center cell of the corresponding box in the input is the background color, the output cell should be the same color as the majority of other cells surrounding the center cell in the input. If there is no majority, then the cell should remain the background color.\\\\n63. To make the output, you must select all cells that are not the dominant color. Translate these cells into a new grid maintaining their shape and retaining their color. The output colors for each color found in the input grid is as follows: orange and blue yield output 1, gray and teal yields output 3, blue and red yield output 2.\\\\n64. To generate the output from the input, imagine that a template is used to extract a diamond-shaped pattern from the input. The diamond\\\\\\'s vertices touch the four cardinal points (North, South, East, West) of the grid. Any color that falls within this shape is carried over to the output, while the majority color becomes the default or background color of the output grid. To be specific, the diamond shape always has 5 cells on each side.  The operation does not affect the values/colors of the cells, it just re-positions them or basically filters them from the larger grid to the smaller one. Also notable to mention is how the pattern is symmetric about the main diagonal.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "Category 1: Scaling down the grid by skipping rows and columns\nRule: To make the output, you have to scale down the input grid by skipping a certain number of rows and columns, starting from a specific row and column.

To make the output, you have to mirror the colors from the first column of each 4x4 square onto the 3rd column within that square. Similarly, mirror the colors from the first row of each 4x4 square onto the 3rd row within that square. The colors on the black cells stay as black.\\\\n2. To transform the grid, you need to change the color of the third position in the first and fifth row from blue to the color of the fourth position in the first and fifth row of the first quarter, respectively. Make these changes to all the quarters.\\\\n3. To make the output, look at cell in the middle row of upper and lower quadrants. If a cell in the upper quadrant is colored (not black), then any corresponding colored (not black) cell in the middle row of the lower quadrant has to be changed to the color of the cell in the upper quadrant. The same rule applies vice versa (that is, if a cell in the lower quadrant is colored, any corresponding colored cell in the upper quadrant should be changed to match it). The black cells remain untouched. Transform the grid this way for both sets of quadrants.\\\\n4. To make the output, you have to replace the blue color cells with any other color present in that specific half of the grid. The replacing color cells are actually the colors which are different from blue. Please note that the grid is divided into two halves, so make sure to consider only the colors present in the specific half for replacements. The process is for the 2nd and the 5th, column mostly in all inputs. The rest of the cells should remain the same.\\\\n5. To make the output, you have to move each color inserted in the 4th or 7th column of each quadrant to the middle column of the same quadrant while retaining the pattern of the remaining grid.\\\\n6. To make the output, fill non-black squares in each line with the color of the non-blue square. If there isn\\'t a non-blue square, the line stays the same.\\\\n7. To make the output, you have to duplicate the number from 4th column to the 6th column for all rows.\\\\n8. To make the output, you have to copy the middle position of each quadrant to its opposite position in the same quadrant, across the black line. The dividing black lines and the rest of the number positions remain the same.\\\\n9. The transformation rule here is to mirror the entire row across the fourth and fifth columns when there is a colored cell in the first 4 columns, while keeping the black cells intact. If the input row has colored cells in the 5th column to 8th column (right side), it does not affect the transformation; the output is determined by the left side only.\\\\n10. To make the output, you have to copy the color of the non-black (not part of the X) squares towards the center of the grid, following the path of the X shape. Therefore, the colored squares appear twice on each row: at their original position and at symmetrical position according to the center of the grid.\\\\n11. To make the output, you have to identify the non-blue colored cells in each 4x4 square. Then replace all the blue cells in the same diagonals with the identified color. If there is no other color except blue, keep the blue cells in the diagonal.\\\\n12. To make the output, you have to mirror the highlighted squares (either yellow, teal, or orange) from the left half of the grid to the right half of the grid, at the corresponding positions. The blue and black squares remain the same.\\\\n13. To generate the output grid, start by copying the input grid. An operation should then be applied to each 4x4 quadrant individually. This operation consists of identifying the distinct color (if any) that is only present in the middle 2x2 square of the quadrant. If such a color is found, replace all the blue cells in that quadrant with the identified color.\\\\n14. To make the output grid, look at each central vertical strip (which goes across the third and sixth indices of each row in the input grid). Then replicate the color of the non-blue boxes that are present in this vertical strip across the equivalent places in the first and fourth vertical strips of each section. If there is a blue box in the third or sixth position, do not change the color of the boxes in the equivalent places in the first and fourth positions - leave them as blue.\\\\n15. To make the output, you need to copy the 4th column from the left and replace the 5th column with it, without making any changes to the rest. The transformation can be described as a mirroring operation, where the center of the grid works as a mirror line and the 3rd and 4th column from the left are mirrored onto the 5th and 6th column.\\\\n16. To make the output, you look at each quadrant in the input. If a quadrant has a cell that is not blue or black, this different color should fill all the cells at the same position within this quadrant. Other cells remain unchanged.\\\\n17. To make the output, you must replicate the colors of the different color cells in the mirrored pattern across the line of black cells to the position in the pattern opposite the line.\\\\n18. To make the output, you have to copy the center cell of each quadrant (positions (1,3), (1,5), (5,3), (5,5) respectively) to the side cells of the respective quadrant (positions (1,1), (1,7), (5,1), (5,7) respectively). The remaining cells are kept unchanged.\\\\n19. To make the output, you have to mirror the colors from the 2nd cell (from each side) of the top and bottom squares, horizontally to their corresponding squares. The mirror axis should be the horizontal centerline of the sub-squares. Please note, there is a black line running across the middle of the overall grid, which does not change.\\\\n20. To make the output, you need to fill in  any colored boxes found in the upper and lower two squares of the input grid to the boxes in the same row but in the middle two squares. The rest of the boxes remain unchanged.\\\\n21. Each row in the top and bottom sections are reflected onto the same row in the middle section so that it mimics the pattern of the non-blue boxes in the top and bottom rows. To be specific, the first and fourth cells in the center section row are changed to match the first and fourth cells of the corresponding row in the top and bottom sections.\\\\n22. A transformation is applied to the inner cells (fourth and sixth rows) of sections. This transformation copies the color of a cell adjacent to a black cell at the top or bottom (if any) and fills toward the right, replacing the existing cell color in the middle. The other cells are left untouched.\\\\n23. The transformation pattern mostly focuses on the center strip of each part of the grid pattern (4th and 5th columns). Whenever the pattern is not symmetrical in these two columns of each part, cells from non-blue colors adopt the color in the 4th column. The grid is split into two parts, the top 4 rows being one part and the bottom 4 rows being the second part. Both areas are processed individually. This has no effect on the cells which are part of the strip of black, they remain as is.\\\\n24. To make the output, you have to symmetrically replicate the color of the cell from the left side of each quadrant to the right side mirroring the position. For the quadrants that their left side contains two different colors, only the color of the bottom cell is replicated to the right side.\\\\n25. In the output, we match the fourth column and its mirror image from the input grid and reflect this color pattern on the middle two columns on those rows where they differ. The rest of the cells remain unchanged.\\\\n26. To make the output, you have to copy the colored parts on the 4th and 5th columns to the 2nd and 7th columns respectively for each line that contains colored parts. Black lines remain unchanged.\\\\n27. To make the output, you need to replace the fifth and sixth element in each row with the fourth and fifth element in that row. If any row has another non-black color (other than 1) in the fourth or fifth element\\'s place, this color is used for replacement.\\\\n28. The transformation goes as follows: if a cell contains a non-black color (other than blue), this color will replace the blue color in the corresponding cells of both horizontal rows separated by a row of black cells. Everything else remains the same.\\\\n29. To make the output, you have to look at the squares in the top left and bottom left of the 4x4 squares. If the squares are colored, regardless of the color, then the same color will also appear in the top right square of the same 4x4 square. It\\'ll also appear in the square in the bottom right of the 4x4 square, if it was originally blue.\\\\n30. To make the output, you have to replace the centre \\'blue\\' pixel in a row with the different colored pixel present in the same row for the four rows present in the top and bottom halves.\\\\n31. To make the output, you have to propagate the unique colors in each quadrant (i.e. the color that is not blue) to the surrounding cells of the same color in the same row. The unique colors should replace the blue cells in the same row. The black cells should remain untouched. If there are no unique colors in a quadrant, it will remain as is.\\\\n32. To construct the output grid, you have to modify the 4th column so that it matches the cell pattern of the 2nd column and the 6th column to match the 8th column within each of the three separate sections. Keep in mind that the transformation does not affect black cells(lines).\\\\n33. To transform the input grid into the output grid, look for rows that have a colored cell other than blue or black. When found in the top row of a pattern, copy that cell\\'s color to the corresponding position in the middle row of the respective three-row pattern. The rest of the pattern remains the same.\\\\n34. The transformation rule is simple. The column that contains a cell that is not blue or black (e.g. red or green or any other color), and the column after the column containing this cell, will have the blue cells replaced with that color. All other columns remain the same.\\\\n35. To make the output, you have to replace the blue color in the middle of the squares of the input grid with the color at the edges of the squares. You only consider the first and last rows/ellements of each square.\\\\n36. To make the output, the rule is to copy the color of the padding cells in the top group to the corresponding cells in the bottom group.\\\\n37. To make the output, you have to consider the element in the 4th column of the 5th-row (5,4). For the first, fourth, seventh rows, all elements that are not black must match the element at (5,4) except the blue cells. For the second row, all elements (including blue) must match the (5,4) except the black cells. This pattern is mirrored for the 6th column too (rows eight and five).\\\\n38. The transformation is applied only to the cells within a quadrant. On either side of the black line within a quadrant, any colored cell must reflect the color of the corresponding cell in the mirror position. If there is a slight discrepancy in color choice, the color from the left-most side of the quadrant should take precedence and swap with the color on the right-most side. All black cells stay the same.\\\\n39. To obtain the output grid from the input, find the 4 different colors in the two diagonal 4x4 squares in the input grid. The colors in the same location (x,y) in each of these squares need to be matched. If the lower-left 4x4 square\\'s cell has a different color from the blue, the same color must replace the matching cells ((x,y) and (4+x, 4+y)) in the two other 4x4 squares at the top-right and bottom-right of the grid.\\\\n40. Replace the blue cells in the right half of the 8x8 grid (except for the all black rows), with the color of the cell that is in the 4th column of each two-row section. If it\\'s black, there\\'s no change. If it\\'s a different color, replace the right half cells of that section with that color. The mirror symmetrical pattern on both sides of the black line seen in the input is broken in the output.\\\\n41. The transformation pattern involves swapping the colorful cells in the central row of both the top and the bottom 4x4 squares. The blue cells (marked 1) remain as they are. The colorful cells other than blue that are in the central row, should replace the blue cells in the same column of the other 4x4 square.\\\\n42. To produce the output grid, you need to mirror the non-blue color spots horizontally in each for the respective rows. Therefore, if there is a non-blue color spot in a row, there would be another one mirrored across the vertical center of the grid.\\\\n43. The transformation involves taking the unique colored squares present in the first and third quadrants of the input grid and mirroring them horizontally within their respective quadrants. Hence, any local change in color from blue in the fourth column of the first quadrant or the third column of the third quadrant gets mirrored to the first column of the first quadrant or the fourth column of the third quadrant respectively. This results in a symmetric pattern within the respective quadrant for the output. All other colored squares (blue or black) remain in the same positions as they were in the input grid.\\\\n44. Top and bottom halves of the grid mirror each other. However, for every row that contains unique colors other than blue, transcribe those unique colors to the corresponding position in its mirror counterpart row. Black cells (empty cells) do not affect the pattern and remain in their respective positions.\\\\n45. To make the output, you need to mirror the distinct color (3- green, 4- yellow, 7- orange) in the horizontal sections. The color should be mirrored from the zero index position (Left-most) to the middle dividing line and the same for the right side from the last index position to the middle. The second and fourth sections, which are entirely blue, remain the same.\\\\n46. To make the output, we replace the blue numbers (1) in the fifth column of every second and fourth row of each set of patterns with the color of the first column in the respective row. The aim is to mirror the first and fifth columns of every second and fourth row in each set of patterns.\\\\n47. To make the output, colors other than black or blue in the input must be mirrored across the horizontal middle line of the grid. Additionally, the same color is inserted in the mirrored position on the same side of the middle line. The black squares are static and do not change position.\\\\n48. The transformation of grid involves replacing the fourth and fifth columns of every non-zero numbered row with the color present in the fourth column of that row. If there\\'s no color present in the fourth column of the row, the fourth and fifth columns of that row do not change.\\\\n49. To transform the input into the output, start with the first row of corner box (colored or blue) on the top part of the grid, and change the other corners in the first and the third parts to the color used in that corner of the first row. Leave the middle part as it is (black). For instance, if the first row\\'s corner box color is yellow and is at the 4th position counted from the left, change the color of the 4th box in the top and bottom corner rows to yellow. Repeat the operation for all other corner boxes that are not blue.\\\\n50. To achieve the output from the input, the modification occurs only in the top left square within the 4x4 portions. This modification copies the distinct number from the first and last row of the lower left 4x4 square onto the respective fourth position of the first row and third position of fourth row in the top left 4x4 square. In simpler terms, if 4x4 squares are labelled A, B, C, D from top left to bottom right, the unique number coming in row 1 and 4 in C is copied at position 4 in row 1 and position 3 in row 4 of A. The rest remains unchanged.\\\\n51. Look at the fourth and fifth column of the grid. If there\\'s any coloured cell (non-black cell) in the fourth column, copy it to the corresponding cell in the fifth column within the same row. The colored cell to be duplicated should only be in the fourth column. If there\\'s a colored cell in the fifth column, do not copy it to the fourth column.\\\\n52. To form the output, replicate the value of the 4th column onto the 5th column on every row. The remaining layout is preserved as it is from the input to output.\\\\n53. To create the output, the transformation requires replicating the special square (with different color patterns) found in the upper and lower sections into the middle section. The color of the middle square directly across the black strip in the same column is copied to replace the middle square of the upper and lower sections. Black squares remain unchanged.   If the middle square in a column has a different color than the ones in the same column in the upper and lower sections, its color should be copied to replace the colors of those squares. If the middle square is the same as those, there is no change. The special squares in the middle section change the pattern in the same position in the upper and lower sections.\\\\n54. To make the output, you need to follow these steps. First, the black lines and the arrangement of blue remain untouched. The position that matches a coloured square in the top 4x4 square, should also be coloured the same in the bottom square and vice versa. In other words, if top square\\'s fourth column has a different colored square in the first row, then the bottom square should have that color in that position and vice versa. Every color other than blue is matched in the mirrored pattern.\\\\n55. To make the output, you have to copy the different colored squares or the pattern in 4th column and paste them to the empty black squares in the 6th column if there are any. This should be done in every row.\\\\n56. Each of the five sections colored in blue in the input grid reflects the pattern of the first quarter of the same section in the output grid. All black squares remain unaltered.\\\\n57. The transformation involves substituting the bottom-most figure in the middle of each section with the highest non-black figure of the same section. The bottom most corner of the figure is not substituted. The sections separated by the yellow line always have same configuration.\\\\n58. To make the output, you would need to copy the top right quadrant into the bottom left quadrant, replacing corresponding cells. The top right quadrant also copies the different color block exists. This process is analogous to mirror reflection.\\\\n59. To make the output, you have to change the middle column of each corner rectangle to the color of the square in the middle.\\\\n60. To make the output, you need to mirror the colors in the 4th column to the 5th column. The colors in the 5th column should be identical to those in the 4th column which means the grid now has a central symmetry.\\\\n61. To make the output, you have to mimic the color of the 4th and 5th columns in the upper half of each 4x4 block to the lower half of the same block. In other words, copy the colors of the 4th and 5th cells of the top two rows in each 4x4 block to the exact same columns in the bottom two rows of the same block.\\\\n62. To make the output, you have to mirror the values in the left half of each 4x8 rectangle within the grid over to the right half of the same 4x8 rectangle. The center two columns that intersect the yellow or red blocks and the black rows should remain undisturbed. The symmetry thus changes to only along the central vertical axis.\\\\n\"}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "After analyzing the rules, they can be categorized into eight distinct categories based on their similarities:\n\n1.

For each category, synthesize the rules into a single, specific rule that combines the ideas of all rules in that category, while clearly differentiating it from the other categories.\\\\nThe new rule should be as specific as possible, following the format of the given rules.\\\\nThe new rule should be applicable without any information from the original rules - i.e. it should be standalone.\\\\n\\\\nRules:\\\\n1. To make the output, you have to draw a blue line horizontally from the left end to the right end of the grid for each row that contains a gray square. Continue this line to the end of the grid even if there are no further gray squares in that row.\\\\n2. To make the output, you have to divide the grid into three equal parts horizontally depending on the position of the gray cells. Replace the black cells with blue color in each part where the gray cell is located in the input. The rest of the cells remain black.\\\\n3. To make the output, identify the row in which the grey cell resides. Then, turn all the cells of that particular row along with the row below it and the row above it into the color blue. Repeat this for all the grey cells. If a grey cell is present in the top or bottom row, ignore the row which does not exist. If the rows in which you need to paint blue overlap, continue painting.\\\\n4. To make the output, you have to divide the grid into three equal 3x3 sections (top, middle, lower). Each grey square in the input grid denotes the placement of the blue color in the output grid. If a grey square is in the top section, fill the top 3 rows of the output grid with blue color. Likewise, if a grey square is in the middle section, color the middle section in blue and if a grey square is found in the lower section, color the lower 3 rows in blue. If multiple grey squares exist in the same section color that section once only.\\\\n5. To make the output, you have to detect the grey cells in the input. Then divide the output grid into three equal parts horizontally. The top part will be filled with blue pixels if there is a grey cell in the top third of the input, the middle part will be filled with blue pixels if there is a grey cell in the middle third of the input, and the bottom part will be filled with blue pixels if there is a grey cell in the bottom third of the input. If a part does not contain a grey cell, the corresponding part in the output will be black. This transformation seems to be about detecting presence of a colored pixel in a region of the grid.\\\\n6. To make the output, the transformation can be considered as applying a \\'field of effect\\' to the grey dots in the input - each grey dot influences a 3x3 portion of the grid (with the dot at the center of this influenced portion), changing the cells within this region from black to blue. If a cell is within multiple fields (as seen in the second example), it should still only change to blue once, and not layer or intensify the color.\\\\n7. To make the output, you have to trace the positions of the grey cell. It represents the center of a 3x3 subgrid. In the output, paint the corresponding 3x3 subgrid as blue. If there are overlapping grid from different grey cells, paint the overlapping area as blue too. All other cells in the output remain black.\\\\n8. To make the output, note the row where each of the grey dots is situated. After that, fill the entire corresponding row in the output grid with blue. If there are multiple grey dots in a row, the output should still have only that row filled with blue.\\\\n9. To make the output, first divide the input grid into three equal horizontal sections. Each grey box in an input section corresponds to coloring that entire section in the output grid blue. If a section has no grey box in the input, it remains black in the output.\\\\n10. To make the output, for each row, count the number of grey dots in it and color an equivalent number of cells from that row in the output grid with blue starting from the left. The rest cells in a row will remain black. If the row in the input grid does not have any grey dots, the corresponding row in the output grid will be filled with black cells.\\\\n11. To make the output, first divide the grid into three 3x3 cells. Each time a gray square is found in one of these 3x3 cells, fill the corresponding 3x3 cell in the output grid blue. If the cell doesn\\'t have a gray square, it should remain black in the output.\\\\n12. To make the output, you have to mark a 3x3 square with blue cells where there is a grey cell in the input grid. You start from the top left corner and move right and down as needed. For each grey cell, if there is a grey cell in the row below, extend the marking to that row. If there is a grey cell in the column to the right, extend the marking to that column.\\\\n13. To make the output, divide your grid into 9 squares. For every grey cell in the input, it corresponds to another 3x3 square being turned blue in the output. The top left grey cell corresponds to the top left 3x3 square, the middle grey cell corresponds to the middle 3x3 square and the bottom right grey cell to the bottom right 3x3 square.\\\\n14. To make the output, we need to examine the grey squares in the input. Each grey square divides the grid into different sections. The first grey square from the top divides the top third, the second grey divides the middle third, and the third into the bottom third. When there is no grey square, fill in the entire grid as a section. Each section should then be filled with blue (1).\\\\n15. To make the output, imagine the input grid has been divided into 3x3 big squares and count number of grey squares in each big squares. If there is one grey square, fill the corresponding 3x3 big square in the output grid with blue. If there are two grey squares, fill the corresponding 3x3 grid in the output with blue. If there are three grey squares, fill the corresponding 3x3 grid in the output with blue and spread into the adjacent bottom 3x3 square.\\\\n16. Divide the grid into three equal sized layers horizontally, and for every grayscale cell found on the layers, turn the layer to blue cells. If a layer has more than 1 grayscale, it still just turns into blue layer.\\\\n17. To make the output, consider the areas divided by grey cells. In the first area from the top to the next grey cell, draw blue (1). Repeat this for all the separated sections.\\\\n18. To make the output, you have to draw a horizontal line of blue cells across the grid wherever a grey dot appears in the input. The line should span three consecutive cells, starting from the 4th cell from the left when the grey dot appears in the upper half, and from the 7th cell from the left when the grey dot appears in the lower half. If a grey dot appears in the last row, the line should span across the entire row. If multiple grey dots appear in the same row, only consider the one furthest to the right.\\\\n19. To make the output, you have to transform the grid into 3x3 regions and depending on the number of gray cells present, color the region in the output. For example, if one gray cell is present in a 3x3 region, color the corresponding region with blue in the output. If two cells are gray in a 3x3 region, color half of the corresponding region blue. If three cells are gray in a 3x3 region, color the entire corresponding region blue.\\\\n20. To make the output, you firstly need to divide the grid into three equal parts on both the x and y axis. Then inside each part, if there is a gray cell, turn all cells to blue cells. Otherwise, all cells remain black.\\\\n21. To make the output, you should determine a 3x3 square around the location of each gray spot (if the spot is not close enough to the edge of the grid, use as large a square as space allows). Then, replace all the cells in these squares with blue in the output grid.\\\\n22. To make the output, you have to draw an equal number of blue squares as the number of grey dots in the row. These blue squares should always begin from the left. If a row has no grey dots, leave it blank.\\\\n23. Each grid is divided into 3x3 sections, the position of the grey dot in the input grid determines which 3x3 section of the output grid will be filled with blue dots. If the grey dot is in the top left 3x3 section in the input grid, the top left 3x3 section in the output grid will be filled with blue. Similarly, if the grey dot is located in the middle 3x3 section of the input grid, the middle 3x3 section in the output will be filled with blue dots. And if the grey dot occurs in the bottom right 3x3 section of the input grid, the bottom right 3x3 section in the output will be filled with blue dots. If multiple grey dots occur in the same row, the corresponding rows in the output grid will be filled with blue dots.\\\\n24. To make the output, you have to first divide the grid into three equally sized sections of 3x9 rows each. Then, you take the row where a gray pixel is located in the Input, and change to blue the entire section of the corresponding row in the Output. If the gray pixel appears in more than one row in a section, all corresponding rows get changed to blue.\\\\n25. To make the output, draw blue lines horizontally (represented by number 1) for three columns wide starting from the column where the grey squares are positioned, all the way until the bottom of the grid. The blue lines should begin on the row of the first grey squares and continue downwards till the end of the grid. The lines will occupy the positions of the grey squares as well. Please note: if a later grey square appears on a column to the right of previous grey squares, the blue lines will widen to include the new column.\\\\n26. To make the output grid, you need to identify where the grey cells appeared in the input grid. Each row in the output grid has cells that change their color to blue, starting from the column number where the first grey cell appeared in that area/region of the input grid. The area/region here is defined as a 3x3 sector in the 9x9 grid. If there are no grey cells in that area/region, then the color of cells remains black for the corresponding row in the output grid.\\\\n27. To make the output, you have to turn all the squares in the same row and column as the grey square from the input into blue squares. Leave all other squares as black.\\\\n28. To make the output, you need to look at the grey squares. The row containing the first grey square from the top will divide the grid into the first part. The row containing the second grey square from the top will divide the first part into the second part, and so on, till the row containing the last grey square, which will divide the grid into the final part. Now fill the parts from the top with blue leaving the rest in black.\\\\n29. The transformation rule depends on the positioning of the grey blocks in the input grid. The grid is divided into three parts both vertically and horizontally. If a grey block is in any part (both horizontally and vertically), the whole part gets filled with a blue block in the output grid.\\\\n30. To make the output, you have to draw blue lines from the left of the grid towards right, covering the grey square and continuing until the limit of the grid. The lines have a thickness of 3 units. If there are more than one grey squares in the same column, the drawn blue lines will overlap forming a single blue area.\\\\n31. To make the output, the transformation involves coloring the grids in the squares according to the grey square location in the input. If the grey square is on the left side in a 3x3 square of the input, the corresponding 3x3 square area should be filled with blue cells on the left side in the output. If the grey square is in the center in a 3x3 square of the input, the corresponding 3x3 square area should be filled with blue cells in the middle in the output. If the grey square is on the right side in a 3x3 square of the input, the corresponding 3x3 square area should be filled with blue cells on the right side in the output. If more than one grey square present in a 3x3 zone in the input, you will fill the corresponding area with blue cells entirely in the output. In this task, the positioning of the blue area is more important rather than the exact location of the grey square in a 3x3 zone\\\\n32. To make the output, you need to divide the grid into three equal horizontal parts based on the location of the grey dots in the input. Then painted the each part blue from the left to the right successively where the grey dot located first.\\\\n33. To make the output grid, you have to look at the location of grey squares in the input grid. If a grey square is present in a specific 3x3 block, that entire block becomes light blue in the output grid. If a block in the input grid doesn\\'t contain a grey square, the corresponding block in the output grid remains black.\\\\n34. The transformation pattern involves replacing the sections surrounding grey dots and extending to the edge of matrix with blue dots (1). The first grey dot in the input grid causes the upper left 3x3 sub-grid in the output to be filled with blue dots. If there are two grey dots along the same column, the entire 3x3 horizontal band in the output grid that corresponds to the position of the lowest grey dot should be filled with blue dots. If there are two grey dots along the same row, the entire 3x3 vertical band in the output grid that corresponds to the position of the rightmost grey dot should be filled with blue dots.\\\\n35. Each grey cell in the input grid is signaling a 3x3 area in the output grid to be filled with blue cells. The area covered goes from top left edge to down right edge. If there are more than one grey cell on the same row, the blue areas can be extended horizontally.\\\\n36. To make the output, the transformation is made is by dividing the grid into thirds, both vertically and horizontally. The squares with grey dots become 3x3 blue squares in the respective third of the output grid. If more than one grey dot appears in a given area third, the area is occupied only once by a 3x3 blue square.\\\\n37. To make the output, you have to draw a blue line from the left border of the grid and stop at the column holding the grey square. Continue with this pattern for each row. If there is more than one grey square in a row, extend the line to the farthest right grey square. Meaning, the column that contains the rightmost non-zero number in each row determines where the line of blue squares stops.\\\\n38. To create the output grid, divide the grid into 3x3 blocks. Count the number of grey dots in each block. If the block contains one grey dot, color the whole block blue. If two grey dots are present, color two-thirds of the block blue. If three or more grey dots are present, color the entire block blue.\\\\n39. To create the output, iterate over each row of the grid. If a grey square is found in the input grid, fill the corresponding output row with three blue squares. The columns of the blue squares should correspond to the row number divided by 3. Rows are numbered starting from 0.\\\\n40. To make the output, you have to color all the cells blue in the 3x3 box that corresponds to the rows and columns where grey cells occur in the input grid. Here boxes are divided per three rows and three columns. If a grey cell occurs multiple times in one 3x3 box, still paint the entire 3x3 blue only once.\\\\n41. To make the output, create a blue 3x3 square corresponding to each grey square in the input. In the output, place these 3x3 squares in the position with the same row as the grey square in the input and having their leftmost column at the same column as the grey square in the input. If multiple grey squares are present in the same column in the input, consider the lowermost square for the positioning of the 3x3 blue square.\\\\n42. First, segment the input in 3x3 areas. If a grey cell is detected in the 3x3 area, fill the corresponding 3x3 area in the output with blue; if there is no grey cell in the 3x3 area, fill the corresponding area in the output with black.\\\\n43. To form the output from the input, place the grey cell in the 3x3 square that corresponds to the quadrant the grey cell is in. In other words, if the grey cell is in the top left of the input, it belongs in the 3x3 square (1,1) on the output; if the grey cell is in the top middle of the input, it belongs in the 3x3 square (1,2) on the output, and so on. The 3x3 square that the grey cell belongs in should be colored blue, and the rest should be black.\\\\n44. To make the output, you have to draw blue lines through each row that contains a grey pixel from the input. The lines should span the full width of the grid.\\\\n45. To make the output, you have to find the vertical slices in which the grey cells are located on the input grid. These vertical slices in the input then correspond to 3x3 blocks in the output where all cells are colored in blue. The specific block depends upon whether the grey cell was located in the upper, middle, or bottom third of the input. So bottom third grey cells correspond to the bottom 3x3 block in the output and similarly for middle and upper third grey cells.\\\\n46. To make the output, you have to fill each 3x3 block with blue color occupying a total of three rows. Each 3x3 block gets filled corresponding to the presence of grey cell in the three 3x3 blocks of input grid. If the grey cell is in the top 3x3 block in the input grid, the top 3x3 block in the output grid gets filled and so on. If there are two grey cells in two different 3x3 blocks of the input grid, then the corresponding 3x3 blocks in the output and also the 3x3 block following them gets filled with blue color.\\\\n47. The pattern in transformation is filling a certain area of the grid with blue cells as per the grey cell\\'s position. To transform the grid into the output, we need to find the location of the gray cells. You should then color the corresponding area of the output grid blue.  The grid is divided into three equal vertical sections, and the gray cell shows which section of the grid to fill with blue. If a gray cell is in the left third of the grid, the left third of the output grid gets filled with blue. If it\\'s in the middle third, the middle third gets filled with blue. And if it\\'s in the right third, you fill the right third with blue. If there are gray cells in multiple sections, all the corresponding sections should be filled with blue.\\\\n48. To make the output, you have to transform the dots (grey in color) into a 3x3 square of blue dots (3x3 subsection of the grid) positioned in the same region of the grid where the single grey dot locates in the input. If there are more than one dots in the same 3x3 region of the input grid, fill the entire 3x3 section of the grid in the output with blue.\\\\n49. To make the output, you have to  replace each black cell with a blue cell within a 3x3 block if there is at least one grey cell in the corresponding 3x3 block of the input grid. If no grey cell is found in the 3x3 block, keep the black cell as it is. Each 3x3 block of the output should be treated independently.\\\\n50. The overall grid should be seen as 9 squares of 3x3. For each block of 3x3, change the color to blue if there\\'s a grey square located in that block in the input grid. Blocks that do not contain a grey square should remain black.\\\\n51. To generate the output grid, you need to fill in an area whose size and location are determined by the position of the grey cell in the input grid. If the grey cell is closer to the top left, then fill the top left 3x3 section in the output with blue cells. If it is closer to the top right, fill the middle 3x3 section. If the grey cell is closer to the bottom right, fill the bottom right 3x3 section of the output grid. If there are multiple grey cells along the mid-row or mid-column, fill all the corresponding sections with blue cells. The rest of the output grid remains black (value 0).\\\\n52. To transform input to output, identify the location of the grey square(s). Divide the entire grid into 3 equal 3x3 squares or regions following rows from top to bottom. The region that contains the grey square should be filled with corresponding blue squares in the output. If a region contains more than one grey square, that doesn\\'t increase or change the intensity of the blue color in the output. If multiple non-overlapping regions contain a grey square, fill all those regions with blue squares in the output. The regions that do not contain any grey square remain black.\\\\n53. The output grid is formed by dividing the grid into three equal sections of 3x9 blocks each, horizontally. For each grey dot in the input grid, the corresponding output section is filled with blue dots. If a line contains more than one grey dot, it fills more than one section in the output grid.\\\\n54. To make the output, you have to replace squares based on the rows in which the colored cells (grey cells) are placed in the input grid. The rows that contain the grey cells in the input grid will be replaced by blue cells up to the column where the grey cell exists in the output grid. Rows that do not contain grey cells will remain black in the output grid.\\\\n55. To make the output, observe the location of grey cells. Draw square blue grid of size 3x3 where the grey cells act as a center of each square. In case of overlapping, the blue grid stretches eastward only. For any row, the first blue value that turns up transitions all subsequent grey or black cells to blue.\\\\n56. To make the output, you have to identify the quadrant in which the grey cell is located (top left, center or bottom right). Once you have identified the quadrant, fill that entire quadrant of the output grid with blue cells. If there are multiple grey cells in different quadrants, merge the corresponding quadrants and fill them with blue cells. Apply this rule to each individual grey cell in the input grid. If there\\'s no grey cell in the quadrant, it should remain filled with black cells in the output.\\\\n57. Divide the grid into 3x3 quadrants. For each quadrant that contains at least one grey square, fill that entire quadrant with blue squares in the output. If a quadrant doesn\\'t contain any grey square, remain that quadrant with black squares in the output.\\\\n58. To make the output, count the number of grey cells on the bottom row. Divide the grid into three horizontal regions of equal size (3x9 in these two cases). From left to right, fill as many regions as the count of grey cells with blue cells, the unfilled cells remain black.\\\\n59. To make the output, you have to  fill each third of the grid with a different color. Blue squares should be filled in the third that follows where the gray square was. If more than one gray square appears in a row, ignore all but the first one.\\\\n60. To make the output, the transformation is done based on the location of the grey cells in the input grid. Where each grey cell represents the center of a blue square of size 3x3. Any other space remains black.\\\\n61. To make the output, you have to mark the whole column in the input channel with a blue color where the grey cell appears at least once. Fill the remainder of the cells in blue squares with blue and the rest of the cells in black.\\\\n62. To make the output, you have to recognize the 3x3 regions in the input that contains a grey cell. Then fill the corresponding 3x3 regions in the output with blue cells.\\\\n63. To make the output, three consecutive blue-colored squares(1) should be inserted at the row of grey square(5) occurrence, from starting in order of the grid. The pattern of blue-colored squares(1) should continue for all subsequent rows, regardless of the presence of a grey square(5).  If grey square(5) appears in subsequent rows in the same column, the entire row should be filled with blue-colored squares(1).\\\\n64.

For each category, synthesize the rules into a single, specific rule that combines the ideas of all rules in that category, while clearly differentiating it from the other categories.\\\\nThe new rule should be as specific as possible, following the format of the given rules.\\\\nThe new rule should be applicable without any information from the original rules - i.e. it should be standalone.\\\\n\\\\nRules:\\\\n1. To make the output, you have to perform the following steps:  1. Take the first four columns (the section with the yellow cells). 2. Replace yellow cells with the colors found in the corresponding locations in the final two columns of the input (third section) where blue cells are.  3. Replace the empty/brown cells in the output with the color found in the same location from the middle section of the input (brown cells section).  Following these transformation steps would give the desired output.\\\\n2. To make the output, you have to follow several rules. Each row in the output corresponds to each row in the input. The 1st column in the output is filled with the number from the 1st column in the input. The 2nd column in the output is filled with the number from the last column before the 2nd red column in the input. The 3rd column in the output is filled with the number from the first column after the 2nd red column in the input. The last column in the output is filled with the number from the last column in the input.\\\\n3. To make the output, you have to  select the first four columns of 4s, the middle column of 9s and the last column of 1s. Ignore the 2s and the remaining columns of 9s and 1s. The output is a 4x4 grid that combines the chosen columns in order.\\\\n4. To make the output, you need to select cells from the first and third sections that match the position of blue \"4\"s in the second section. If the cell in the third section is brown \"9\", keep it as it is. If it\\\\\\'s not \"9\", but there\\\\\\'s a blue \"4\" in the corresponding position in the first section, convert the value there to \"1\". If there\\\\\\'s no blue \"4\" in the corresponding position in either the first or third section, convert it to \"0\".\\\\n5. To make the output, take the outermost blue figures in the first 3x4 sub-grid and replace them with the corresponding colors (brown or blue) from the last 3x4 sub-grid of the input. The innermost blue figures in the first sub-grid should be left as is.\\\\n6. To make the output, you have to take each row of the left section in the input, look at the corresponding row in the right section. If there is more blue than black in the right section, make all the squares in that row of the output blue. If there is more black than blue in the right section, leave all the squares in that row of the output black. If there is an equal number of black and blue squares in the right section, check the number of browns in the corresponding row of the middle section. If there are more browns in the middle than black, make all the squares in that row of the output yellow. If there are less or equal number of browns to black in the middle, leave the squares in the output black.\\\\n7. To create the output, you start by copying the colours in the first column without the black tiles. Then, you move to the second column and look for the colour that appears the most number of times, discarding any black tiles. For the third column, you only select the colours that appear at least once in each row. If there is no such colour, then you output an orange tile for that row. For the final column, if there is a single blue tile in the input, copy it to the output. If there is no blue tile but there is an orange tile, output an orange tile. If there is neither a blue nor an orange tile, then output a black tile.\\\\n8. To make the output, you have to compare the first 4x4 section on the left with the 4x4 section on the extreme right. You will ignore the vertical strip of violet (color 2) and other colors within the right half section. When comparing, the transformation happens as follows: For each individual cell, if the color in the left square matches with the color in the right square, copy the color to the output. If it doesn\\\\\\'t match, take the most frequently occurring color in the 4x4 section of the right square as the output. The black cells in all sections are tool of separation or space, hence are ignored.\\\\n9. To make the output, you have to take the color of the square from the same position in the first and third sections of the input. If the color of the square in the first section matches with the color of the square in the third section, then the color of the square in the output is the same as them; If the color of square in the first section is black, then the color of the square in the output is equal to the color of the square from the same position in the second section; If none of the above conditions are met then the square in the output is of the same color as in the second section. In other words, the second section determines the color of black squares in the output, and the first and third sections determine the color of colored squares in the output.\\\\n10. To make the output, you have to divide the larger grid into the two 4x4 grids on either side and the single row of red cells. Then, for each 4x4 grid, if a blue cell has a 9 in the corresponding position in the red cell row, the blue cell remains blue in the output. If it does not have a matching 9 but is accompanied by a 1 in the blue 4x4 grid row below it, the cell turns into 1 in the output.\\\\n11. To make the output, first, notice the row of 2s in the middle of the input grid, divide the grid into the top and bottom sections along this line. Then, in each section, take a 4x4 portion that\\\\\\'s not on the central row of 2s and directly above or below it. This piece is around the quadrant where the Congress of brown elements is at. Then, transition all brown in the grid into black. The output should be this 4x4 portion.\\\\n12. To make the output, group every input row into four sets. For the first set include the first four numbers reading from left to right until the number two, for the second set only include the batch of 9\\\\\\'s right after the first number two and the batch of 0\\\\\\'s following it until the second number two, for the third set, include 1\\\\\\'s from the right until we encounter a non-1 number and the number right before the batch of 1\\\\\\'s, for the fourth set include four batches of 4\\\\\\'s. In each group, turn the 0\\\\\\'s into the highest number found in the group. Keep the 1\\\\\\'s, 4\\\\\\'s if they are still in the group. For any group if non of 1\\\\\\'s, 4\\\\\\'s, or 9\\\\\\'s are found, consider it as an error.\\\\n13. To make the output, you have to take each of the 4x4 \\\\\\'sub-grids\\\\\\' and perform different transformations based on the location of the \\\\\\'sub-grid\\\\\\'. If the \\\\\\'sub-grid\\\\\\' is on the left side of the input, flip it vertically. If the \\\\\\'sub-grid\\\\\\' is on the right side of the input, flip it horizontally. Then, for all \\\\\\'sub-grids\\\\\\', replace the the column of blue and black boxes that corresponds to the yellow box with brown boxes. Compile these four transformed \\\\\\'sub-grids\\\\\\' into a single 4x4 output grid, matching the relative locations of the \\\\\\'sub-grids\\\\\\' in the input grid.\\\\n14. To make the output, you need the position of a specific color box for each cell in the blocks of the row. For cells in the fuschia block, mark with fuschia the position of the first fuschia box in the red block. For cells in the red block, indicate with red the position of the first red box in the teal block. For cells in the teal block, use teal to indicate the position of the first teal box in the fuschia or blue block (whichever comes first from left). For cells in the blue block, use blue to indicate the position of the first blue box in the fuschia or red block (whichever comes first from right). If the color doesn\\\\\\'t appear in that block, make the cell black.\\\\n15. To make the output, you have to follow some steps for each cell in the left 4x4 square in the input grid. If the cell itself is black and the corresponding cell in the right 4x4 square (part of the 4x8 rectangle on the right of the middle column) is cyan, then the corresponding output cell should be fuchsia. Otherwise, if the cell itself is black and the corresponding cell in the right 4x4 square is black, then the corresponding output cell should be black. Otherwise, if the cell itself is cyan and the corresponding cell in the right 4x4 square is cyan, then the corresponding output cell should be cyan. Finally, if the cell itself is cyan and the corresponding cell in the right 4x4 square is black, then the corresponding output cell should be white. In summary, the pattern compares same-position cells in the left and right 4x4 squares and assigns a new\\\\n16. To make the output, you have to do the following steps: - Take the four rows one by one from top to bottom - In each row, for each cell from left to right, keep the first color in the cell if it\\\\\\'s the first appearance of this color in the row; otherwise, replace it with black. After this step, each row will consist of colors with only their first appearances from left to right. - Take the very first four colors of each row to make the 4x4 output grid.\\\\n17. To make the output, you have to take the largest group of the same color from each section and map those values to the output grid. From the blue section, extract the block of blue cells and place it in the corresponding positions of the output grid. From the fuchsia section, take the largest block of fuchsia cells and place it in the same positions of the resultant grid. For the last section, take the highest number of brown cells within a row and place it at the last position of the corresponding row in the output. If in a row, blue cells outnumber the brown cells or there are no brown cells, place blue at the last position of the corresponding output row.\\\\n18. To make the output, you have to take the leftmost colored box (not black) in each section for each row in the 4x4 grid. This is done along the 4x14 grid from left to right (ignoring the black boxes). Repeat the process for each row; the resulting 4x4 grid with the selected colored boxes forms the output.\\\\n19. To make the output, first, let\\\\\\'s consider the four horizontal lines of colored cells. For each of them, retain only the corresponding horizontal line in the output. Secondly, every fifth cell from the tenth cell onwards is colored gray. These gray cells should be kept in their respective positions in the output, whereas the remaining cells should be replaced with black cells. And lastly, the four cells in the far right column should stay in their respective positions in the output. If there\\\\\\'s a colored cell, retain that color; if not, the cell should be black.\\\\n20. To make the output, you have to copy the 4x4 square layouts from the input. Then, check the corresponding cells of each square to the bottom right cell of the corresponding colored line in the input. If the cell in the square matches that color, keep it as is, otherwise turn it into black. The only exceptions are the rightmost and the bottom cells, where you only look at the rightmost and bottom cells of the first 4x4 squares instead.   Additional notes: Here\\\\\\'s how this looks: if the leftmost cell in the top square is colored, and the last cell in the horizontal line is also colored, keep the cell colored in the output. If only one or none of them is colored, make that output cell black. For the rightmost and bottom cells in the output, only check the corresponding cells in the first 4x4 square.\\\\n21. To make the output, you have to take the first 4x4 square from the input and replace the black cells with the corresponding cells of the last 4x4 square from the input.\\\\n22. To make the output, you have to look at the 4x2 grid of red and black boxes in the input. If a box is the same color in both the 4x2 grid and the respective grid it separates, in the output grid, that box is replaced with the color of the box from the 4x2 grid in the lower row. But if a box is not the same color in both the 4x2 grid and the respective grid it separates, then the color of the box in the output grid is replaced with the color of the box from the 4x2 grid in the upper row.\\\\n23. To make the output, you have to consider each 4x4 square from the 14 columns and check the marking color (either brown or blue) within this square. If the marking color is brown, keep the same color as in the input, and if the marking color is blue, transform it into the black color or keep the original black color. The second 4x4 square should always be black in the output.\\\\n24. To make the output, you should focus on 1st and 2nd, 2nd and 3rd, 3rd and 4th, 4th and 1st quadrants respectively. For each cell, if the cells in both quadrants are the same, copy the value to the output. If not, check the 3rd vertical cell in the same row in 1st quadrant. If it\\\\\\'s black, the cell in the output is blue. If it\\\\\\'s blue, the cell in the output is brown.\\\\n25. The transformation involves selecting the color in the corresponding cell if it appears more times in the input grid (compared with the same cell in each of the 4x4 squares). If there is a tie, the leftmost color wins.\\\\n26. To make the output, you have to ignore the first and last five columns of the input and copy the remaining four middle columns to the output. The number to ignore (brown:9) in the section copied should be replace by the first cell in each corresponding row to the output. This suggests some sort of link or relationship between the cells in the row and the first position.\\\\n27. To make the output, you have to condense the three color blocks (blue, grey, red) to just one element. The blue block remains the same. The grey and red are replaced by the color of the left most cell of the second last column. The black blocks are replaced by the color of the left most cell of the last column.\\\\n28. To make the output, map each segment in the input grid to a corresponding cell in the output grid. For the first (blue) and second (red) segments, fill the output cell with the color of the pixel that appears most frequently in that segment. For the third (brown) segment, fill the output cell with the color of the pixel that appears only once (if any) in that segment. For the fourth segment, count the number of blue boxes. As for the filling color, fill the cell with a blue box if there\\\\\\'s any blue box in this segment, fill it with a red line if there\\\\\\'s no blue box but at least one black box, or leave it black if there\\\\\\'re no blue or black boxes.\\\\n29. To make the output, first, look at the 4x4 grid at the left section. If there is a 1x1 cell that is colored with blue, leave it as it is in the output grid. If the cell is black, check the corresponding cell in the 4x4 grid in the middle section. If that cell is brown, change the black cell in the first grid to a 1x1 brown cell in the output. If the cell in the middle grid is black, change the black cell in the first grid to a 1x1 grey cell in the output. Basically, the output grid is transforming all the black cells in the first 4x4 grid based on the corresponding cells in the second 4x4 grid, leaving the blue cells unchanged.\\\\n30. To generate the output, the blocks from the first, seventh, eighth and fourteenth columns of the input are copied vertically. If the yellow block in their row is followed by a fuschia block, then replace the corresponding block in the output grid with a green block.\\\\n31. To transform the input grid into the output grid, you have to take the first four columns from the input and glue them on the front part of the last four columns. Do this for every row. Then, take the maximum value from the middle six columns and place it in the corresponding row of column four in the output. Replace any black cells in the output with the biggest value from the corresponding row in the middle section.\\\\n32. To make the output, follow these steps:  Step 1: Divide the input into 5 equal segments column by column resulting in grids of size 4x3 except the last one being 4x2.  Step 2: Each of these segments represents the colors of the corresponding row in the final output grid ignoring black color (0).  Step 3: In the output, fill the respective row by the colors present in the corresponding segment from Input but in reverse order they appear and ignore if black (0) present in the segment.  Step 4: If there are not enough colors in the segment for the 4x4 output, fill the remaining cells with black (0) in the output grid.\\\\n33. To make the output, you have to identify the largest non-black number in each column of the 4x4 grid located on the extreme right. Replace each number in the corresponding column in the 4x4 grid located on the extreme left by this number. In the case where the column on the extreme right is comprised only black cells, the corresponding column on the leftmost 4x4 grid remains the same.\\\\n34. To make the output, for each row, extract the third character from the first segment, the second character of the second segment, and the first character of the third segment to form a 4x4 grid.\\\\n35. To make the output, you should consider each 4x4 sub-grid and transform it according to the following rules:  - If a given row has blue squares in the first 4x4 sub-grid, leave them as they are in the output grid. - If a given row has no blue squares in the first 4x4 sub-grid, replace the corresponding boxes in the output with brown squares where blue squares appear in the last 4x4 sub-grid.  - For the remaining black squares in the output, replace them with a blue square if a blue square appears on the same column of the second 4x4 sub-grid. - All other squares remain black.\\\\n36. To make the output, you have to extract the 4x4 grid from the first four columns of the input, replacing the 0s in it with the elements from the 13th column of the input, matching them by row.\\\\n37. To make the output, you have to look at the first 4x4 square of the input. Take the 3rd square:  - If it\\\\\\'s black, look at the 1st square of the corresponding position in the 2nd 4x4 square (the one to the right of the red line). The output will be the color of that square. - If it\\\\\\'s blue, look at the 2nd square of the corresponding position in the 2nd 4x4 square. The output will be the color of that square.  Repeat this process for each of the 4x4 squares to form the output grid.\\\\n38. To make the output, you have to navigate from the left side of the input grid to the right side. For each cell in the 4x4 area, you need to fill the corresponding cell in the output with numbers till you reach the first non-zero number that you encounter in the equivalent position. You repeat this for each of the 4 rows.\\\\n39. To make the output, rotate the 4x4 rectangle on the left side of the input grid 90 degrees clockwise.\\\\n40. To make the output, you have to take the cells from the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and last columns of the input grid and arrange them in a 4x4 grid. This means the first row of the output grid will be the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and last cells of the first row of the input grid. Repeat this for the remaining rows.\\\\n41. To make the output, you have to combine each of the two 4x4 grids on either side of the middle grid with the fuchsia cells by mapping yellow cells as blue and blue cells as yellow. If a cell in the right 4x4 is blue and the corresponding cell in the left 4x4 is black, keep it as blue for the corresponding cell in the output. If the cell in the right 4x4 is black and in the left 4x4 is blue put it black on the corresponding output cell. If both cells in the right and left 4x4 grids are blue, in the output it should be brown. If both cells in the right and left 4x4 are black, in the output it should be black as well.\\\\n42. The output grid is built by taking the first two blue squares from each row, adding a square that matches the first non-black square between the two sets of red squares (or black if there are no such squares), and finally adding a blue square if all the squares to the right of the red columns are black, else taking the first non-black square that appears in the row after the red columns.\\\\n43. Analysing the 2nd (red-black transition) and the 3rd (brown-black transition) 4x4 block in the input from left to right. For a cell in the output, if the cell in the equivalent position of the 2nd 4x4 block is black or the cell in the equivalent position of the 3rd 4x4 block is brown then copy the cell from the 1st 4x4 block otherwise copy from the 4th 4x4 block.\\\\n44. The first four columns of the input grid are copied directly to make the first four columns of the output grid. Then, find the color in the middle of the five columns in the section six to ten of the input grid, and place it in the last column of the output grid. If the middle cell of this section in the input grid is colorless, choose the color that appears on either side of this colorless cell.   This process repeats for each row.\\\\n45. To make the output, you have to take each row and create the corresponding row in the output by taking the third, sixth, ninth, and fourteenth columns from the input row. So, the first column in the output row is the third column in the input row, the second column in the output row is the sixth column in the input row, the third is the ninth of the input row and the last one in the output row is the last column in the input row.\\\\n46. To make the output, extract the first and last group of 4 cells from each row as they are in the input. So, the output grid is made up of the cells from the 1-4th columns and the 11-14th columns of the input grid.\\\\n47. To make the output, you have to eliminate the yellow row and the rows that have only black and red colors. The first colour of each row is based on the blue number on that same row before the first yellow number. The second and third colours of each row depend on the blue number between the yellow numbers in that same row. The fourth colour depends on the blue number after the last yellow number on that row. If no blue number is found, black is used instead.\\\\n48. To make the output, you will have to take the first colored cell from each section of the original row, omitting the red cells (so from the first section you will take the first yellow or black cell, from the second section the first brown or black cell and from the third section the first blue or black cell). You arrange these three cells in a new row in the output grid. You will repeat this for all four rows of the input grid, ensuring that the order is maintained so the first cell from the first row correlates to the first cell in the first row in the output grid and so on.\\\\n49. To make the output, mirror the left grid vertically into the top 3 rows on the right grid. If the box on the right has the same color as the mirrored box from the left grid, make the output box blue. Else if the right box is black and the mirrored box is colored, make the output box red. If both boxes are black, make the output box black. Finally, if the right box is colored and the mirrored box is black, make the output box blue if the colored box is present at least 2 times in the 3rd row on the right, otherwise, make the output box black.\\\\n50. To make the output, you have to compare the pairs of corresponding boxes of the large 4x4 grids. If a pair consists of two same color boxes (excluding black), replace them with brown in the output. If a pair consists of one black and one blue box, replace them with blue in the output. If a pair consists of one black and one dark green box, replace them with dark green in the output. If a pair consists of two black boxes, replace them with a black box in the output. Do this process for each of the pairs of corresponding boxes to get the output grid.\\\\n51. You need to pick four columns from the input grid to fit into the output grid. The first column of the output is the first column of the fuschia pattern, second column is the last column of the fuschia pattern, third column is the first column of the brown pattern and last column is the first column of the blue pattern. Romans\\\\n52. To make the output, it\\\\\\'s like dividing the input grid into thirds and compressing the middle third. For each row keep the first and last four boxes and remove the middle six. Additionally, replace an empty box in the first and last four boxes (0) with the first occurring color (other than 0) in the middle four boxes. If no such color exists, the box remains empty (0).\\\\n53. To perform the transformation, you should align left half of input grid and right half of input grid side by side, making sure to entirely disregard the six center columns. In other words, the output grid is the first four columns of the input grid followed by the last four columns.\\\\n54. To make the output: - For the first number in each row, pick the red number from the same row that is closer to the blue sequence at the beginning. If all red numbers are equidistant, choose the leftmost red number. - The next 3 numbers in each output row are the first three from the blue sequence of the corresponding input row.\\\\n55. To transform the grid, take each of the four 4 x 4 squares and select the corner corresponding to their position within the greater 2 x 2 layout. From the top-left square, take the top-left corner, from the top-right square, take the top-right corner, from the bottom-left square, take the bottom-left corner, and from the bottom-right square take the bottom-right corner. These four corners form the output 4 x 4 grid.\\\\n56. To make the output, you have to select the first four columns on the input. Then, on each row, change any 0 or black cell to the color value found in the ninth column of the input. If there is no black cell, leave the row unchanged.\\\\n57. To make the output from the input, take the 4 blocks from the far right section of the 4x14 grid, ignoring the black (0) block if it\\\\\\'s present. Assign them to the corresponding row in the 4x4 grid. Repeat this step for each group of blocks from right to left until the 4x4 grid is completely filled. In each group, if there is a brown (9) color in it, place the brown color in the first column of the corresponding row in the 4x4 grid. If the group does not contain a brown (9) color but contains a blue (1) color, place the blue color in the first column of the corresponding row in the 4x4 grid.\\\\n58. To make the output, you have to extract the picking information from one of the three 4x4 blue square views. The one you pick is determined by the last two rightmost squares on the last row of the input. If both squares are black, pick the first 4x4 square view, if the second to the last square is blue and the last one is black, pick the second 4x4 square view and if both squares are blue, pick the last 4x4 square view. Then, identify the locations of the teal squares in the 4x4 view; in the same locations in the output place the first color from the pair of colors immediately following the teal square in the middle six squares of the input. Everywhere else in the output where there are no teal squares, make those squares blue.\\\\n59. To make the output, you have to follow a set of rules. Firstly, keep the left-most 4x4 block as it is. Then, fill the rightmost spots of each row with a number that represents the sum of the numeric spots in the remaining right side of each row in the input. The stripes of a 2 followed by repeated 9s or 0s in the middle of the row, it\\\\\\'s worth to note that if we met 9 we count it as 0 and if we met 0 we count it as 1. At last, fill\\\\n60. To make the output, you have to take the middle set of 4 numbers from each row in the input grid, effectively removing the yellow stripe as well as a five-number chunk from each end of the row. The resulting 4x4 grid will have elements corresponding to the 5th to 8th numbers on each row of the input grid, in the same order.\\\\n61. To make the output, you have to extract the first four figures from each row of the input. In the output grid, if a row of the input grid contains at least one brown (1), change the entire row to yellow (4) and the brown (1) boxes to brown (9); else, if there is no brown (1) in a row, leave the row as it is.\\\\n62. To make the output, you have to map the left and right teal blocks to the respective squares on the left and right side of the output grid, ignoring other colors. The middle square in the output grid is mapped directly from the two brown blocks from the input grid. The top left output square is a copy of the top right input block preceding the second teal block, the top right output square is a copy from the bottom left input block after the first teal block, the bottom left output square is a copy from the bottom right input block preceding the second teal block and the bottom right output square is a copy from the top left input block after the first teal block.\\\\n63. The transformation pattern divides each row into three segments by the yellow squares. The squares on the far right side of each row follow a pattern where the first four squares to the right of the last yellow one are selected. The pattern is like this: if the square is red choose the left square of 4 consecutive squares after the last yellow block of the corresponding input row; if the square is brown choose the second square of 4 consecutive squares after the last yellow block of the corresponding input row, if the square is light-blue choose the third square of 4 consecutive squares after the last yellow block of the corresponding input row, if the square is black choose the fourth square of 4 consecutive squares after the last yellow block of the corresponding input row.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "After analyzing the rules, they can be categorized into eight distinct categories based on their similarities:\n\n1.

To make the output, you have to fill in the empty cells in each column with the color that is directly diagonally above them. If there are no colored cells above a black cell, it remains black.\\\\n2. To make the output, for each column, copy the color of the first block (not black) down to any black blocks below it, replacing any black blocks with this color. If no colored block is found in the column, leave it as black.\\\\n3. To make the output, you have to fill in the rest of the column with the colour of the topmost non-black cell in that column. If the column is all black, keep it as is.\\\\n4. To make the output, you have to fill the black cells in each row with the color that is present in that row. If a row only has black cells then fill the cells with the color present in the row above it.\\\\n5. To make the output, you have to fill the cells below the colored ones from top row with the corresponding color in the top row. All the black cells below a colored cell in the top row should be filled with the same color from top.\\\\n6. To make the output, you have to take the color of the cell in the first column of the first row. Replace all the black cells in the first column with it. Afterwards, take the color of the cell in the second column of the first row. Replace all the black cells in the second column with it. The same process should be repeated for the third column.\\\\n7. To make the output, you have to fill the black squares in columns with the color from the top colored square in the same column till you encounter another colored square. If there is no other colored square in that column then fill the column till the end.\\\\n8. Take the colour of the cell from the upper left cell (first row, first column) and apply it to all black cells on its right side and in the same row or in the rows below until you hit another color cell. Continue this for the remaining colored cells along the diagonal. This transforms the black cells on the bottom right side of a colored cell and within the same row to the color of that cell.\\\\n9. To make the output, you have to fill the boxes in the columns of the colored boxes on the top row with the color of the box in the center of the middle row.\\\\n10. To make the output, you have to fill the below diagonal cells with the colors of the cells that are above them in the same column. This is done by copy-pasting the color of the cell from the diagonal into all the black cells below it in the same column. Please note, the diagonal remains unchanged.\\\\n11. To make the output, carry the color from each diagonal cell along the row until the end of the row repetition. The diagonal line color in output is same as in input. The other cell color in output repeated color of their respective diagonal cell.\\\\n12. The transformation begins from the top row and works its way down. Starting from the first row, we fill each subsequent row with colors from the above row, following left to right precedence if the cell in the above row has multiple colors. Avoid filling in black cells (represented as \"0\"). Continue this process down the rows each cell in a row is filled with the color above it, if it was colored (non-black). The transformation is like a \\\\\\'gravity\\\\\\' effect on the colored blocks, pushing them down to the first black cell beneath them in the same column.\\\\n13. To transform the grid, we fill all black boxes in a row with the colored box in the same row.\\\\n14. To make the output, you have to fill the black cells below every colored cell with the color of the cell above, as if the color is dripping down to fill the black cells below the colored cell in the same column.\\\\n15. To create the output, you should fill all cells below a colored cell with the same color. If there are multiple colored cells across the column, use the color of the most upper cell. If the cell is black (0), it remains the same.\\\\n16. Start from the top, move downwards along the diagonal, where there are the colors, until you find a color that is not black and maintain it in sight. Once you found another color that is not black shift your sight to this new color. Apply this sighted color to the positions below this sighted color as long as they are black until you reach the last row.\\\\n17. To make the output, start from the top row and propagate the colored number assumed to be a color fill downward replacing the initial black cell (0) till you meet another colored number. If you meet another colored number, propagate this new color downward and continue in this manner till you reach the bottom row.\\\\n18. To make the output, you have to fill each row with the color of the cell that is colored in that row. If a cell in each row is empty, replace the black background with the color from the colored cell above it.\\\\n19. To make the output, you have to fill all the black cells below the colored cells with the same colors, maintaining the horizontal placement of the colored cells. Essentially, you pretend that the colored cells are ink and that it falls straight down, filling any black cells directly below them.\\\\n20. To make the output, you have to fill every black cell column-wise from the colored cell present in that column. The color of the filled cells should be the same as the color of the colored cell present in that column. If no colored cell is present in the column, it remains black.\\\\n21. To make the output, you have to color the black cells below the diagonal with the color of the cell at the same row of the diagonal.\\\\n22. To make the output, start with the input, then copy the colored boxes down the diagonal line from top left to bottom right, filling in the boxes below each colored box with the color of the box above.\\\\n23. To make the output, you have to fill the colored cell from the top right diagonally down to the bottom left. This includes the middle cell of the last row if the middle cell of the second row is colored. In other words, all empty cells (represented by 0) to the south-west of a colored cell (non-zero cell) is filled with the color of that cell.\\\\n24. To make the output, you have to fill the grid from top to bottom and left to right with the color of any non-black cell that occurs in the same column but at above rows. If there are no colors in that column above, leave it as black.\\\\n25. To make the output, you have to fill the empty spaces below each colored cell diagonically with the same color. If a colored cell already has a different colored cell below it, do not change the color of that cell.\\\\n26. To make the output, you have to drag down the colored numbers until they hit another number or the bottom of the grid. Fill the blanks with this color. It is like gravity happening from top to bottom and any colored number fill the empty space below it.\\\\n27. To make the output, you have to fill the cells in the first column (starting from the colored pixel and going down to the bottom of the grid) with the color of the pixel in the first column. Repeat the process for the rightmost column.\\\\n28. To make the output, you have to look at the grid column by column from the top to the bottom. If a column has a positive number, all the remaining black squares underneath that number should be replaced with that number. But if a column has only one colored square, the rest of that column stays black.\\\\n29. If a cell in the middle row is black/filled with number 0, replace it with the color of the cell directly above it. Similarly, if a cell in the bottom row is black, replace it with the color of the cell directly above it in the middle row. This essentially fills down any color to replace black cells in the column below.\\\\n30. To make the output, you have to fill the empty black squares in each column with the color of the square on the top in the same column. This basically means extending the color of the top square in each column downwards.\\\\n31. To make output, you have to fill the black cells by applying a two-step rule.  - Rule 1: For each black cell, if there is a colored cell to the left of the black cell, fill the black cell with the same color as the left cell. - Rule 2: If after applying Rule 1, there are still black cells, fill those cells with the color of the cell to the top.  Through this way, each black cell should be filled backwards horizontally first, and if there is no color to the left, it should be filled backwards vertically.\\\\n32. To make the output grid, the black boxes are filled with the color of the box immediately diagonally up-left. If the diagonally up-left box is also black (or doesn\\\\\\'t exist), keep this cell black. The colors from the colored boxes propagate towards the right and bottom part of the grid.\\\\n33. To make the output, you have to begin at the top left corner and maintain the color of the first non-black (colored) number encountered in each row as you move toward the bottom right corner, replacing the remaining black numbers in that row with the respective color. If no colored number is encountered in a row, copy the colored number from the above row and replace the black numbers in the same row in the output with the copied color.\\\\n34. To make the output, you have to  propagate the color value from the top-most non-black cell to all the cells below it in same column, replacing any black cell. If there is non-black cells above, the cell value remains black.\\\\n35. To make the output, start from the top row and move downwards. For every row, if a colored cell is encountered, then fill the same color in all the remaining cells of that row and all the cells below it. Continue filling the grid with this color until a new colored cell is encountered in the following rows. At that point, start filling with this new color.\\\\n36. To make the output, you have to fill the empty (black) squares with numbers from the flip 3x3 grid. Imagine flipping the grid around and copy the colored numbers into the black squares starting from the outermost layer.\\\\n37. To make the output, begin with the top row and fill the black cells by copying the colored cell from the same row. If a row consists of only black cells, copy the colored cells from the row just above it. Continue this until the entire grid is filled.\\\\n38. To make the output, you have to fill the black boxes below the color-filled squares with the same color. Basically, the colors in the grid are falling down, filling the black boxes below them, until they reach the other colored square or the bottom of the grid.\\\\n39. To make the output, you have to fill the black cells of each column with the color at the top of the column. If there is no colored cell at top, keep it black.\\\\n40. To make the output, replace blank (black) spaces in the middle column with the color from the corresponding row of the first column. Then, replace blank spaces in the right column with the color from the corresponding row of the middle column.\\\\n41. To make the output, you have to propagate the color of the cells diagonally from left to right, top to bottom. If a cell is empty (black), it will take the color of the coloured cell diagonally above it on the left (if it exists). The process continues until the bottom right cell of the grid.\\\\n42. To make the output, you have to fill the black cells with the colour of the cell that is above them. If the cell above is black, you continue with the colour above until you find a colored cell. If the topmost cell is black, you leave it as it is.\\\\n43. To make the output, you have to fill in the black squares of a column with the color of the last square in that column which is not black. If a column has no colored square, then it remains as black.\\\\n44. To make the output, you have to copy the color in the first column of each row to its remaining cells. If the cell of the first column is black, then you should take the color from the nearest colored cell that precedes it in the above row. In general, the pattern fills each row with the color of the first non-black cell when read from left to right.\\\\n45. To make the output, you have to fill the bottom rows with the colors of the diagonal cells above them. Start from the top and fill below with the current color, until you reach another color, repeat the process for each colored cell.\\\\n46. To make the output, you have to fill the first non-black cell in each column with the color of the topmost non black cell of that column, keeping all other cells the same.\\\\n47. To make the output, you have to fill in any black cells beneath non-black cells with the color of the above non-black cell, column by column. Leave the cells that don\\\\\\'t have any non-black cells above them as they are.\\\\n48. To make the output, you have to fill the empty spaces below each diagonal number with the diagonal number. The number in the diagonal stays the same, while the numbers below it in the grid are filled with the diagonal number.\\\\n49. To make the output, you have to follow these steps:  1. Identify the unique-colored line on the right, left or center. 2. Replace all black cells between it and the bottom row with the color of the unique line.\\\\n50. To make the output, you have to analyze the color of the non-black cells in the input.  The transformation works as follows: carry the colors of the non-black cells in the first row downward, filling the rest of the column. If there is another non-black cell in that column, it gets overwritten.\\\\n51. To make the output, you have to fill down each column of the grid with the highest colored square.  If a column is fully black or already filled, leave the column as it is. If there\\\\\\'s only one colored cell in a column, copy that color to all the black cells below it in the same column. If there\\\\\\'s more than one colored cell in a column, copy the color of the highest colored cell to all the black cells below it in the same column.\\\\n52. To make the output, you have to determine the color of the squares in the top row and take that color down to the 2 rows below, replacing any other color already there. Keep the black squares in the same places.\\\\n53. To produce the output, you should start at the top row of the grid and then move vertically down column-by-column, filling in black cells with the color of the most recently encountered colored cell in the current column (if such a colored cell exists in the current column). For instance, if there is a green cell in the top row of the middle column in the input grid, then all the black cells below it in the same column in the output grid would become green (unless there is another colored cell lower down in the same column in the input grid).\\\\n54. To transform the grid, move the colors from cells in the first row to the right, filling black cells in the same column, keeping their original row. If the cell in the first row is black, it\\\\\\'s skipped.\\\\n55. To make the output, you have to fill the cells vertically down from the colored cells in the input grid. The filling stops when it hits another color or the edge of the grid.\\\\n56. To make the output, you have to fill the cells in each row with the color of the first non-black cell from the left of the same row. The color should spread towards the right.\\\\n57. To make the output, you have to identify the color square in the diagonal from top left to bottom right and fill the cells beneath it with the same color for each column.\\\\n58. To make the output, you have to fill in the leftmost blank cells (black cells) of each row with the color of the cell that is already present in that row. Essentially, the non-black cell color in each row spreads to the left.\\\\n59. To make the output, you have to carry the colors down towards the bottom of the grid, filling in empty cells along the way. This process can be visualized as dropping colored raindrops into the grid and watching them fill the empty spaces underneath them.\\\\n60. To make the output, you should copy the cell color from the first column to the empty cells of the following columns in the same row. That\\\\\\'s to say, the color of second and third cell in a row becomes same as the color of the first cell in that row.\\\\n61. To make the output, you have to fill the black cells with the available color in their respective columns upwards. The far left column gets filled upwards with the color from the bottom, the middle column gets filled upwards with the color from the middle cell, and the far right gets filled upwards with the color from the middle cell. The top cells do not get filled if there is no color in their respective column below them.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "After analyzing the rules, they can be categorized into eight distinct categories based on their similarities.

For each category, synthesize the rules into a single, specific rule that combines the ideas of all rules in that category, while clearly differentiating it from the other categories.\\\\nThe new rule should be as specific as possible, following the format of the given rules.\\\\nThe new rule should be applicable without any information from the original rules - i.e. it should be standalone.\\\\n\\\\nRules:\\\\n1. To transform the grid, we focus on diagonal line from the top-left to the bottom-right. This is where the number is formed by the teal cells. An empty cell in this line in the input becomes a teal cell in the output.  Meanwhile in the output-a diagonal from top-left to bottom-right, these teal cells come from empty cells in the corresponding positions in the input. Therefore, there is a 1-to-1 transformation from the empty cells in the input diagonals to the teal cells in the output diagonals. The rest cells in the output should all be black.\\\\n2. Each output cell represents several input cells. The top left cell of output grid represents the top left shape of the input, the cell to the right represents the shape to the right of the first shape. This pattern proceeds for each row of the output, representing the corresponding row of shapes in the input. If there is a shape in the position the output cell represents, that cell should be teal (8), if there isn\\\\\\'t it should be black (0).\\\\n3. To make the output, count the number of \\\\\\'T\\\\\\' shaped teal elements in the input grid. Then create a diagonal line of teal squares in the output grid that runs from the top-left to the bottom-right corners. The length of the diagonal line should be equal to the number of teal \\\\\\'T\\\\\\' shapes in the input. The rest of the output grid should be black.\\\\n4. To make the output, count the number of 4x4 diagonal line patterns in the input, and replicate these as single squares in the output grid, preserving their diagonal orientation. In essence, each 4x4 diagonal line is being reduced to a single square on a diagonal line, in the output grid. The bottom left square of the output should be teal. The diagonal made by the teal squares should run from the bottom left to the top right of the output grid, with the remainder of the grid remaining black.\\\\n5. To make the output, you have to identify, in order, each group of blue boxes in the input. Then, find the uppermost blue box in each group and color that square blue in the output grid. The order to identify the groups and the orientation of the output grid should correspond to the layout of the groups in the input. The first group becomes the uppermost square on the top left of the output, the second group maps to the square down and to the right of the first, and so on, with the final group represented by the furthest down and right square in the output.\\\\n6. To make the output, you need to map the location of each cluster in the input into the output grid. If there is a cluster of teals in the upper left corner of the input, then the corresponding cell in the output is teal (8). If there is no cluster in a certain position in the input, then the corresponding cell in the output is black (0). Each cluster in the input should correspond to a cell in the output.\\\\n7. To transform the input, you should identify the number of L-shaped block groups and then create n (the number of blocks in short side of the L-shaped block groups) by n grids in the output for each L-shape in the input. Position of each teal block in output corresponds to which quadrant of input it\\\\\\'s located (e.g. upper right becomes upper left in output, lower right becomes upper right in output).\\\\n8. The pattern can be described as following: \\\\\\'read\\\\\\' the cluster configuration from top left to bottom right of the input rows; mark a teal cell in the corresponding square of the output grid if the cluster rotates clockwise or anticlockwise, depending on which clusters are in the input grid. If there is no cluster in the corresponding tier of the input grid, leave the corresponding square in the output grid black.   For example, if the topmost cluster of the input grid is rotated clockwise to form the second one (like in case 0), put a teal square in the second position of the first row of the output grid. Continue this for all clusters in the input grid.\\\\n9. To make the output, you have to count the number of teal groups/circles in the input. This will give you the size of your output grid. Put teal in the diagonal line from top left to bottom right in a number matching the number of circles. The rest of the output will be filled with black squares/cells.\\\\n10. To make the output, you have to create a NxN matrix where each cell corresponds to a group of symbols in the input. The symbols are transformed into a diagonal line of symbols in the output from the top left to the bottom right with black empty cells filling in the rest. The position of the cell in the output corresponds to the order of the recognized symbol groups in the input. For example, the first recognized group occupies the first cell on the diagonal in the output, the second group occupies the second cell on the diagonal, and so on.\\\\n11. To make the output, you have to take the center rows of each teal figure and arrange them in a smaller grid. The teal line in the first figure represents the diagonal from the top left to the bottom right. In the second figure, it is a line down the center. And in the third, the line goes from the top right to the bottom left.\\\\n12. To make the output, you have to create a diagonal line of teal squares going from the upper left corner to the lower right corner, with the remaining of the squares being black. The length of the diagonal line (and thus the size of the output grid) is determined by the number of distinct figures seen in the input grid.\\\\n13. To create the Output grid from the Input grid, 1. Identify each standalone diagonal of teal pixels in the input. 2. For each standalone diagonal line, place a single teal pixel in the corresponding location on the output grid (thus illustrating the pattern in a minimalistic way). The output grid dimensions are determined by the number of standalone diagonal lines in the input.  For example, if there are three diagonal lines in a down-right direction in the input grid, then in the output grid represent each of them by a single square in the same down-right direction forming a 3x3 output grid. If there are two diagonal lines in a down-right direction in the input grid, then in the output grid represent each of them by a single square in the same down-right direction forming a 2x2 output grid, and so on.\\\\n14. To create the output, first find the longest streak of teal items in the grid. The formation of teal items are usually in the shape of an arrow pointing towards a direction. Translate this streak into the output grid by creating a diagonal line of teal squares with the size according to the longest streak of teal items in the input. The rest of the squares in the output grid should be left as black squares.\\\\n15. Transform the input into the output by counting the number of teal shapes in the input, and use it to create a grid of this size. Then, fill the diagonal from top left to bottom-right with teal color, the rest of the cells are black.\\\\n16. To make the output, recreate the diagonal pattern found in each group of teal cells of the input in the cells of the output grid. Essentially, it\\\\\\'s like each group of teal cells in the input is miniaturized and mapped onto a single cell in the output. The top-left corner of the output corresponds to the first (top-most) group in the input, the middle to the middle group, and so on following a left-to-right, top-to-bottom order.\\\\n17. To make the output, you have to identify each \"L\" shape made of teal in the input grid. The size of the \"L\" shape, in terms of number of squares making up the vertical or horizontal arm, determines the dimensions of the output grid. Translate each \"L\" into a diagonal line of 8\\\\\\'s in the output by placing 8\\\\\\'s diagonally from the top left to the bottom right for the number of squares in the vertical and horizontal arm. The output is a square grid, whose size is equal to the length of the arm of the \"L\" shapes in the input grid. The 8\\\\\\'s are placed in diagonal line from the top left to the bottom right.\\\\n18. To make the output, you have to locate the bottom-left cell of every non-black shape in the input. Note a shape may be comprised of \"8\"s that are separated by black cells but sharing the same row or column. The square grid in the output will have a side length equal to the number of shapes observed in the input. Starting from the top-left cell and diagonally fill in a \"8\" for each shape observed in the input, moving towards the bottom-right cell. For cells not filled with \"8\", fill with a \"0\".\\\\n19. The transformation involves capturing the diagonal pattern of the input grid where teal squares border each other or the edge of the larger shape, regardless of their size. Depending on the size of the teal shapes that edge the larger rectangle, the output grid will have the corresponding number of cells per row/column, each reflecting the direction of the original teal border in the smaller size. All other cells are left blank (black, 0).\\\\n20. To transform the grid, you first need to count the number of distinct square shapes made of 8 (teal) in the input. Then, create a diagonal from top left to bottom right with exactly that number of 8s. Fill the rest of the grid with 0s.\\\\n21. To make the output, you have to create a square grid and fill the blocks along the main diagonal - from the top left to the bottom right corner - with teal. The rest of the grid should be filled with black.\\\\n22. To make the output, look for the teal squares in the input. There should be a blank line horizontally and vertically between them. Make a grid of the same dimensions as the number of teal squares. In the resulting grid, put a teal square at the position equivalent to the position of the square in the input grid. The reference position for the equivalent position is the top-left square of each teal square in the input. Fill the rest of the grid with black.\\\\n23. To make the output, you have to take the diamond shape from the input and rotate it 45 degrees counterclockwise. After rotation, the diamond should turn into a square shape with the length of the side equal to the length of the diagonal of the diamond in the input. The square should be colored teal (represented with the number 8) and placed on a black background.\\\\n24. To make the output, you have to identify diagonal lines or stripes in the figures with teal color. The size of the output grid corresponds to the number of these diagonal stripes. If the diagonal stripe is moving from top left to bottom right, color the corresponding cell in the output grid as teal. All other cells in the output grid should be left black.\\\\n25. To make the output, you have to replicate the teal shapes in a more condensed form. Each shape is simplified into a two-by-two grid. The teal cell in the output appears in the same relative position within the two-by-two grid as the cluster of teal cells occupy in the much larger quadrant of the black input hash.\\\\n26. To form the output, identify every distinct shape (connected group of teal cells) in the input grid. Transpose each shape as a teal cell in a new grid. Place the teal cells to form a diagnol starting from the top-left corner to the bottom-right. Fill the rest of the output grid with black cells.\\\\n27. To make the output, you have to count the number of teal figures in the input. The output grid is a diagonal line of teal from top left to bottom right, where its size is equal to the number of teal figures in the input. All other cells in the output grid are black.\\\\n28. To make the output, for each quadilateral figure formed by teal-colored cells in the input grid, create a diagonal line of teal-colored cells in the output grid. Each teal cell in the diagonal line of the output grid corresponds to a quadrilateral figure in the input grid. Start from the top-left corner and progress towards the bottom-right corner in a step by step manner along the diagonal. Fill the remaining part of the output grid with black cells.  It\\\\\\'s important to note that the position of the quadrilateral figures in the input grid and the number of teal cells does not affect the position or number of teal cells in the output grid.\\\\n29. To make the output, you have to locate the position each of the teal triangles, and place each in a distinct quadrant of the output according to the quadrant it is located in the input. This is based on a 2x2 matrix with one teal corner pixel in the row and column it appears in the input quadrant. If a triangle appears in multiple quadrants, we take the upper-leftmost one.\\\\n30. To make the output, you have to count the number of teal shapes in the input grid. For each teal shape on the input grid, create a column in the output grid. The column should be filled with black cells except the diagonal which should be populated with teal cells starting from the top-left corner towards the bottom-right corner.\\\\n31. To make the output, you have to create a diamond pattern with teal squares as per the number of triangles in the input. If it\\\\\\'s 3 triangles, create 3 squared cross; if it\\\\\\'s 2 triangles, 2 squared cross. For these diamonds, start from the top left and place the teal color to the right in a 45-degree diagonal motion. Place black squares elsewhere.\\\\n32. To create the output, you need to map each distinct shape in the input to a single cell in the output grid. This cell should be positioned in the equivalent row and column as the shape\\\\\\'s locale in the input. If the shape is made up of \\\\\\'8\\\\\\'s, then the cell in the output grid should contain an \\\\\\'8\\\\\\'. If there is no distinct shape in a certain row-column pairing in the input, the equivalent cell in the output should be \\\\\\'0\\\\\\'.\\\\n33. To make the output, you have to divide the grid into four equal squares. For each square, count the teal color that is not on the edge of that square. In each quarter of the output, place a teal square in a position corresponding to the position of the counted teal square in the input.\\\\n34. Both the input and output maintain a diagonal teal color. The transformation condenses the larger shape in the input to a single cell in the output, where the single cell in the output corresponds to the position of the shape in the quadrant of the larger grid. For example, in a 3x3 output grid and three \\\\\\'greater than\\\\\\' arrow shapes in the input - one each in the top-right, middle, and bottom-left quadrants of the input, count the quadrants starting from the top-left in a clockwise direction - the output would have the teal cell in the top-right, middle, and bottom-left of the output grid.\\\\n35. To make the output, start by dividing the grid into quarters (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right). Following diagonal line from the top-left to the bottom-right corner of each quarter. If a quarter contains at least one color teal (Number 8), it is represented by teal in the transformed grid. So, in the final grid, squares represents the color information of the corresponding quarters in the input grid. So the top-left square of output grid corresponds to the top-left quarter of the input grid, and so on. The squares in the output grid follow a diagonal arrangement, starting from the top-left corner to the bottom-right. If a quarter in the input grid does not contain a color teal, it is represented by black in the transformed grid.   In addition, if there is an arrangement of teal squares forming an approximate diagonal line in a quarter of the input grid, then the corresponding quarter in the output will also have a teal square. This transformation seems to give priority to the diagonal arrangements of teal squares in the input grid.\\\\n36. To make the output grid, identify each figure in the input and represent each figure as a teal point in the output. Place the points in the output in the same relative positions to each other as their corresponding figures are in the input. If there is no figure in a position in the input, leave that position black in the output.\\\\n37. To make the output grid, each \\\\\\'8\\\\\\' block in the input represents a cell in the output. The position of this cell in the output is relative to the other blocks\\\\\\' position. The amount of \\\\\\'8\\\\\\'s in each block does not affect this translation. The first block would correspond to a top left cell filled with \\\\\\'8\\\\\\' in the output grid, the second to its bottom-right, and so on following a diagonal pattern. If no \\\\\\'8\\\\\\' block is found for a particular cell in the output grid, a \\\\\\'0\\\\\\' should be filled in.\\\\n38. To create the output grid, identify how many teal squares groups there are in the input. In each group, note the position of the single square relative to the rest. In the output, create a teal square in the corresponding position for a grid that\\\\\\'s as large as the number of groups. Consequently, if there are four groups, the output grid is 4 x 4, with each group\\\\\\'s \"individual\" square position marked in teal and the other squares black. If there are three groups, it\\\\\\'s a 3 x 3 grid, and if two, it\\\\\\'s a 2 x 2 grid.\\\\n39. To make the output, you have to count the number of teal diagonal lines in each quadrant and create a grid of equivalent size (i.e., if there are four teal diagonals in each quadrant in the input, the output will be a 4x4 grid). In the new grid, place a teal square at the intersection of each row and column number equivalent to the position of the teal diagonal line in the input quadrant. All other squares in the grid should remain black.\\\\n40. The transformation involves trying to spot the \\\\\\'L\\\\\\' shapes made up by the teal (number 8) cells in each quadrant of the grid. If there\\\\\\'s an \\\\\\'L\\\\\\' in the quadrant, then the corresponding cell in the output grid will be teal (number 8). If there\\\\\\'s no \\\\\\'L\\\\\\' shape, the corresponding cell in the output grid will be black (number 0). Each quadrant of the input grid corresponds to a cell in the output grid, creating a miniature representation of the overall pattern.\\\\n41. To make the output, you need to identify each separate teal pattern in the grid and translate that into a new location in a decreased new grid. The process can be described as follows: Establish a separate grid for each colored pattern, keeping the original grid size. From here, normalize the size of each grid to the smallest bounding size that can cover the colored shape. Then merge all these created representations into one final output. The output grid should be a diagonal line in teal from the top left to bottom right based on the number and type of shapes in the input. The remaining squares should be black.\\\\n42. Each shape is ultimately transformed into a small NxN grid where only one cell is colored, corresponding to the nth position of the shape in the original grid (with counting starting from the topmost row, from left to right). The rest of the cells remain black. All these small grids are combined into one, each occupying an area in the big picture from top to bottom as in the original grid.\\\\n43. To make the output, you have to count the number of unique teal patterns, then arrange the resulting teal cells from top-left to bottom-right in a diagonal line in the grid. Each unique pattern is represented by a teal cell and all beside cells are black.\\\\n44. The transformation rule is to denote each cluster as one teal cell in the output. The cells are arranged diagonally starting from the top left corner of the output grid down to the bottom right corner, with the sequence ordering determined by the appearance of the clusters from left to right and top to bottom in the input grid. The rest of the cells in the output grid are black cells.\\\\n45. To make the output, four instances of a pattern containing two teal cells on a diagonal, arranged in a square, are located on the input grid where a cell that is part of one pattern instance cannot be part of another. Each pattern instance on the input grid corresponds to a single teal cell in the output grid at an analogous position as the pattern on the input grid.\\\\n46. To make the output, you have to look at each section in the input grid and convert each picture into a single cell in the output grid. The first section corresponds to the upper left cell in the output grid, and so on, moving to the right and then down to the next line. If a section contains a colored square in the middle of black cells, map it to a colored cell in the output grid. If not, map it to a black cell in the output grid.\\\\n47. To make the output, divide the larger grid into \"quadrants\". For each quadrant, if there is an 8 (teal) in the center of the quadrant, put an 8 (teal) in the corresponding place in the output grid. If there is no teal in the center of the quadrant, place a 0 (black) in the corresponding place in the output grid.\\\\n48. To make the output, count the number of symbols in the input and create a square of the found count X count filled with black. Now take the symbols in the order they appear in the input grid from top to bottom and left to right and fill the diagonal of the square with the symbol starting from the top left corner down to the bottom right.\\\\n49. To create the output, count the number of these \"pyramid\" shapes in the input. The output should have a diagonal line of teal boxes with length same as the number of \"pyramids\" from the top left to the bottom right of the grid. The rest of the squares in the grid should be black. The positioning and shape of the teal \"pyramids\" in the input do not affect the output.\\\\n50. If there is a teal shape in the top left of the input, you can to put a teal cell in the top left of the output. The same applies for the top right, bottom left and bottom right corners. Hence, place a teal cell on the output grid in the same position as the placement of teal colored shapes in the input grid. If there are no teal shapes at one of the four corners of the input grid, do not place a teal cell there in the output. Fill the gaps between the teal cells in the output grid with black(empty) cells.\\\\n51. To make the output, you have to identify clusters of teal squares that form larger squares or rectangles. The size of these clusters, as long as they form a square or rectangle, represents the larger square in the output. The placement of the clusters in the input corresponds to the placement of the larger squares in the output. More specifically, top left cluster in the input corresponds to the top left cell in the output, and the same goes for other placements like top right, bottom left, and bottom right.\\\\n52. For each \"L\" shape in the input, place a teal square at a corresponding location in the output. Start from the upper left, and move down each row one by one till the end, leaving one square space between each square. For each row after the first, start one square to the right of the starting position of the previous row. Every row should move one step diagonally from left to right.\\\\n53. To make the output, you have to identify the number of separate teal groupings in the input. Create a diagonal in your output grid with the number of cells equivalent to the number of groups. Fill the cells on the diagonal from the top left to the bottom right with teal and fill the remaining cells with black.\\\\n54. To make the output, count the number of teal triangles in the input grid. Then create a new grid where the size is the number of triangles and fill it with a teal diagonal from the top left to the bottom right, the rest of the squares should be black.\\\\n55. First you need to count how many of these digit 8 shapes are on the grid. Next, create a square grid where the side of the square is equal to the quantity of the \\\\\\'8 shape\\\\\\'. Starting from the top left field, fill in diagonal boxes with teal, starting from the top left corner towards bottom right, rest should remain black. Thus, tracing a diagonal on the matrix.\\\\n56. To make the output, draw a teal diagonal line from the top left corner to the bottom right on a black canvas based on the number of teal-colored shapes in the input.\\\\n57. To make the output, you first identify the layout of teal squares on the grid. They should form an \"8\"-like shape. After identifying these shapes, create a new grid that has a size equal to the number of these shapes. In this new grid, fill in the diagonal from top left to bottom right with the teal color. Leave all other squares black.\\\\n58. To construct the output, effectively \\\\\\'crop\\\\\\' the grid down to the smallest size that captures all the sequences of consecutive teal dots, such that the final output is a diagonal line of teal dots from the top-left corner to the bottom-right. Fill all other cells in this grid with black colour. So if your stairs was \"n steps\" high, its corresponding output will be an \"n by n\" grid, with a diagonal line of teal dots sloping from the top left to bottom right and all other squares remaining black.\\\\n59. To generate the output grid, identify each teal triangle. Then, place a single teal square representing each triangle in a diagonal format starting from the top left corner and ending at the bottom right corner on the output grid. Remaining cells should remain black.\\\\n60. The task is about creating a diagonal grid of teal colored squares. If a diagonal on the input grid from the top-left to the bottom-right contains teal color at any position, then it should be represented on the output grid with the same teal color. The grid should always start with the teal color on the top left corner and end with the teal color in the right bottom corner.\\\\n61. To make the output, you need to follow the steps of the shape that are filled. Starting with the most outer step that is filled, map it to the left top to right bottom diagonal of the output matrix by placing them from top left to bottom right, leaving all other places as black. The output follows a top left to bottom diagonal with the teal color. The rest stays black.\\\\n62. To make the output, you have to consolidate each configuration in the input to a single teal cell, positioned in a new grid according to the relative layout of configurations in the input. Each teal cell in a configuration contributes to forming a diagonal line of the same color in the output grid. Each configuration manifests as a single cell in the new grid, and all configurations are ordered diagonally from the left top corner.\\\\n63. To make the output, start from the upper left corner and follow a diagonal pathway to the lower right corner. For each square in the input, add a teal square to this diagonal in the output. This means that the first input square corresponds to the first square in the diagonal of output, the second input square corresponds to the second square in the diagonal of the output and so on. All other cells are black.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "Based on the similarities in the rules, they can be categorized into eight distinct categories as follows:\n\nCategory 1: Rules that involve counting the number of specific shapes or patterns in the input and creating a diagonal line in the output of the same length.

For each category, synthesize the rules into a single, specific rule that combines the ideas of all rules in that category, while clearly differentiating it from the other categories.\\\\nThe new rule should be as specific as possible, following the format of the given rules.\\\\nThe new rule should be applicable without any information from the original rules - i.e. it should be standalone.\\\\n\\\\nRules:\\\\n1. To make the output, you have to transfer the grey blocks to the output. However, if a row contains more than half of the cells at the end of the rows (i.e., from the cell at the 7th column to the cell at the 10th column) being grey, color them with red in the output. If a row contains more than one grey block at the first four cells (i.e., from the cell at the 1st column to the cell at the 4th column), color them blue in the output. If a row does not meet the conditions above, color the grey blocks with green.\\\\n2. To create the output, each grouping of gray cells in the input is identified. Each grouping should have 5 or fewer cells. These groupings are then converted into different colors based on their orientation in the input grid. If the grouping of cells is oriented horizontally, they are changed to blue. If the group of cells is oriented vertically, they are changed to red, and if the grouping of cells are not rotated either horizontally or vertically, the cells are changed to brown. Cells that do not belong to any group remain black.\\\\n3. To make the output, you have to assign different colors according to the position of the gray blocks in the input.  The blocks in the upper left quarter should turn blue. The blocks in the upper right quarter should turn red.  The blocks in the lower left quarter should turn blue. The blocks in the lower right quarter should turn red. If the row or column of the block is equal to or higher than 5, it should be blue, otherwise it should be red. And if a block lies on the vertical or horizontal median, it should change color from its original.\\\\n4. To make the output, you have to replace the grey shapes based on their placement on the grid. Replace the shapes on the top left with blue, shapes on the top right with red, shapes on the bottom left with blue and shapes on the bottom right with red.\\\\n5. To make the output, you have to replace the grey colour on the grid. The horizontal lines should turn red and the \\\\\\'L\\\\\\' shape should turn blue. If there is a pixel that belongs to both shapes, it should be replaced by blue. All the excluded area which was previously in black should remain black.\\\\n6. To make the output, you have to change the color of the elements based on their positions. If the grey object is at the top or bordering the top side of the grid, make it blue. If it is at the right or bordering the right side, make it red. If both conditions do not apply, make it green. The black cells remain the same.\\\\n7. To generate the output grid from the input, you must analyze the pattern of grey cells. If the grey cell is in the top 50% and the far left or far right 33.33% of the grid, turn it blue. If it\\\\\\'s in the bottom 50% and the far left or far right 33.33% of the grid, turn it red. If it\\\\\\'s in the center 33.33% horizontally, turn it orange.\\\\n8. The transformation of the grid involves colour changes based on their orientation within the grid.   1. The central block of 2x3 gray cells in the input grid turns into blue (value 1) in the output grid; 2. The block of 2x3 gray cells positioned at the top or to the left (relative to the grid\\\\\\'s center) in the input grid turns into red (value 2) in the output grid; 3. The block of 2x3 gray cells positioned at the bottom or to the right (relative to the grid\\\\\\'s center) in the input grid as well as the additional vertical or horizontal strip remain gray. All remaining cells that were black in the input grid, stay black in the output grid.\\\\n9. To transform the input into the output, the gray squares are changed to either blue or red squares depending on their arrangement or pattern. One group of the gray squares connected in a row or column changes to blue. If the group of gray squares creates a sort of symmetry (either forming a sort of diagonal or parallel), they change to red.\\\\n10. The transformation involves changing the colors based on their shape. If the colored 3x3 squares are horizontally aligned, it is transformed into a blue color. If the colored 3x3 squares form a \"T\" shape, it is transformed into a red color. If the colored 3x3 squares form a \"Z\" shape, it is transformed into a green color.\\\\n11. To form the output, for every region of grey dots in the input grid, if It\\\\\\'s in top left corner, replace them with red dots. If it\\\\\\'s in the top right corner, replace them with blue dots. If it\\\\\\'s in the bottom left corner or on the far right column, replace them with green dots. The black empty cells in the input remain the same in the output.\\\\n12. To make the output, you have to replace each gray square depending on its spatial location within the grid. If the gray square is found on an edge or a corner (i.e., it shares at least one side with the grid\\\\\\'s border), replace it with a red square. If the gray square is located in the middle section of the grid but is not surrounded by other gray squares on all sides, replace it with a blue square. Otherwise, replace it with a green square. Any black square should remain black.\\\\n13. To make the output, you have to identify three types of shapes in the grid: the first type is a square shape, the second type is an \u201cL\u201d shaped, and the third type is a strip that\\\\\\'s one cell wide. After identifying the shapes, replace the squares with red (2), the \u201cL\u201d shaped ones with blue (1) and the strips with black (0). Retain the black (empty) cells as is.\\\\n14. To make the output, you have to observe the digit 5 drawing in the input grid. Replace grey cells (5s) with blue (1s) if these cells are in the top half of the grid. Alternatively, if these cells are in the bottom half of the grid, replace them with red (2s). The division is horizontal and across the middle row of the grid, which means the top 5 rows and bottom 5 rows. Black cells (0s) remain unchanged.\\\\n15. The top-left quad of colored cells in the input grid changes to blue in the output grid. The cells in the top-right quad changes to red. The cells in the bottom-left quad changes to blue and the ones in the bottom-right quad transforms to red. The grey cells in the input grid are colorized based on their quadrant. To visually split the grid into quads, imagine a cross splitting the grid into four equal parts. Each quad transforms a certain color to a different one.\\\\n16. To make the output, you have to transform the color of the cells according to the following rule:   - If the grey cell is in the highest row or in the lowest row of the shape, transform it into blue (1).  - If the grey cell is in the rightmost column or in the leftmost column of the shape (not already colored blue), transform it into red (2).  - If the grey cell is in the middle of the shape (not already colored blue or red), transform it into green (3).  - Keep all white cell intact which are represented by a zero in the grid.   The \"shape\" mentioned in the rules is defined by the boundary made up of grey cells. This means excluding all the zero (white) cells around the shape.\\\\n17. To make the output, the transformation rule is linked to the orientation of the shapes in the input grid. Depending on the position of the grey shape, replace the grey cells with different colored cells. If the grey shape is at the top of the grid, replace the grey cells with blue (number 1). If the shape is in the middle, replace grey cells with red (number 2). If the shape is at the bottom, replace the grey cells with orange (number 3). For any unclear cases, like if the grey shape is touching more than one side of the grid, go with the one that covers the most boundary. All the other cells that are not grey in the input should remain black (number 0) in the output.\\\\n18. To make the output, you have to count the number of tiles in each grey cluster and then color the tiles in that cluster accordingly. If the cluster contained two tiles, color them red (represented by the number two); if three, color them green (represented number one). The black spaces (zeros) are unchanged in the transformation.\\\\n19. To make the output, you have to perform the following steps -  1) Maintain a counter of grey cells from left to right 2) If the counter is equal to one then make the grey cells Red 3) If the counter is equal to Two then make the grey cells Green 4) If the counter is equal to Three then reset the counter to zero 5) Ignore black cells  This pattern is continued for each line from the top to the bottom of the grid.\\\\n20. To form the output grid, locate every grey colored shape in the grid. These grey shapes take many different forms but they are always a continuous group of cells.   For each continuous grey shape in the input, color it differently based on its geometry in the output:  - If it has a straight vertical or horizontal line segment with a minimum length of 3 in it, color it red (represented by the number 2).  - If it doesn\u2019t have a straight vertical or horizontal line segment with a minimum length of 3 in it, instead it has a continuous diagonal line segment with a minimum length of 3 in it, color it blue(represented by the number 1).  All other cells remain black (represented by the number 0).\\\\n21. To make the output, you have to follow the pattern of the grey box from left to right. Then, look down to the next line and repeat the same pattern. Every third row of grey (from top to bottom) stays the same but changes to red in the output. Every other row that begins with a grey box on the left edge of the grid changes to blue in the output. If a row begins with a grey box not on the outer edge of the grid, it changes to green in the output.\\\\n22. To make the output, you have to follow these steps: 1. You need to divide the input grid into nine small squares of 3x3, each square\\\\\\'s coordinates are: Top left: (0,0) - (2,2),  Top middle: (0,3) - (2,6),  Top right: (0,7) - (2,9),  Middle left: (3,0) - (5,2),  Middle: (3,3) - (5,6),  Middle right: (3,7) - (5,9),  Bottom left: (6,0) - (8,2),  Bottom middle: (6,3) - (8,6),  Bottom right: (6,7) - (8, 9). 2. Count the number of grey boxes in each of the nine 3x3 small squares. Now this small square will become a box in a 3x3 output grid. If there\\\\\\'re 0-3 grey boxes in the small square, its corresponding output box should be black. If there\\\\\\'re 4-5 grey boxes, it should be blue.\\\\n23. To form the output, the input grid is divided into three equal horizontal sections (top, middle, bottom). The grey cells in the top section are turned to blue (1), the middle section to red (2), and the bottom section gets to keep the grey color, in the output. Black spaces (0) remain same across all sections.\\\\n24. To make the output, you have to observe the occurrence of the grey squares. Start your counting from top to bottom, left to right. For the first occurrence of the grey squares, change it to blue. For the second occurrence, change it to red. For the third occurrence, you ignore it and do not change the color. Repeat this process until the end.\\\\n25. To make the output, you have to first detect the orientation of the gray clusters that are more than 2 cells wide. If the gray cluster is more horizontal than vertical, replace the cells with red cells. If the gray cluster is more vertical than horizontal, replace the cells with blue. Then, replace remaining single or double gray cells with red and blue alternately row by row starting with a blue cell.\\\\n26. 1. Start with an equivalent grid, all black. 2. Find the first non-black cell in the input grid by reading the rows from the top (row 1) to the bottom (row 10), and within each row, reading cells from left to right (column 1 to column 10). Color the first non-black cell in the output grid red. 3. Continue reading the cells in the input grid. For every consecutive non-black cell, color the equivalent output cell red, until you find a black cell, a cell on a new row, or a cell on a new column. 4. After a sequence of consecutive non-black cells is interrupted, color the next non-black cell blue. 5. Continue step 3. and 4. until every cell in the input grid has been read.  In essence, every continuous line of grey cells (without interruptions by black cells, row changes, or column changes) alternates color between red (color 2) and blue (color 1) in the output.\\\\n27. In the output, the transformation rule changes the grey shapes on the input grid: if the grey shape is on the top left quadrant, it becomes red (2), if it is on the top right quadrant, it keeps being grey (5), if it is on the bottom left quadrant, it becomes blue (1), and if it is on the bottom right quadrant, it becomes black (0). This rule applies considering the whole 10x10 grid divided into quadrants regardless of the initial position of the shape in the input. For example, if a small shape is near the center, it will be categorized according to which quadrant it falls. Each quadrant is a 5x5 grid: top-left from 0 to 4 lines and columns, top-right from 0 to 4 lines and from 5 to 9 columns, bottom-left from 5 to 9 lines and 0 to 4 columns, and bottom-right from 5 to 9 lines and columns.\\\\n28. To make the output, each grey shape needs to be transformed into a different color. The shape located on the top-left corner will be colored red, the top-right corner shape will be colored green, the bottom-left shape will be colored blue, and the bottom-right shape will be colored fuchsia. The large shape in the center will be colored yellow.\\\\n29. To make the output, you have to transform each part of the grey shape in order depending on its position from top to bottom. Starting from top, replace with blue for the first shape, red for the second shape, and so on.\\\\n30. To make the output, you have to replace the grey colors with red and blue colors depending on their conditional placements on grid. It should follow following pattern: shapes in the left top third (before approximately the point (0, 6)) should be colored red, shapes in the right top third (after approximately point (0, 6)) should be colored blue, and other positions should keep the original color.\\\\n31. To create the output, you need to consider the positioning of the gray shapes in the input grid. You will be converting these gray shapes to either red or blue. The rule is: if a gray square is at the top half of the grid, convert it to red; if it is at the bottom half, convert it to blue. However, for squares that appear on the middle line, convert the left half of them to red and the right half to blue.\\\\n32. To make the output, you should identify the grey figures and break them down into three categories. The first category represents a horizontal line figure, the second category represents a vertical line figure, and the third category represents a corner/angle-like figure. The first category\\\\\\'s grey figure should be converted into red, the second into blue, and the third into orange. All other squares remain black.\\\\n33. To make the output, you have to change the color of the cells as per the following steps: 1. The gray dot in the input grid transforms into a red dot with a new value of 2 in the output grid. 2. The gray vertical line in the input grid transforms into a green vertical line with a new value of 1 in the output grid. 3. The gray horizontal line in the input grid transforms into the blue horizontal line with a new value of 3 in the output grid.\\\\n34. To make the output, you have to count the number of grey cells in each shape. The shape consisting of the largest number of grey cells is colored red in the output, while the shape consisting of the second largest number of grey cells is colored blue in the output. The smallest shape consisting of the fewest grey cells remains grey.\\\\n35. To make the output, you have to look at the groups of grey cells. If a group is at the right edge of the grid, turn them into red. If it\\\\\\'s at the top edge of the grid, turn them into blue. If it\\\\\\'s at the left edge of the grid, turn them into teal. If it\\\\\\'s in the middle area of the grid, keep them as grey. All other cells should remain black.\\\\n36. The transformation rule focuses on counting the number of five-colored blocks in each row. If there are 2 blocks, replace them with red and others remain black. If they are 3 blocks, replace them with blue. If there are greater than 3 blocks, replace them with orange.  This rule reads the blocks from right to left. So the first block from the right that matches the condition will be replaced with the designated color and the blocks to its left in the same row will stay as they are.\\\\n37. Count the number of blue squares in each 3x3 grid. If there are 3 blue squares in a sub-grid, replace the blue border squares with dark red and the center one with light red. If there are 4 blue squares in a sub-grid, replace the blue squares with dark red squares. If there are 5 blue squares in a 3x3 sub-grid, replace them with light red squares and the remaining squares without borders remains the same.\\\\n38. To transform the grid, identify the positions of the letter \"5\". If it is in the first three columns of the grid, change the \"5\" to \"2\". If it is in the last three columns, change \"5\" to \"1\". If it is elsewhere (i.e., the 4th to the 7th column), change \"5\" to \"0\". Turn all unmatched positions (previously \"0\") into \"0\" as well. This process mimics a three-zone categorization of the grid, with each zone getting its own designated number.\\\\n39. To make the output, you have to perform three types of transformations. The first type of transformation is the base transformation: black space remains unchanged, and the grey pixels are transformed into blue (2). The second type of transformation, or special transformation rule one, states that if the grey pixel column has more than 2 consecutive grey pixels, those pixels are transformed into red (1). The third transformation rule: for each row, if there is grey format going from top left to bottom right diagonally, transform those pixels into orange (3). Notably, the special transformation rules have to be checked and executed first before applying the base transformation.\\\\n40. To make the output, you mainly count the number of blocks in each discrete figure. Discrete figures with 3 blocks are colored red. Those with 4 blocks are colored blue and those with 5 or more blocks are colored green. All other blocks (those that are not part of a discrete figure or a discrete figure comprising of fewer than 3 blocks) should remain black.   In summary, you turn all blocks of figures that comprise 3 blocks into red, 4 blocks into blue, and 5 blocks or more into green.\\\\n41. To make the output, you have to convert the grey clusters into different colors based on their locations on the grid. If a grey cluster is located on the left side of the grid, it should be changed to blue. If a grey cluster is located on the right side, it should change to red. If the grey cluster spans both left and right halves of the grid, its color should be green. All the black cells should be kept as they are.\\\\n42. To make the output, you have to apply the following color transformations: - Change the grey horizontal lines to red. - Change the grey vertical lines to blue. - Change the grey squares to green.  Note: A line is seen as horizontal if its slope is 0 when viewed from left to right. Similarly, a line is seen as vertical if its slope is either positive or negative infinity when viewed from top to down. While, a square is seen as a set of numbers in form of a square.\\\\n43. The transformation consists of recoloring the following shapes:  1. For each shape that contains only one row (for example: only a horizontal strip/line regardless of its length), transform all grey cells to blue.  2. For each shape that contains two rows (for example: two horizontal strips/line adjacent to each other), transform all grey cells into red.  3. For shapes that contain more than two rows, transform all grey cells to green.\\\\n44. To make the output, the coloured blocks need to change based on their respective rows. From top to bottom, for the first three rows encountered with colored boxes, change the colour to red. In the following three, change it to blue. Repeat this pattern throughout the grid. Empty cells remain the same.\\\\n45. To make the output, you have to look at each \"grey\" number in the input grid. If this \"grey\" number is forming the pattern of the letter \"E\", then replace it with a \"blue\" number. If this \"grey\" number is forming the pattern of the letter \"C\", then replace it with a \"red\" number. If this \"grey\" number is forming the pattern of the letter \"F\", then replace it with a \"green\" number. Always keep the black background the same.\\\\n46. To make the output, you have to replace the gray blocks with the colors as per the following conditions - 1. If the element is surrounded horizontally or vertically by black color, it becomes blue. 2. If the element is adjacent to another gray block both vertically and horizontally, it becomes red. 3. For the remaining gray blocks, turn them into green. The term \"remaining\" refers to those gray blocks that do not meet the conditions for blue or red, such as isolated blocks or those that are only surrounded on diagonal corners.\\\\n47. To make the output, the rule seems to be that areas with 3 or more contiguous grey cells diagonally or straight turn into a red (2) pattern. Areas with fewer than three turn into a blue (1) pattern. Lines of grey that are only two long either horizontally or vertically are outlined with red between the leftmost and rightmost points.\\\\n48. To make the output, you have to change the color from grey to another color depending on the shape the grey cells form, if they form a number 1, change them to blue, if they form a number 2, change them to red, if they form a number 3, change them to green. The rest of the cells remain black as in the input grid.\\\\n49. To make the output, you have to look at the location of the grey cell pattern. If it\\\\\\'s in the upper left corner, change the grey cells to red. If the pattern is on the right side (either entirely or partially), change the grey cells to blue. If the pattern is along the bottom, change the grey cells to green. If the pattern is elsewhere, change the grey cells to yellow.\\\\n50. To get the output, you have to change all the grey (5) squares into blue (1) or red (2) according to their orientation.  For the first and third cases, the pattern is: for a horizontal line of grey squares convert them into blue, for a vertical line of grey squares convert them into red, and for an individual grey square, convert it into blue. For the second case, the pattern is: for a vertical line of grey squares convert it into blue, for a horizontal line of grey squares convert them into red, and for an individual grey square, convert it into blue. The difference is regarding the orientation of the lines.\\\\n51. To make the output, you have to change the color of the grid\\\\\\'s input. If the grey cells (5s) from the input grid are at the top third part or at the middle third part of the grid, you have to paint them into blue (1s) on the output grid. If the grey cells are at the bottom third part of the grid, those cells should be painted into red (2s) on the output grid. The black cells remain black (0s) in the output grid.\\\\n52. To make the output, you look at each block of grey pixels in the input grid, and you replace the color of these blocks according to the following rules:   - If the block is in the top-left quarter of the grid, it is changed to blue.   - If the block is in the top-right quarter of the grid, it is changed to red.   - If the block is in the lower-left quarter of the grid, it is changed to blue.   - If the block is in the lower-right quarter of the grid, then it is changed to red. The position of the block is determined by the position of its center (average position of the grey pixels). The black pixels remain black.\\\\n53. To make the output, you have to identify the number represented by the shape of grey blocks in the input. Change every grey square to blue when it represents the number 1, red when it represents the number 2, and green when it represents the number 3. Maintain all other colors as they are. The position and shape of the grey blocks should not change.\\\\n54. It seems like there is a pattern to this, the grid is divided into three main parts: left third, middle third, and right third. In this case, if the grey block is in the right third of the grid, it changes to red in the output. If the grey block is in the middle third of the grid, it changes to blue in the output. If the grey block is in the left third, it changes to the color green. The black boxes remain black in the output.\\\\n55. To make the output, you have to switch the colors of the objects. If the grey color is on the left side of the black line (middle vertical), color it blue in the output. If it is on the right side of the black line, color it red. However, if the grey color is on the black line, color it grey in the output.\\\\n56. To make the output, you have to follow a transformation depending on the location of the grey colored shape in the input. If the shape is located in the top half of the grid, it\\\\\\'s replaced by red in the corresponding location in the output. If the shape is located in the bottom half of the grid, it\\\\\\'s replaced by blue in the corresponding location in the output. If the shape crosses the middle row of grid or lies on the middle row, it\\\\\\'s replaced by green in the corresponding location in the output.\\\\n57. The rule for transforming the input to output is by replacing the gray (5) color properties based on its position. If the gray cell is located to the right of the center line, it turns red (2). If it is to the left of the center line, it turns blue (1). If the gray cell lies exactly on the center line, keep it as gray (5).\\\\n58. To make the output, you have to change all the numbers in the form of 2, colored blocks to blue (1), and all the numbers in the form of 5, colored to red (2). Rest of the grids should remain same.\\\\n59. To make the output, you have to follow a specific pattern rule. Change a standalone part of grey cells in group to be red. If a grey cell part is located to the left of another gray cell part, change it to be blue. If a grey cell part is located to the right of another gray cell part, change it to be teal.\\\\n60. The transformation consists of changing the color ID from 5 to 1 of the grey spots with a right-side neighbor, from 5 to 2 if it has a neighbor on the left side, and from 5 to 1 if it has a neighbor on the top.\\\\n61. The pattern transformation involves the detection of closed or nearly closed grey (5) structures in the grid. If the structure is fully closed, all the cells of the structure in the output grid will be replaced with blue color (represented by 1). If the grey (5) structure has any cells connecting it to the boundary of the 10x10 matrix, all the cells of the structure in the output grid will be replaced with red color (represented by 2).\\\\n62. To perform the transformation, you need to change any gray area to orange that lies on the very left or right (they must touch the edge). For any gray block part of a line or zigzag pattern in the center, change it to red. For all other gray blocks, change them to blue.\\\\n63. The transformation involves a color changing, layout retaining process. The entire gray color area is divided into three sections: the top right, the bottom left, and the rest of the area. For the top right gray area, the color turns to red, for the bottom left gray area, the color becomes blue, and for the rest of the gray area, it changes to green. The black cells stay black.\\\\n64. To make the output, the transformation requires two steps:   1. Identify closely placed grey (coded with \"5\") squares and separate them into groups or clusters. This can be done using a clustering method that involves separating squares that are directly adjacent to each other (horizontal, vertical and diagonals).   2. Then assign these clusters with different colors. Assign the color red(coded with \"2\") in the output to the cluster that has the largest number of rectangles. Assign the color blue(coded with \"1\") to the rest of the clusters. All the other squares remain black (coded with \"0\") as in the input grid.   Note: If two or more clusters have the same maximum number of rectangles, assign the red color to either of them and the blue color to the others.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "Categories:\n\n1.

For each category, synthesize the rules into a single, specific rule that combines the ideas of all rules in that category, while clearly differentiating it from the other categories.\\\\nThe new rule should be as specific as possible, following the format of the given rules.\\\\nThe new rule should be applicable without any information from the original rules - i.e. it should be standalone.\\\\n\\\\nRules:\\\\n1. To make the output, you have to change all the black cells (number 0) inside the gray square to teal (represented by number 8). Additionally, add a \\\\\\'teal\\\\\\' line pointing downwards from the center of the bottom edge of the square.\\\\n2. To make the output, one should fill in the \\\\\\'empty\\\\\\' spaces inside the grey figure with teal. On top of that, a vertical teal line, starting from the top and stopping at the grey figure, should be created at the central column of the grid.\\\\n3. The transformation involves identifying the matching components of the \\\\\\'0\\\\\\' figure at the top and bottom. The top part of \\\\\\'0\\\\\\' is replicated in the bottom and the lower part of \\\\\\'0\\\\\\' in the top with a change of color from grey to teal (number eight). The original positions of the parts in \\\\\\'0\\\\\\' are filled with teal in the output.\\\\n4. To make the output, you have to transform the black square into a teal square and the grey towards the bottom (6 places) inside the grey square into teal but keep all the rest same.\\\\n5. To transform the grid from input to output, you need to invert the gray rectangle. But, the line of gray that falls in the center of the rectangle should be filled with teal color down to the bottom of the grid. Ultimately every black cell under the center of the flipped rectangle will turn teal.\\\\n6. To make the output, you have to modify the area within the grey shape. If the grey shape is completely closed, replace all the within the shape to a teal color. Then add a vertical line of teal dots in the middle column outside the shape. If the grey shape is not completely closed, do not modify the grey shape and only add a line of teal dots outside the shape.\\\\n7. To make the output, you have to insert a teal colored line in the middle of the grid, both vertically and horizontally. Then, convert all the interior of Grey shape (except the boundary line) into Teal color.\\\\n8. To make the output, you have to fill the inside of the \"C\" shape with teal color. Furthermore, there is a teal line that is perpendicular to the open side of the \"C\" shape. This line ends at the border of the \"C\" and extends to the edge of the grid. If the \"C\" shape is backwards, the line is towards the left, otherwise, it is towards the right.\\\\n9. To make the output, you make the area inside the square teal. Then,make a vertical line of the teal color in the middle of output grid, extending from the top of the square border until the bottom of it.\\\\n10. To make the output, the rule is to fill the inside of a box with teal when the box is a 6x6 or larger. If it\\\\\\'s smaller than 6x6, then place a teal stripe absolute middle row.\\\\n11. To make the output, you have to draw a teal line from the top to the bottom of the grey square\\\\\\'s center and then fill in the inside of the square with teal while leaving outlined grey square unchanged.\\\\n12. To get the output, you outline the grey rectangle (5) with a layer of teal (8) boxes. If the rectangle has a gap in one of its sides, that gap should be also filled with teal boxes. The rest of the grid remains black (0).\\\\n13. The transformation involves altering the grey square. The grey square remains the same, with the exception of empty interior spaces, now being filled with teal. In addition to this, outside the grey square towards \\\\\\'South\\\\\\', a vertical line of teal boxes is also created, descending from the center of the south side of the square to the bottom of the whole grid.\\\\n14. To create the output from the input, inside the grey rectangle, replace all the black cells with teal. For all the black cells below the rectangle, replace them with teal, until you hit a grey cell.\\\\n15. To form the output, you need to change the inner part of the grey rectangle to a teal color. The rectangle\\\\\\'s edges remain grey. In addition, also mark the row or column in the middle of the remaining blank space (black) to teal, lining up with the teal inside the grey box. If the entered grey rectangle is in the lower middle part of the grid, mark the row; if the rectangle is in the upper part, mark the column.\\\\n16. To make the output, you have to replace the cells inside the rectangle from black to teal. Then add a line of teal cells starting from the middle of the rectangle and moving vertically upwards until it hits the border of the grid. If there\\\\\\'s already a grey cell in the path, replace the grey cell with teal cell.\\\\n17. To make the output, wherever there are lighter (grey) colored cells in the input grid interior of the dark (grey) box, convert them into teal colored cells. The dark box retains the lighter color (grey). Then, add a vertical column of teal colored cells on the exterior of the dark box, splitting the middle of empty black space above and below the box.\\\\n18. To make the output, you have to fill the internal part of the square or rectangle with teal blocks, leaving the grey blocks and the rest of the grid intact. Then, create a line of teal blocks outside the square or rectangle extending from the center of it downwards. If there\\\\\\'s already a grey line there, replace it with teal blocks.\\\\n19. To create the output, the box in the middle should remain the same, but the black squares directly above and beneath the center of the grey box are replaced with brown squares. Additionally, the black squares within the grey box and characters beneath the brown square (with the same position of the brown square) should be replaced with teal squares.\\\\n20. To make the output, you have to fill the grey shape with teal, but the top and bottom sides of the shape (including corners) should remain grey. Then, five additional teal cells should be added to the center of the right column of the grid. These new teal cells should not intersect with the grey shape. If the grey shape is in the lower half of the grid, the teal cells should be added to the top. If the grey shape is in the upper half, the teal cells should be added to the bottom.\\\\n21. To make the output, you have to fill in the middle parts of the grey figure with teal color along with the middle row of the entire grid above and below the figure. If the figure intersects the middle line(s), fill the intersected part(s) of the figure with grey color. The remaining parts excluding the figure remain black.\\\\n22. To make the output, you have to replace the opening (empty space) in the \"A\" with teal color. After that, fill in a straight vertical line with teal color down the center of the grid, until it reaches the bottom of the \"A\", only coloring black cells and not covering any grey ones.\\\\n23. To make the output, a teal square inside the original grey square were filled in every directions except the top part. The top empty space becomes filled until the top border of the grid.\\\\n24. To make the output, you should fill the empty space within the \\\\\\'H\\\\\\' with teal cells (\\\\\\'8\\\\\\'). Then, add a vertical line of teal cells in the row exactly above the bar of the \\\\\\'H\\\\\\'. Finally, extend this vertical line of teal cells till it reaches the top of the grid.\\\\n25. To make the output, you should fill with teal color the inner empty (black) square or  rectangle, located inside the grey shape. An additional line of teal boxes should be added at the center line of the grid, if the space allows.\\\\n26. To make the output, you have to change all the grey cells inside the rectangle to teal. Notice that the two outermost layers of the rectangular shape remain grey. And if the rectangle is in the bottom half of the grid, you need to place a teal line in the shape of a cross at the top half of the grid. However, if the rectangle is in the top half of the grid, you need to place the cross at the bottom half of the grid.\\\\n27. To make the output, you have to fill the empty space within the grey square with teal. Create an additional teal line proportional to whether the grey square is in the top half or the bottom half of the grid. If the grey square is in the top half, draw the teal line in the bottom. If the grey square is in the bottom half, draw the teal line at the top.\\\\n28. To make the output, you have to take the gray square and place a smaller teal square inside of it. The teal square is always 1 rectangle away from the gray borders. The bottom two rows of the output grid are additionally marked with teal on black background, those two rows are where the grey square was touching the bottom border.\\\\n29. To form the output from the input grid, maintain all grey/5 cells in their position. Fill the empty/black cells inside the shape with teal/8. Also, there are teal/8 droplets falling from the top of the output grid until it hits the grey/5 shape or another teal/8 cell.\\\\n30. The transformation from input to output includes changing the colors of some blocks. Specifically, rotate the whole grid 180 degrees and also reflect it against the vertical axis in the middle. Then fill in either the top (for the letter \"H\") or the bottom (for the letter \"h\") with teal. If a letter \"H\" is rotated upside down, change all spaces within the bottom loop of the gray \"H\" with teal, maintaining the shape of the \u201cH\u201d. Conversely, if a letter \"h\" is rotated upside down, the spaces within the top loop of the grey \"h\" are filled with teal.\\\\n31. To make the output, you have to fill the hollow square with teal squares, and draw a vertical line of teal squares centrally positioned to the whole grid, from the top of the grid to the bottom of the grey cell.\\\\n32. To make the output, you have to modify the center of the plus figure (vertical and horizontal lines inside the figure) turning the grey cells to teal cells. Also, you should replace the consecutive top black cells from the first teal cell upwards with teal cells, until you reach the plus figure. This transformation creates a sort of \"pipe\" effect extending from the center of the plus shape in the vertical sense.\\\\n33. To make the output, perform the following steps: - Fill the inner part of the square (the part that was black in the input) with the color teal.  - Place a single stripe of the color teal extending upwards from the top side of the square to the upper edge of the grid. This stripe should be in line with the center of the top side of the square. If the square is placed lower in the grid, the stripe should be longer.\\\\n34. To transform the input grid into the output grid, identify the region within the grey rectangle where all four neighboring cells are black or on the grid border, then fill these cells with teal. You should also fill in any cells below this region with teal if and only if these cells are also black and have at least another black cell below them.\\\\n35. For the transformation, the key idea is to fill in the digit with teal, keep the border of the digit grey, and draw a vertical teal line in the middle of the grid from the top to the bottom of the digit. If the digit is \"0\", fill the inside of the digit as well. Black cells remain unchanged.\\\\n36. To make the output, fill in the hole of the gray square with the color teal. Also, draw a vertical line of teal squares in the center column of the grid.\\\\n37. To make the output, rotate the entire grid 90 degrees clockwise. After rotation, replace all the cells within the enclosed grey squares (except ones that form the boundary of the square) with teal color. After rotation, any grey cells that are now outside the square, convert them into teal as well.\\\\n38. To make the output, you have to fill the square in the middle of the grid with teal cells, keeping the border of the square grey. Then, place a single teal cell right in the middle of the top half of the grid. Repeat this process for the number of cells equal to the half of the height of the grid, progressively moving downwards until you reach the grey square.\\\\n39. To make the output, you have to replace the grey internal squares (leaving the border) in a square shape with teal squares and fill in squares on the grid above the grey square with teal squares as well. In order to identify how many squares to fill above the grey figure, count the internal grey squares along the vertical axis of the grey figure.\\\\n40. To make the output, you have to color the area within the gray square formation to teal. Also color the center row or column fully except the mirror image area of the original gray formation. Effectively, the square formation should remain in gray, everything within it should be color teal and the center row/column from top to bottom or left to right should be teal except the part covered by the mirror image of the gray formation.\\\\n41. To make the output, you have to keep the larger rectangle as it is and turn the inner square into teal. Add two lines of teal above the rectangle, each line is one cell less than the previous one, starting from the middle of the rectangle. Repeat the same below the rectangle.\\\\n42. To make the output, you have to color the inner cells of the top square teal if the majority of the cells below it (from its center to the bottom of the grid) are gray and the remaining black areas below the square to teal. Else, if there are more black cells than grey cells, the inner cells of the square remain black.\\\\n43. To make the output, in the row with the central grey(5), make all the black blocks become teal(8); inside the outlined grey(5) box, make all the black blocks become teal(8) too. If there are any black blocks below the central grey block, replace them with teal. Other parts should remain the same.\\\\n44. To make the output, find the center of the grid and replace the four points North, South, East, and West of the center (ignoring the exact center of the grid) with teal (8). When looking for the center, you need to find a point where, if you draw a horizontal or vertical line, the grey shape (5) is symmetric on both sides. Then, form a cross (vertically and horizontally symmetric) in teal (8) from the determined center. If the center lies on a grey (5) square, fill out it in teal (8) as well.\\\\n45. To make the output, you have to follow the pattern of the grey shape and place a line (teal cells) vertically along the middle of the grid. If the teal line intersects the grey object, it should be made grey instead of teal. If the teal line extends beyond the grey object, it should be stopped at the bottom edge of the grey object.\\\\n46. The transformation from input to output involves filling the hollow square with teal colors from the 3rd to 8th boxes in the center column going from the top to the bottom. If there are fewer than or equal to 5 gray boxes above the teal boxes, the box should be filled with teal. None of the gray boxes are removed in the transformation.\\\\n47. To make the output, you have to find the grey form in the center of the grid and keep it as it. Remove any grey squares that form the right line of the grey shape. Then fill the remaining area in the center that is surrounded by grey with teal. Add teal from the top till the center and from the center till the bottom to make it look like it\\\\\\'s pouring from both sides.\\\\n48. To make the output, you have to fill the empty inner square of the \"E\" or \"C\" with teal squares, hence transforming the \"C\" to an \"O\" and the \"E\" to an \"8\" figure. After that, place a vertical teal line in the row where the grey \"E\" or \"C\" was situated, but shifted to the left side of the grid.\\\\n49. To make the output, you have to color the interior of the gray square with teal color (8) and keep the gray color in its border. The whole process is like making a drawing in the center of a map. It also color the black cells that is direct under the center of the grey square by teal color (8). If the center consists of more than one cell then all should be considered.\\\\n50. To make the output, you have to replace the grey boxes in the third row from top and third row from bottom in the input grid with teal boxes. Further, replace the grey boxes in the center column with teal boxes. In the bottom third, replace all the grey boxes within two blocks of the filled center column with teal boxes. In the top third, replace all the grey boxes within two blocks of the empty center column with teal boxes.\\\\n51. To make the output, you have to fill the inside of the gray square (everything except the border) with cyan cells and draw a vertical cyan line from the center of the square to the bottom edge of the grid.\\\\n52. To make the output, you have to change all grey cells that are not on the border of the grey shape to a teal color. Then draw a vertical teal line through the center. If there is no grey shape in the middle of the grid, just draw a vertical line of teal squares in the middle of the grid.\\\\n53. The output follows the rule which maps the input shape to `5` grey color and changes the black cells `0` which are inside the shape to `8`, while the rest of the cells retain their state. For any cell in the grid, if the cell is grey `5` and is connected via line of sight (up, down, left, or right without any other grey cells in between) to another cell(s) which is also grey, color the whole line (from cell to cell(s)) as teal `8` without affecting grey. For instance, if the input is `C` shaped letter, then the gap in the `C` will be filled with teal `8`. If the input is `D` shaped letter, then the whole center of `D` will be filled with teal `8`.\\\\n54. To make the output, you have to follow the following steps: determine the shape\\\\\\'s center based on the grey squares. After determining this, replace all the black squares (0) in the column of the center with teal squares (8) including the center of the shape if it is black. However, if there is a grey square (5) in the center, it should not be changed. The squares inside the grey shape (if not at the center) should be replaced with teal squares (8). The rest of the squares that are outside the shape and are not in the center column should remain the same.\\\\n55. To make the output, you have to fill in the inner parts of the square with teal cells, also replacing any black cells directly below and above the middle of the grey square (where the grey square is originally located in the input grid) with teal cells, forming a vertical line that cuts through the center of where the grey square was.\\\\n56. To make the output, you have to fill the inside of the grey square or rectangle with teal. Then, draw a vertical teal line straight down from the center of the bottom edge of the grey shape until it reaches the bottom of the grid.\\\\n57. To make the output, you have to find the mid-point of the \"U\". Draw a vertical teal line from top to bottom at this mid-point. If the grey \"U\" shape is intersecting with this teal line, then the intersecting grey cells should remain grey. If the black cells are intersecting with this teal line, they should be turned teal. Other cells remain the same.\\\\n58. To get the output, draw a teal-colored (8) line vertically down the middle of the grey rectangle. Fill the inside of the rectangle (excluding the middle line) teal, but keep the border grey. Leave the border and any area not part of the rectangle black. If there isn\\\\\\'t a sufficient space to draw a vertical teal line, draw it below the rectangle instead. The line should start from the first non-black cell from the top in the middle column, and go down until it reaches a row identical to the first row of the grid.\\\\n59. To make the output, you have to replace the cells that are directly under the light brown block, regardless of being in the block or out of the block, with teal cells. The rest of the grid remains unchanged.\\\\n60. To make the output, you have to determine the center of the \"H\" shape and extend a vertical teal line from the top of the grid to the bottom. This line passes through the second vertical line of the \"H\" from left to right, leaving the rest of the \"H\" grey. The line continues past the \"H\", from its center to the top and bottom of the grid.\\\\n61. To turn the input into the output, change every grey cell surrounded only by black cells to teal, excluding the cells on the outermost frame of the square or rectangle. Then, add a vertical streak of teal cells going up from the middle of the top border of the shape until it reaches the top border of the whole grid. The length of this teal streak equals to the height of the grey shape.\\\\n62. To create the output, replace the black cells that are located one step beneath the gray square (looking from top to bottom) with teal cells. This step is performed whether the gray square is located at the top or bottom of the grid - it doesn\\\\\\'t matter. If the square is in the center of the grid, then teal cells appear in the middle, coinciding with the center of gray square. Additionally, fill the hollow center of the gray square with teal cells.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "Category 1: Filling the interior of a grey shape with teal and adding a vertical teal line.\nRule: If a grey shape is present, fill its interior with teal.

For each category, synthesize the rules into a single, specific rule that combines the ideas of all rules in that category, while clearly differentiating it from the other categories.\\\\nThe new rule should be as specific as possible, following the format of the given rules.\\\\nThe new rule should be applicable without any information from the original rules - i.e. it should be standalone.\\\\n\\\\nRules:\\\\n1. The transformation involves switching the colors represented by the numbers in the second and third rows while the rest of the grid remains the same. In other words, switch the colors in the second row with the same position colors in the third row for all columns except the first and last ones. Those in the first and last columns remain the same.\\\\n2. To make the output, you have to swap the second row and the third row while keeping the first row unchanged.\\\\n3. To make the output, you have to replace certain numbers (representing colors) in the input grid by other numbers from the same grid. Specifically, the number 5 needs to be replaced by the number to its right (if there is one), and the number 8 needs to be replaced by the number to its left (if there is one). All other numbers stay the same.\\\\n4. To make the output, look at each column of the input grid, and identify the color-coded number that appears most frequently in a column. Replace the color-coded number in the center of that column with the most frequently appearing number. If there is no center (the column has an even number of boxes), replace the upper-middle box of that column. If there is no most frequent number (all numbers appear the same amount of times), keep the original center number.\\\\n5. The transformation involves swapping some of the positions in the grid. Specifically, the value at the top right corner of the input grid and the value at the middle of the second row switch places. Similarly, the value at the top left corner and the value at the middle of the first row switch places. All other numbers remain the same.\\\\n6. To make the output, you require swapping two colors in the input grid. Swap the colors represented by the maximum and minimum values in the grid. For instance, if the maximum value is 8 (teal) and the minimum value is 5 (grey), all instances of 8 become 5 and vice versa. For the tie in maximum and minimum values, taking any one pair. All other colors remain the same.\\\\n7. To make the output, replace the middle value of each column with the color number (representing a color) that is on the middle row of the last column. Keep the rest of the grid the same.\\\\n8. To make the output, you have to switch the values in the second row and the second column, excluding the center value if the grid is odd-sized. For eve-sized grids, simply switch the entire second row with the second column.\\\\n9. To make the output, you need to perform an operation on the second column of the grid. If the number on the second column of the middle row is greater than the number on the second column of the top row, swap these two numbers. If not, leave them as is. All other numbers in the grid remain the same.\\\\n10. To make the output, you have to examine the diagonals of the grid from the top left corner to the bottom right corner. If there\\'s a number that appears twice in the diagonal, replace the middle number with that repeated number. For the rest grid, keep the same numbers as in the input grid.\\\\n11. The pattern is swapping the right element of the 2x2 block located in the top left corner with the central element in the middle row. Keep the rest of the elements in the grid as they are in the input.\\\\n12. To make the output, look at each row. If a row contains an orange square (7), change all the grey squares (5) in that row into teal squares (8). If a row does not contain an orange square (7), leave the grey squares (5) as they are.\\\\n13. To make the output, you have to switch the second and third columns of all rows in the input grid. This means you would take the numbers from the second column and move them to the third, and the numbers from the third column move to the second. Only the numbers in the second and third columns are switched, all other numbers stay in their original positions.\\\\n14. To make the output, you need to swap the top-right and mid-left colored objects, if they are not black.\\\\n15. To make the output, you have to look at the diagonal from the top-left to the bottom-right of the grid. The squares along this diagonal determine the color for the entire column they are in. In other words, replace all numbers in a column by a number at the same position in the main diagonal (from the top-left to the bottom-right) of the grid.\\\\n16. To make the output, identify the unique color that appears in both the second column and the second row of the grid. Replace the color of the cells in the second column with this color and keep all other cells as they are. If there is no unique color that appears in both the second column and second row, then copy the input grid to the output directly.\\\\n17. To make the output, you have to swap the second column with the first non-black color (where black is not presented in the grid) found in the last row of the grid. Replace all the non-black colors in the second column with the found color.\\\\n18. To transform the input grid into the output grid, rotate all the rows in a clockwise direction, except the last one. Leave the last row unchanged. From the perspective of someone standing on the right side of the grid looking leftward, the numbers would now appear as they would normally from this new viewpoint.\\\\n19. The rule is to replace the first number 5 after the diagonal, going line by line from top-left to bottom-right, with number 8. If there is no number 5 after diagonal, leave the line as is. If there are more than one number 5 after the diagonal, only the first one is replaced.\\\\n20. The transformation rule consists of interchanging or swapping the first color (if there\\'s more than one) per column from the top with the first color (if there\\'s more than one) per column from the bottom. If a column has the same color from top to bottom, there\\'s no swapping.\\\\n21. To make the output, identify the highest number in each row of the input grid. Change any cell in that row that contains the number 5 to the highest number. The rest of the cells should remain the same as in the input grid.\\\\n22. To get the output, you have to flip the colors along the secondary diagonal. In other words, color at (i, j) should be transferred to (j, i) position for all the numbers except the numbers on the secondary diagonal. The numbers on the secondary diagonal itself stays the same.\\\\n23. To make the output, you have to swap the value at the position (2,1) with the value at the position (2,2) for each row in the grid. If there is no value at the position (2,2), then the row remains the same. In other words, you switch the colors represented by the second and third numbers in each row, maintaining everything else in the row the same.\\\\n24. To make the output, you have to move the highest number of each column to the first position of the corresponding column unless the highest number is already at the first position. In that case, move to the first position the second highest number from the same column.\\\\n25. To make the output, you have to swap the corner elements in the quadrants or halves of the grid (if you split the grid into four quarters, the elements laying on corner of each quarter have to be swapped). For example, in a 5x5 matrix, the 2nd element in the first row gets swapped with the 2nd element in the third row, the 4th element in the first row gets swapped with the 4th element in the third row and so on. The middle row remains unchanged. If it\\'s a 3x3 grid, you only swap the middle element in the first row with the middle element in the third one.\\\\n26. To create the output, first find the largest number in the input grid (It can be more than one). Replace the number in the middle row of the output grid with the largest number from the input grid. The remaining numbers in the output grid should stay the same as they were in the input grid.\\\\n27. To make the output, you have to find the maximum numeric value in each column and replace the middle number in each row with the maximum value from its corresponding column.\\\\n28. To make the output, you have to look at each column in the grid separately. For every column, if there is red in that column, then replace all the green in that column with red. The rest of the elements in the grid remain the same.\\\\n29. To generate the output grid, you have to substitute the center grid with the color of the highest number on the edge of the grid. If there is no higher number, the color will remain the same.\\\\n30. To make the output, you have to swap the colors in the top and center row of cells.  Leave the bottom row of cells as they are.\\\\n31. For each row of the grid, find the maximum value. Then, for each cell in the row if the cell does not contain the maximum value, keep the value as is; otherwise replace it with second highest value in that row. In case of a tie choose the leftmost value.\\\\n32. To make the output, you have to detect the maximum valued cell in the second column of the input grid and replace all middle row occurrences of maximum valued cell in the second column with the first column middle cell value and vice versa.  Example, consider the first case: Maximum valued cell in the second column is 8. We replace all 8s in the middle row with 5s ([5,5,6,5,4]) and all 5s with 8s ([8,8,5,5,2]) to form the output middle row ([8,8,6,8,4]).  All other grid cells remain the same.\\\\n33. To make the output grid, you have to apply two transformations.  First transformation: check the color in the middle of the grid.   Second transformation: change the red squares adjacent to the middle square to the same color as the middle square in the input grid.  The remaining grid remains the same.\\\\n34. To make the output, you have to swap the color of the second row and second column. Replacing all numbers in the second row with their corresponding numbers in the second column of the input array and vice versa. All other numbers remain the same.\\\\n35. To convert from the input to the output grid, find the color that appears most in the original grid (if there are multiple colors with the same highest count, use the one with the smallest number representation). Then replace all the middle color in each row in the grid with that color. If a row has an even number of cells, replace the color of the cell to the left of the middle with the most common color.\\\\n36. To make the output, scan horizontally from the top row to the bottom row. If you find a lowest number (i.e., rainbow color) in a row, replace all middle numbers in that row to this color. Note that only the middle numbers are changed, preserving the first and last number of each row in their original state.\\\\n37. The pattern defined by the transformation involves replacing certain cells. In each section/column of the grid, there are cells that share the same colour. To make the output, you have to find if there is a common colour in each column and replace all other colours in the column with the most common one. If there is no most common colour (i.e. all colours are only represented once), then the column remains the same.\\\\n38. In each column, the color that appears most frequently is identified. Then, the cell in the central row of that column is colored with the most frequent color of that column. If there\\'s a tie in the frequency, use the color of the cell in the central row in the input.\\\\n39. To create the output, copy everything from the input grid to the output grid. Then for each cell that is not on the bottom row or the last column, if the number below is bigger than the number to the right, swap the bottom and right cell\\'s number in the output grid.\\\\n40. To make the output, you have to find the highest value on the main diagonal (from the top-left to bottom-right) and replace all the middle row cells (which means the second row for a 3x3 grid and second and fourth rows for a 5x5 grid) with the highest value from the main diagonal except for the cells that also belong to the main diagonal.\\\\n41. The transformation from the input grid to the output grid involves swapping two specific rows. More specifically, the second and the third row are switched places.\\\\n42. To transform the input grid into the output grid , the colored squares that are in the same horizontal line as the orange squares (7) take the color of the square that is above them. The orange squares keep their color. The other squares keep their original color as well.\\\\n43. For each column, find the highest value. If the highest value falls on the first row of the column, do nothing. If not, swap the first row with each row below it, until the highest number in the column is at the top of the column. Make sure other numbers in the same row get moved as well. If two rows have the same highest value in the same column, move the row closer to the top.\\\\n44. To make the output from the input, you have to replace the second row with the first row, and replace the first row with the second one. Essentially, it\\'s about swapping the first two rows of the grid. The order of the elements in the swapped rows remains the same and the last row remains unchanged.\\\\n45. To make the output, you have to exchange the numbers in the middle column with the numbers in the leftmost column. If the row size isn\\'t 3, then maintain the same grid.\\\\n46. To transform the input grid to the output grid, each column of the grid is examined. Within each column, if there are more blue squares (1) than teal squares (8), replace all blue squares with teal. If there are more teal squares than blue, then replace all teal squares with blue hues. If the number of blue and teal squares is equal, keep them as they are.\\\\n47. To convert the input grid to the output, switch the color in the second position of each row with the color in the second position from the last row. The other positions remain the same.\\\\n48. To make the output, you have to replace the number in the middle row with the maximum number in its respective column. This transformation rule applies to each column, changing the value at the central position of each column to the maximum value in the same column. But the other entries in the input grid stays unaltered in the output grid.\\\\n49. To make the output, first find the number that appears most often in each row of the input grid. Then replace every appearance of the number 5 in the row with the most common number in that row. If there is no 5 in a row or if there is a tie for the most common number in a row, leave that row as it is.\\\\n50. To make the output, identify the number that repeats most in each row. If a row has multiple numbers that repeat the most, take the number on the rightmost of the row. Replace all instances of 5 in that row with this number.\\\\n51. To make the output, you have to select each row and replace the middle number of each row with the number at the center of the grid i.e. center of the matrix. If the number of columns is odd, you take the number exactly in the center. If the number of columns is even, take the number which is left in the center.\\\\n52. To make the output, you have to replace the color on the second column by the color on the third column from the input grid except for the last row, which remains the same.\\\\n53. To make the output, you have to take each column and check if there are two same-colored cells. If so, replace all cells in that column by the color of those two same-color cells. Otherwise, the column remains the same.\\\\n54. To make the output, you have to look at each column individually from the input grid. If a column has \\'5\\', replace all \\'8\\'s in that column with \\'5\\'s if any exist, and replace the \\'5\\'s with \\'8\\'s. If \\'5\\' does not exist in a column, leave it unchanged.\\\\n55. To make the output, you have to select the maximum number in each column of the input grid and replace all number fives in the respective column with the maximum number. This transformation works column-wise, replacing fives with the maximum number value in each particular column if one is found. If there are no fives or any number greater than five in the column, it remains the same as in the input grid.\\\\n56. To make the output, you have to identify the color that appears most frequently in each row of the input. Then, replace the middle cell in each row with the color that appears the most in the same row. If there are multiple colors with the most frequency, keep the middle cell the same as in the input.\\\\n57. The transform pattern is as follows: * Starting from top to bottom and left to right, when color 4 is encountered in the rows, change the color of color 5 to color 8 in the same row (both before and after color 4).  * If color 4 isn\\'t present, leave the row as is. * The same operation is then applied to the columns, starting from left to right and top to bottom. When color 4 is encountered, change the color of those cells that have color 5 to color 8 in the same column (both above and below color 4). If color 4 is not present, the column is left as is.\\\\n58. The transformation of the grid is based on a diagonally-symmetric swapping operation. The first column of the grid is swapped with the third column, leaving the center (second) column and the diagonally-symmetric elements in the first and third column of each row unaltered. This operation is equivalent to folding the grid about its vertical middle axis.\\\\n59. To obtain the output, look within each row. If there\\'s a color that appears more than once in the row, replace the rest non recurring colors on the row with that color that occurs most. However, if there\\'s no recurring color in the row, keep it as it is.\\\\n60. In the transformation, the blue cells in the input grid are replaced with the color of the cell at the same position from the bottom in the input grid. The rest of the cells remain the same. In other words, vertically, the position of blue color in the grid is replaced by the color of the cell in the same position from the bottom.\\\\n61. To make the output, swap the second column with the last column of the grid. The rest of the cells in the grid remain as they are in the input.\\\\n62. To make the output, you have to search for the number 5 in the input grid. If a 5 is located in the first row, replace the second row\\'s same-column number with 8. If a 5 is located in the second row, replace the first and third row\\'s same-column number with 8.\\\\n\"}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "Category 1: Swapping Rows\n1.

More specifically, the second and the third row are switched places.\n44. To make the output from the input, you have to replace the second row with the first row, and replace the first row with the second one. Essentially, it's about swapping the first two rows of the grid. The order of the elements in the swapped rows remains the same and the last row remains unchanged.\n\nCategory 2: Swapping Columns\n8. To make the output, you have to switch the values in the second row and the second column, excluding the center value if the grid is odd-sized. For even-sized grids, simply switch the entire second row with the second column.\n13. To make the output, you have to switch the second and third columns of all rows in the input grid. This means you would take the numbers from the second column and move them to the third, and the numbers from the third column move to the second.

All other numbers stay the same.\n19. The rule is to replace the first number 5 after the diagonal, going line by line from top-left to bottom-right, with number 8.

If there is no center (the column has an even number of boxes), replace the upper-middle box of that column. If there is no most frequent number (all numbers appear the same amount of times), keep the original center number.\n37. The pattern defined by the transformation involves replacing certain cells. In each section/column of the grid, there are cells that share the same colour. To make the output, you have to find if there is a common colour in each column and replace all other colours in the column with the most common one. If there is no most common colour (i.e. all colours are only represented once), then the column remains the same.\n38. In each column, the color that appears most frequently is identified. Then, the cell in the central row of that column is colored with the most frequent color of that column. If there's a tie in the frequency, use the color of the cell in the central row in the input.\n35. To convert from the input to the output grid, find the color that appears most in the original grid (if there are multiple colors with the same highest count, use the one with the smallest number representation).

For each category, synthesize the rules into a single, specific rule that combines the ideas of all rules in that category, while clearly differentiating it from the other categories.\\\\nThe new rule should be as specific as possible, following the format of the given rules.\\\\nThe new rule should be applicable without any information from the original rules - i.e. it should be standalone.\\\\n\\\\nRules:\\\\n1. To make the output, you should look for a condition where at least one cell from the yellow square and one cell from the green square vertically align. If this condition is met, the whole corresponding row in the output is transformed into a fuchsia square (represented by 6). Otherwise, the cells stay black. Note: Vertical alignment means that if a yellow cell and green cell lie on the same column, they are considered vertically aligned.\\\\n2. To make the output, you have to look at pairs of squares in the input. Each pair is a yellow square and a green square. If the yellow square (4) is on the left, and the green square (3) is on the right, convert the pair into a fuchsia square (6). If the pair is not matching, it should become black (0). Perform this transformation for each pair. The output will be fuschia and black squares only.\\\\n3. To transform the grid, you are needed to divide each row into two segments, such that each segment consists of three cells. In each segment, if there is at least one cell that is yellow (4) and one cell that is green (3), then replace the entire segment with fuschia (6). Otherwise, if there are no such cells, then replace the segment with black (0).\\\\n4. To create the output, the grid needs to be divided into 3x2 sections from left to right. Each 3x2 section needs to be replaced by just a single cell in the output. This cell should be coloured fuschia if there is overlap between the yellow and green shapes in a certain section, otherwise it should be left blank.\\\\n5. Divide the input grid into two equal parts vertically. If there are yellow cells on both sides of the vertical split for a given row, make the corresponding cell in the output grid fuschia. And if there is a yellow cell on either side only, then also make the corresponding cell in the output grid fuschia. If there is no yellow cell in a row, leave the corresponding cell in the output grid black.\\\\n6. To make the output, you have to compare each yellow cell of the left 3x3 grid with the corresponding green cell in the right 3x3 grid, (considering the top left cell of each 3x3 grid as the 1st cell, next-to-right as the 2nd, and so on till the 9th cell on the right most bottom). If either of the cell is colored (not black), paint the same cell in a new 3x3 grid with fuchsia. If both the cells are black, leave it black.\\\\n7. To convert the input grid to the output grid, split the input grid into left and right halves. If a cell in the left half of the grid matches the corresponding cell in the right half, color it fuschia; otherwise, color it black.\\\\n8. The transformation pattern involves compressing the input grid into half its size. For this, you divide the input grid into pairs of columns from left to right. If at least one yellow box (represented by number 4) is present in a pair of column, put a fuschia (represented by number 6) box in the corresponding position in the output. Otherwise, copy over what\\\\\\'s in the right column of each pair to the corresponding cell in the output.\\\\n9. To transform the input into the output, you have to slice the grid into 2 columns of width 3 each, where the left slice represents yellow squares and the right slice represents green squares. Each slice is represented as a column in the output.  For the yellow part, if there is at least one yellow square in the original 3x3 slice, the corresponding cell in the output is colored fuschia (represented by 6). If there are no yellow squares in the original 3x3 slice, the corresponding output cell is black (represented by 0).   The same rule applies for the green part in the input and its representation in the output.  In other words, the presence of at least one colored square (yellow or green) in a 3x3 slice results in a change to fuschia in the output, while lack of colored squares results in a black cell in the output.\\\\n10. To transform the input to the output, we need to superimpose the left half and the right half of the grid after slicing it vertically. If neither squares on the two halves are colored, the corresponding square in the output is left as black. If only one square is colored, the corresponding square in the output becomes fuschia. If both squares are colored, make the output square fuschia.\\\\n11. The transformation involves merging the left and right sections of the grid. Specifically, for each row, merge every two cells of the same colour from left and right, and represent it in purple (represented by 6). If one of the two cells in a pair on the left and right side is black, represent that pair in the output with a black cell.\\\\n12. To make the output, you have to merge every two columns of the input into one on the output by the following rule: If at least one cell in the two columns is yellow (4), then the cell in the output grid will be fuschia (6). If there are no yellow cells but at least one cell is green (3), then the cell in the output grid will be fuschia (6). If both cells are black (0) then the cell in the output grid will be black (0).\\\\n13. In order to transform the input into the output, each 2x2 square of the same color in the input becomes one square of the same color in the output. If the 2x2 square consists of different colors, it becomes black in the output. The fuschia color square is then created from the yellow and green squares positioned diagonally against each other, while black spaces in the input remain the same in the output i.e. they contribute to the black spaces in the output.\\\\n14. To make the output, you have to combine the yellow and green colors into one in each grid. If you see a green or yellow color in any position of the 2x2 grid on the input, color it as fuchsia in the corresponding position in the output grid. If there is no color, then leave it as black.\\\\n15. To make the output, you have to merge every 2x2 square in the input grid into a single square in the output grid. If all the squares in the 2x2 square are yellow, then the square in the output grid should be fuchsia. If all the squares are green, then the output square should be green. If there is a mix of green and yellow squares, then the square in the output grid should also be fuchsia.\\\\n16. To make the output, you have to calculate the sum of the squares in a specific row for the yellow and green regions. If all squares in the row of the yellow region are yellow and all squares in the row of the green region are green, color the corresponding row in the output grid as fuschia. If that is not the case, keep the squares in the output black.\\\\n17. To make the output, you have to observe the left and right column in each row of the input grid. If both columns are colored or both are black, place a magenta number in the output grid. If one column is colored and one is black, place a black number in the output grid.\\\\n18. To make the output, you have to consider each 2x2 square in the input. If any cell in the 2x2 square is yellow, represent that with a fuschia cell in the output grid. Otherwise, if all cells in the 2x2 square are black, represent that with a black cell in the output grid.\\\\n19. To make the output, you have to change the 3x6 grid into a 3x3 grid. Each 2x2 sector from the input forms a cell in the output. If the sector is a mix of colors (yellow/green) and black, colors win and it is mapped to the fuschia (6). If there is only one color or black in a sector, the majority color is chosen (yellow -> fuschia (6), green -> fuschia (6), black stays black).\\\\n20. To make the output, you have to merge the two 3x3 squares on the left (yellow and black) and right (green and black) into a single 3x3 square, turning every cell fuschia if (in the same position) the colors are different in left and right side, or turning every cell black if (in the same position) the colors are the same in left and right side.\\\\n21. To make the output, you need to convert the input square into a 3 by 3 grid by eliminating the middle column of black cells. The rules for coloring is the following. In each pair of adjacent cells in the input grid, if both of them are colored (not black), color the corresponding output cell in fuschia (number 6), regardless of the colors in the input cells. If only one is colored, do not color the output cell (leave it black). If both are black, the output cell should also be black. Use the horizontal cell pairs to determine the color of the output cells. The middle row in the output is determined by the separated yellow and green cells in the input. By mapping the input grid into an output grid with the given rules, we can successfully transform the grid.\\\\n22. To make the output, you have to merge every couple of vertical columns from the initial grid into one column in the output grid. The rule of merging is that if you see any pixel in green (3) within the vertical couple, the pixel in the new column will be fuschia(6); if not, just copy the corresponding pixel from the first column of the pair in the input grid. Then repeat this process for all vertical pairs in the input grid to form a resultant 3x3 output grid.\\\\n23. To create the output grid, you need to condense the input grid by averaging the areas of each 2x2 block in the input. If a block carries both yellow and green, you color the corresponding cell in the output grid with fuschia. If a block only has one color, you reflect the color in the output - yellow is transformed to yellow, and green is transformed to green. If a block is only composed of black cells, the corresponding cell in the output remains black.\\\\n24. To make the output, you should transform each column of three squares in the input into a single square in the output. If there is one or more yellow squares in the column, then the corresponding output square should be yellow. If there are no yellow squares but one or more green squares, then the output square should be green. If there are no yellow or green squares, then the output square should be black.\\\\n25. To make the output, you have to group every pair of columns from the input grid into one. If the matching cells in each pair (either from yellow and green sections) contains at least one colored cell (yellow or green), color the corresponding cell in the output grid as fuchsia. If both cells in a pair are black, the corresponding cell in the output grid remains black.\\\\n26. To make the output, collapse each pair of cells along the column of the input grid into a single cell on the output grid as follows: if either of the input pair is colored (blue or green), color the output as fuschia, else if both are black, leave the output cell as black too.\\\\n27. To make the output, you have to consider the two 3x3 squares from the input. If a cell in the first 3x3 square is yellow and the corresponding cell (same position) in the second 3x3 square is green, then the corresponding cell in the output becomes fuschia. For all other cases, the cell in the output remains black.\\\\n28. To make the output, you have to convert the 6 columns in the input into 3 in the output by combining every two columns in the input to be one in the output. The rule for combining is if there is at least one yellow cell in the two input columns, that column in the output is fuschia. If there are no yellow cells in the two input columns, the column in the output is kept black.\\\\n29. To make the output, look at each pair of squares (either yellow or green) in the input grid. If both squares in the pair are colored, make the corresponding square in the output grid fuschia. If only one square in the pair is colored, or neither are colored, make the corresponding square in the output grid black.\\\\n30. To make the output, you have to compress each 2x2 subgrid in the input into a single cell in the output. If the 2x2 subgrid in the input contains at least one green cell, then its corresponding cell in the output is green. If not, then if the 2x2 subgrid in the input contains at least one blue cell, then its corresponding cell in the output is blue. If the 2x2 subgrid in the input does not contain neither green nor blue cells, then its corresponding cell in the output is black.  Mapped the colours as: 0:black; 3:green; 4:blue; 6:fuschia.\\\\n31. To make the output, you have to compare each corresponding cell in the two halves of the grid. If both cells are colored (not black), then the corresponding cell in the output grid will be fuschia. If at least one cell is black, the corresponding cell in the output grid will be black. Each 2x2 block in the input corresponds to a single cell in the output.\\\\n32. To make the output, you need to convert into fuschia the yellow and green boxes in the spots where the green line intersects the yellow boxes in the input grid and retain the positions of remaining blank/empty boxes.\\\\n33. To make the output, count the number of colored (not black) cells in both sections. If the number of colored cells in left is equal to or more than right, color corresponding cell on left in output as fuschia. However, if the number of colored cells in right part of the grid is more than left, color corresponding cell on right in output as fuschia.\\\\n34. To make the output, you have to divide the grid into three 2x2 squares. For each square, if there is at least one yellow square, you should fill the corresponding cell in output grid as fuschia. If there are only black or green cells, output it as black cell.\\\\n35. To make the output, you have to merge each pair of cells horizontally from the input grid. If one or both cells in the pair are colored (either yellow or green), the corresponding cell in the output grid will be fuchsia. If both cells in the pair are black, the corresponding cell in the output grid will also be black.\\\\n36. To make the output, you need to collapse every two columns into one by using the following rule: If in the two columns there is at least one blue cell and at least one green cell, the new cell (in the output grid) will be fuchsia. If there isn\\\\\\'t both a blue and green cell within the two columns, the new cell will be black.\\\\n37. Divide the input grid vertically into half. The first blue half from the left will reflect the same pattern with fuchsia color in the output while the second half with green squares will reflect a fuchsia pattern colored in mirror image. Black squares are unchanged.\\\\n38. The transformation process could be described as a collapsing of the regions vertically and summarizing their contents within each corresponding cell. The rule of conversion is defined by the presence of both the blue (4) and red (3) colors in any given segment of the input grid. If both colors are present, then the output will be fuchsia (6), otherwise, the output will retain the state of its color in the corresponding section.\\\\n39. To make the output grid, first divide the input grid vertically into two parts where the dividing line is the middle column of the 6x3 input grid which is fully filled with black cells. Now, replace each yellow cell with a teal color in the left half and each green cell with a teal color in the right half of the grid obtained after division. Merge these two halves ignoring the black cells in between them to form the final 3x3 output grid.\\\\n40. To make the output, you have to transform each 2x2 block of the input grid into a single cell in the output. The cell in the output grid should be fuschia if there exists at least one yellow cell in the corresponding 2x2 block and at least one green cell. If not, the cell should be black.\\\\n41. Create a 3x3 grid. Each cell in the new grid corresponds to a 2x2 area in the input grid: the top left cell in the 3x3 grid corresponds to the top left 2x2 area in the input grid, the top middle cell in the 3x3 grid corresponds to the top-middle 2x2 area in the input grid, and so on. In each of these 2x2 areas, if at least one cell is yellow and one cell is green, then the corresponding cell in the 3x3 grid becomes fuschia; if not, the corresponding cell in the 3x3 grid remains black.\\\\n42. The output grid is formed by following this rule: For each square in the output grid, consider the corresponding 2x2 square in the same position in the input grid but spanning both the yellow and green colored squares. If there is at least one yellow AND one green square in these 2x2 squares, color the corresponding square in the output grid fuschia. Otherwise, leave it black.\\\\n43. To make the output, you have to convert the 3x6 grid into a 3x3 grid by merging each pair of columns, where if either or both cells in the pair are colored (either yellow or green), the cell in the output grid will be colored in fuchsia, overwriting the prevalent black cells.\\\\n44. To create the output, first divide the input grid into two parts, vertically down the middle. The left side represents the yellow rectangles and the right side represents the green rectangles. Now, combine these two parts by superimposing them. If both parts have a colored cell (yellow or green) in the same position, leave it as is. If only one part has a colored cell, the other part seeing a black cell, color that cell fuschia (6). If both are black, leave it black. The result is a 3x3 grid.\\\\n45. To make the output, you have to condense each 2x2 grid of the matching color on the input into one block in the output. For example, if there are two yellow blocks in the 2x2 grid square, that gets evolved to one block in the output. This smaller grid (3x3) is filled with purple or black blocks depending on the original color. If the original 2x2 area is predominantly yellow, make the corresponding block in the output grid yellow. If the original 2x2 area is predominantly green, make the corresponding block in the output grid green. If the original 2x2 area is predominantly black, keep the corresponding block in the output grid black.\\\\n46. Split the input grid into two halves. Convert each pair of columns into a single column in the output grid. For each cell, if the left cell is yellow and there is no green cell on the right side at the same position, make the cell in the output grid fuschia. Otherwise, keep it black.\\\\n47. To make the output, you have to consider corresponding cells in the two halves. If at least one of the corresponding cells in the two halves is colored (either blue or green), make the output cell fuschia (6). If neither of the corresponding cells is colored, leave the output cell black. This is essentially performing a logical OR operation on the cells of the two halves and mapping the result to fuschia or black.\\\\n48. To make the output, you have to split each horizontal row into two sections, discarding the black blocks. If the yellow block is present in that section, mark the corresponding section with a fuchsia block in the output grid. If no yellow block is present, leave the section of the output grid as black.\\\\n49. To make the output, you have to merge every two columns into one, from left to right. If one or both cells in the two columns are yellow in a row, then the corresponding cell in the output grid (for that row and the merged column) becomes fuschia (6). If both cells in the two columns are green or black, then the corresponding cell in the output grid becomes black.\\\\n50. The condition to transform the grid is to count the number of yellow squares in each column of the input grid. If the number of yellow squares is one or more, the output for that column should be fuschia (6). If the number of yellow squares is zero, the output for that column should be black (0). The output grid should have the columns compressed, where two columns in the input correspond to one column in the output. The colors of the squares from the top column and the bottom column in the input get \"merged\" into one in the output.\\\\n51. To make the output, you have to divide the original 3x6 grid into three 3x2 sections, from left to right. Then, in each section, if a yellow square or a green square exists, the corresponding position in the output grid will be fuchsia (value 6). If the 3x2 section only contains empty or black spaces, the corresponding space in the output 3x3 grid will remain black or empty.\\\\n52. The transformation is done by comparing the corresponding cells in the two rectangles. The cell is fuschia (6) in the output if the color of the cell in the yellow and green rectangles match. If they do not match, the cell is black (0).\\\\n53. To make the output, you have to resize the input grid from 3x6 to 3x3. If a cell contains more than half yellow (4) cells in the original grid, color it fuschia (6) in the new grid. If a cell contains less than or equal to half yellow cells, keep it black (0).\\\\n54. To make the output, you first divide the input grid into equal squares, each containing 2x2 cells. Replace each 2x2 square in the input with a single cell in the output. The rule for assigning the number in the output cell is based on the numbers in the corresponding input square - if at least three cells in the 2x2 input square have the same number and are not 0 then the corresponding output cell is assigned number 6. Otherwise, the cell in the output is assigned number 0.\\\\n55. To make the output, you have to divide the grid into three 2x3 grids. If there is at least one yellow cell in the part of the grid, make the corresponding cell in the output grid fuschia, otherwise leave it black.\\\\n56. The output of the transformation can be determined by comparing cells in the same position within the yellow and green regions in each row. If there is a yellow cell (4) in the same relative position as a green cell (3) within their respective regions in a row in the input, the corresponding cell in the output is changed to fuschia (6). All other cells will remain the same in the output as the input grid.\\\\n57. To make the output, you need to merge every two adjacent columns from the input into one in the output. If in any of these two columns there is at least one cell that contains a yellow color (4), we color the corresponding cell in the output as fuschia (6). If not (it\\\\\\'s either all green (3) or black(0)), we keep it as is.\\\\n58. To get the output from the input, divide the input grid vertically into two equal 3x3 matrices. In the output, check the corresponding cells from the two split matrices. If a cell is not black in both matrices it becomes fuchsia in the output. If at least one of the matrices has a black cell at a particular position, the corresponding cell in the output is black.\\\\n59. To make the output, you should compress each row from the input into a single row in the output, such that the two blocks in each row in the input corresponds to one block in the output. If there is a yellow block and a green block in the same row in the input, you should produce a fuchsia block in the output. If one of these colored blocks is missing in the input row, there should be a black space where that block should have been in the output. The block of green in the third row in the input should be compressed to a fuchsia block in the output.\\\\n60. To transform the grid, overlap the two halves of the input grid onto each other. Wherever both halves have the same colored boxes (yellow or green), mark it as fuscia (number 6). If they don\\\\\\'t have the same color, keep the location black.\\\\n61. To create the output, you should shrink the input grid by a scale of 2 vertically and horizontally, taking the 2x2 blocks in the the input grid (4 squares) and turning into one square in the output grid.   If at least one of the 4 squares in the input grid block is yellow or green (non-black), turn the corresponding square in the output grid fuschia.   If all 4 squares in the input grid block are black, turn the corresponding square in the output grid black.\\\\n62. To create the output, the grid is scaled down. The original rectangles that are 2 rows by 2 columns are replaced with 1x1 squares in the output. When downscaling,  whenever there is a color (yellow or green) in any of the cells of the original 2x2 rectangle, its corresponding cell in the downscaled grid takes the color fuchsia. If all the cells in the 2x2 rectangle are black, then the corresponding cell in the output grid also remains black.\\\\n63. To make the output, compare the two squares found in the corresponding columns of yellow and green. If both squares are colored, color the square in the output fuschia (represented by the number 6). If only one square is colored, make a fuschia square for the square in the yellow column and a black square for the square in the green column. If both squares are black, the corresponding square in the output should be black.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "Category 1: Vertical Alignment and Transformation\nRule: If at least one cell from the yellow square and one cell from the green square vertically align, the whole corresponding row in the output is transformed into a fuchsia square.

To make the output, you should detect colored cells such as red, green, or teal, then fill adjacent cells in the vertical and horizontal directions that are charcoal in color with blue. The color of the originally colored cells should not change. Do not fill diagonally surrounding cells or cells that are already in color. Cells that are not adjacent to any colored cells should remain in charcoal color.\\\\n2. To make the output, you have to fill in the blank cells around the colored cell with blue, above the Fuschia colored line, including diagonal ones. But make sure the cells under or on the fuschia colored line, remain the same.\\\\n3. To make the output, you have to generate a new blue disk for every square directly above, below, left, or right from the colored dots (in cross shape), as long as the adjacent squares are black. Do not overwrite the colored dots with blue. After spreading the blue discs, keep the grid the same size as the input.\\\\n4. To generate the output grid, for each colored number greater than 1 in the input grid, fill in the surrounding cells (that are not already filled by a number) with blue (1), if they are black (0) in the input grid. If there is another colored number in the surrounding cells, they should remain as it is.\\\\n5. To make the output, you have to turn all the black squares that are adjacent to other colored squares into blue and leave all other squares as they are. Only count squares that are adjacent in the traditional sense (up,down,left,right) not diagonal.\\\\n6. To make the output, you have to turn any neighborhood black cell surrounding any color (non-black cell) into a blue cell. The neighborhood is made by cells which are directly vertical or horizontal from the colored cell. But remember: leave the colored cell, represented by numbers other than 0, unchanged.\\\\n7. To make the output, you have to place blue cells in all the neighboring cells of the colored cells, except the ones that are vertically or horizontally adjacent to colored cells which are dark/black otherwise. The colored cells retain their color.\\\\n8. To make the output grid, replace all the black cells surrounding a colored cell with blue cells, the same color across all the inputs. An important condition is that it doesn\\\\\\'t matter the color of the colored cell, the surrounding cells change to blue. However, note that this transformation does not affect any rows that consist entirely of black cells or colored cells that are surrounded exclusively by not-black cells. Leave these as they are.\\\\n9. To make the output, you must identify the presence of the color red (represented by the number 2), which acts as a \"catalyst\". Surrounding the red cells, transform all neighboring black cells to a blue color (represented by number 1). Any black cells not adjacent to red remain unchanged. Other colored cells, apart from red, do not react and are left as is.\\\\n10. In the output, all black spaces that are directly adjacent (horizontally or vertically, not diagonally) to any colored dot in the input become blue. The colored dots from the input grid remain the same color in the output grid, and all other spaces stay black.\\\\n11. To make the output, you have to fill in the surrounding pixels immediately surrounding a colored pixel (not diagonally) with blue, only if the original surrounding pixel is black. Keep all other pixels as they were.\\\\n12. The rule of transformation involves spreading the color of the colored cell to its horizontally and vertically adjacent cells, while maintaining the color of the original cell. If the adjacent cells are not black, the color within them does not change. The new color to be added to the previously black adjacent cells is blue.\\\\n13. To make the output, you have to turn the black cells that are orthogonally adjacent to the colored cell(s) into blue cells. Keep the rest of the cells in their original colors, do not change them.\\\\n14. To make the output, you have to fill the empty squares adjacent to the colored square(s) from every direction with blue. The rest of the grid remains the same.\\\\n15. To transform the input into the output, you need to look for all colored digits in the input. Replace all black cells in the same row and column as the colored cells with blue cells but leave the cells that are in the intersection of the row and column with the original colored cell as black. All other cells remain unchanged.\\\\n16. The transformation rule is to fill the cells that are horizontally, vertically or diagonally adjacent to the colored cell(s) in the grid to blue, but only if they were not previously colored. The originally colored cells from the input remain the same color in the output. The rest of the cells (those not adjacent to colored cells) remain black. This process can be visualised as the spreading or influence of the colored cells to their immediate neighbouring cells.\\\\n17. To transform the grid, find the colored dot and turn all immediately adjacent horizontal and vertical black cells into blue cells. Diagonal adjacency doesn\\\\\\'t count. Leave the rest of the grid as it is.\\\\n18. To transform the input into the output, all cells in the 4 orthogonal directions (up, down, left, and right) from the colored numbers should be changed to blue, unless blocked by another colored number or by the edge of the grid. The colored numbers from the input should remain the same in the output.\\\\n19. To make the output, you have to convert all black (0) squares that are horizontally or vertically adjacent to a non-zero square into blue (1). Leave the remaining black and non-zero squares as they are. Do not consider diagonal cells.\\\\n20. To make the output, you have to turn all black cells that are orthogonally adjacent to a colored cell to blue. Leave all cells diagonal to a colored cell and all cells not adjacent to a colored cell black. Keep all original colored cells the same color.\\\\n21. To make the output, you keep the cells that were colored in the input grid. Then, for each cell that is adjacent to a colored cell (i.e., every cell that shares a side with the colored cell), you should color it blue. All other cells should remain black.\\\\n22. To create the output grid, place a blue pixel at a location if the row or the column of this pixel (excluding this pixel itself) in the input grid has a colored pixel (other than black). All colored pixels in the input grid (other than black) will remain unchanged in the output grid. The rest of the pixels in the output grid will be black.\\\\n23. To make the output, replace all black cells immediately adjacent to a non-black cell by a blue cell, while the remainder of the setup remains the same.\\\\n24. To make the output, you have to transform all the black cells that are directly adjacent (bottom, top, left or right) to a colored cell into blue. Other cells remain as they are in the input.\\\\n25. The transformation process involves generating a blue cross (made up of ones) with the colored cell from the input at its center. The remaining cells preserve their original state from the input grid.\\\\n26. To make the output, fill in all the cells that are immediately adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to the colored cells (not black) with blue, if they\\\\\\'re black. Leave the colored cells as they are. If there\\\\\\'s another colored cell in the vicinity of the newly filled blue cells, do not change its color. In simpler terms, the original colored points propagate their color to adjacent black cells, turning them blue, without overwriting other original colors.\\\\n27. To make the output, you have to turn every black cell which is adjacent (at least one side sharing a wall) to a colored cell (any color other than black) into a blue cell. Colored cells or black cells which are not adjacent to a colored cell retain their color. For instance, an isolated red cell in the input grid will have blue cells surrounding it in the output grid.\\\\n28. To make the output, you need to change all the black pixels surrounding the colored pixels to blue. All other cells remain the same as the original input. Note: The colored pixel has eight surrounding cells in total. In case the colored pixel is positioned at the corner, it has three surrounding cells. If the colored pixel is positioned at the edge (not the corner), it has five surrounding cells.\\\\n29. To make the output, for any non-black cell, color the surrounding black cells in a direct vertical or horizontal line to that cell, in all directions until you reach a non-black cell or the grid edge, with blue. Maintain the original colors of the few non-black cells.\\\\n30. To make the output, you have to find the colored object and replace the black squares that are above, below and to the sides of the colored square with blue, and leave the rest of the black squares as they are. The grey line should remain untouched.\\\\n31. To make the output, you have to get the 3x3 square area where the colored cell is at the center. Then change all the black cells surrounding the colored cell in the 3x3 area into blue, keep the colored cell as the original, and don\\\\\\'t change anything beyond this 3x3 area.\\\\n32. To make the output, you have to change all adjacent black cells to blue if the black cell is neighboring a colored cell other than black and is separated by a straight line either horizontally or vertically. The rest of the grid remains the same.\\\\n33. The pattern involves replacing black cells which are connected horizontally or vertically with a coloured cell with blue whenever they are adjacent to a coloured cell horizontally or vertically.\\\\n34. To make the output, you have to replace each adjacent black box to the colored boxes with a blue box (1). Leave the colored boxes and any black boxes not adjacent to a colored box as they are. An adjacent box means a box that touches another box by a side or vertex (diagonally).\\\\n35. To make the output, mark all the cells of the input that are horizontally or vertically adjacent to the non-black cell with a blue color. The original colored cell remains in the same color, and the remaining cells stay black. In other words, extend the non-black cell in the horizontal and vertical directions with the blue color while preserving the original position and color.\\\\n36. To make the output, you need to first locate the non-black numbers. Create a rectangle around each colored number (excluding the green colored number) by filling the cells that are orthogonally adjacent to it with blue. All other cells should remain the same as in the input.\\\\n37. To make the output, you have to replace every black cell that is horizontal or vertical neighbor to a non-black cell with a blue cell. The non-black cells and the isolated black cells (which are not adjacent to any non-black cells) remain unchanged.\\\\n38. To make the output, you have to change all the cells that surround the group of colored cells to blue cells in the output. The cells in the very corner do not count as surrounding cells if they are not directly adjacent (not including diagonally) to a colored cell. Everything else stays the same.\\\\n39. To make the output, you have to fill in the black cells surrounding each colored cell with blue cells, except for those below the colored cell if it is positioned at the very top of the grid, or those above if it is positioned at the very bottom. For colored cells in the middle, don\\\\\\'t fill the black cells above and below them.\\\\n40. To make the output, you have to fill all the cells that are horizontally or vertically adjacent to a colored cell with blue. The cells that were colored in the input remain the same color in the output, and the cells that are not adjacent to a colored cell remain black.\\\\n41. To make the output, you have to fill in the black cells around the colored cells with a blue number (1) leaving two black columns on the right side assuming there are no colored cells in the last two columns. The transformation does not change the colored cells present in the input grid. The transformation only acts on the black cells surrounding the colored cells.\\\\n42. To make the output, you should preserve the positions of the colored squares just like the input grid. Next, fill all the black squares that are next to a non-black square (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) with blue. All the remaining squares should be left black.\\\\n43. To make the output, you have to consider the vertical column of the colored cell. You should turn all the black cells in that vertical column into blue, except for the fuschia and any other colored cells that would retain their colors. Furthermore, the transformation does not affect any cell within the row of the colored cell.\\\\n44. To create the output, you must carry out the following steps: Start by locating any non-black cell (except green) in the input, then convert every black cell directly adjacent to it in the North, East, South, or West direction into blue. Follow this process for all such non-black cells, while leaving the rest of the cells untouched including the green rows or columns.\\\\n45. To make the output, you have to fill in all the black cells surrounded by non-black cells on all sides (top, bottom, left and right) with a blue color. Note that this doesn\\\\\\'t apply to black cells in the edges of the grid, as they are not surrounded by non-black cells on all sides.\\\\n46. To make the output, only one transformation rule must be applied. If a cell on the square of the 3x3 cells around the different color cell is black, then it should be changed to blue. The other cells should keep the same.\\\\n47. To make the output, you have to identify the colored squares in the input grid. Then replace the black squares which are horizontally and vertically adjacent to the colored squares with blue squares. The rest of the squares remains the same as in the input grid.\\\\n48. To make the output grid, fill blue 1s in the squares that are immediately adjacent to the colored cell (either horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally). Keep the rest of the grid the same as the input, including the colored cell and the row of gray cells.\\\\n49. To make the output, count the black cells that are directly adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to the colored cell and replace them with blue cells (1). Cells that are colored other than black don\\\\\\'t change and black cells that are not adjacent to any colored cell should remain black.\\\\n50. To make the output, you have to change all the black squares to blue that are horizontally or vertically adjacent to a colored square - the color of which is not black. All other squares remain unchanged. This gives the impression of an \"aura\" or \"halo\" of blue around each colored square.\\\\n51. To make the output, you have to replace all the black boxes that are adjacent (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally) to the colored boxes with blue boxes, creating a patch of blue boxes surrounding the colored boxes. The black boxes with no colored neighbor remain black. The colored boxes remain the same.\\\\n52. To make the output, you have to replace all the black cells surrounding the colored cell with blue cells, with the exception of the black cells that are below a black cells row or rows.\\\\n53. To transform the grid, you have to change the cells in the vicinity of each colored cell (except for grey), and turn the black cells into blue. The vicinity includes the cells directly above, below, to the left and to the right of each colored cell. If the cell is at the edge, the vicinity does not include cells that would be outside the grid. The colored cells themselves are not changed. The vicinity of the grey cell does not change.\\\\n54. To make the output, you have to replace black cells that are adjacent to non-black cells with a blue cell. If a black cell is not adjacent to a non-black cell, it remains black. Non-black cells are not changed. Connected cells are those horizontally, vertically and diagonally next to a given cell.\\\\n55. To get from the input to the output, identify all non-black blocks in the input. For each of these colored blocks, color all the neighboring blocks (up, down, left, and right) blue while keeping the original colored block\u2019s color the same. The rest of the blocks remain black.\\\\n56. To make the output, you have to explore the adjacency of a colored cell. If a black cell is connected to a colored cell either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, it will be turned into blue. The rest of the cells will remain the same.\\\\n57. To make the output, you have to affect the neighbors of the cell that contains different color, in case there are more than one different color on the grid treat each one of them separately. If the neighbor cell is black, change it into blue and leave the cell having different color as it is; but do not affect the center cell. If the cell is on the border of the grid or there is more than one cell distance between the cells, treat the border or that distance as an obstacle not to affect the cell across it.\\\\n58. To make the output, you need to fill the squares that are horizontally or vertically adjacent to the colored boxes (not including the gray one), with blue color. All other boxes remain the same as they were at the beginning.\\\\n59. To transform the input grid into the output, fill all black cells located orthogonally adjacent to a non-black cell with the color represented by the number 1 (blue). Leave all the other cells as they are in the input grid.\\\\n60. To create the output grid, look at each non-black (numbered) figure in the input grid and take note of its position. Then paint the box of its corresponding position in the output grid with the color denoted by the figure\\\\\\'s number. Additionally, paint all the directly adjacent boxes (up, down, left, and right but not diagonally) to the figure\\\\\\'s position in the output grid blue (represented by the number 1), if they are not already occupied by a figure from the input grid. The remaining boxes in the output grid that have not been filled with color remain black.\\\\n61. To make the output, you have to turn the black squares into blue squares if they are adjacent (diagmatically, vertically or horizontally)to the colored cells which are above the grey line. The rest of the grid remains the same.\\\\n62. To transform the grid, you need to observe the surrounding cells of each non-black cell or colored cells in the input grid. Change the color of all the cells in the immediate north, south, east, and west of the colored cell to blue. The colored cell and all other cells remain as they are. If a cell is already colored, it will not change its color.\\\\n63. To make the output, you have to color the adjacent black cells to any colored cell which are not separated by the colored row with blue. The original color of the cell remains the same.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "Category 1: Rules that involve filling in adjacent cells (horizontally and vertically) to colored cells with blue, without considering diagonal cells.\n- Rule: To make the output, you have to fill in the black cells that are horizontally or vertically adjacent to any colored cell with blue.

For each category, synthesize the rules into a single, specific rule that combines the ideas of all rules in that category, while clearly differentiating it from the other categories.\\\\nThe new rule should be as specific as possible, following the format of the given rules.\\\\nThe new rule should be applicable without any information from the original rules - i.e. it should be standalone.\\\\n\\\\nRules:\\\\n1. To make the output, you need to create a vertical line of teal pixels from the leftmost teal pixel straight up to the first teal pixel encountered. Similarly, create a horizontal line of teal pixels from the lowest teal pixel to the rightmost teal pixel encountered. This will create a rough square or rectangle of teal lines within the grid if there is more than one pixel. If there is only one pixel, the input and output grids will be the same.\\\\n2. To make the output, you have to connect all the teal dots in the input grid by drawing a continuous teal line from the leftmost teal dot to the rightmost teal dot in each row of the grid. If there is a single teal dot, the line should start and end at the dot itself. If there are no teal dots in a row, leave the row blank (black).\\\\n3. To make the output, you have to draw teal lines linking the teal squares. Each teal square has a corresponding left and right partner on the same row and one corresponding partner on lower layers. Draw a line of teal boxes from each teal square to its partner on the left or right, and downward to the corresponding partner in lower layers. If no partner is found, leave the square isolated.\\\\n4. The pattern relates to the teal cells. To transform the input into the output, you need to connect the teal cells vertically and horizontally creating straight lines. When a teal cell has another teal cell to its right side or below it, you should fill in the cells between the two teal cells with the same color (teal). You should not connect diagonal or upward cells. Only cells to the right and below the initial teal cell should be considered.\\\\n5. To make the output, you have to draw a line of teal cells that connect the scattered teal cells. The line should only be drawn horizontally and vertically, not diagonally. Start drawing the line from the leftmost teal cell, continue rightwards across any other cell in the same row, until a black cell is encountered. Then turn downwards vertically across any other cell in the same column, continuing until a black cell is encountered. This process is repeated horizontally and vertically to form the output.\\\\n6. To make the output, you need to fill the missing spots between the teal points in a straight line. The rule applies both vertically and horizontally. If the teal point has no other teal point on its row or column, it remains the same.\\\\n7. To make the output, you have to connect the teal dots that are on the same line (either vertically or horizontally) with a straight solid teal line. It\\\\\\'s important to note that if the teal dots can\\\\\\'t connect through a straight line (either vertically or horizontally), they should be left untouched on the output grid.\\\\n8. To make the output, you have to draw vertical and horizontal lines by replacing the black cells with teal cells (no. 8) between teal points that are inline either horizontally or vertically. Note that vertical lines are drawn towards the top and horizontal lines are drawn towards the left. If more than two points are inline, connect all inline points.\\\\n9. To make the output, you have to draw a vertical and horizontal line that passes through every teal pixel in the grid. These lines can only pass through black spaces and the pixel it emerges from. The lines should stop when it hits the edge of the grid or another teal pixel.\\\\n10. To make the output, you need to draw a line of teal dots on the black grid, connecting isolated teal dots vertically or horizontally. However, the newly added dots should not cross through other preexisting dots. The preexisting isolated teal dots are used as the start and end points for the new lines. Cross junctions should be avoided.\\\\n11. To make the output, you have to connect (from left to right in a straight line) all present teal colored cells while remaining on their row. The lines should be filled with teal colored cells.\\\\n12. The transformation consists of highlighting the shortest path between two teal squares by replacing black cells in between with teal cells. If there is one teal square, draw the highlighted path down until it hits another teal square. If there are two teal squares on the same row or column, draw a line between them.\\\\n13. To make the output, you have to trace a straight horizontal line starting from the 8 (teal) located on the left side to the 8 (teal) located on the right side of the grid. Do the same for the positions where 8 (teal) is located on the top and bottom. Essentially, join the pairs of 8 top-bottom or left-right on the same line. If there are no pairs, leave the single 8 (teal) as is.\\\\n14. The transformation pattern involves drawing a straight horizontal line in teal color from the leftmost colored cell to the rightmost colored cell in each row of the input. If there\\\\\\'s no colored cell in a row, leave it as it is. If there is only one colored cell in a row, no line is drawn from it. The line should only be drawn when there are at least two teal cells in a row and they should be the leftmost and rightmost teal colored cells. The drawn line should only replace black cells and not the teal cells between them in the row.\\\\n15. To make the output, you have to connect each teal dots vertically and horizontally to form straight lines. No diagonal line is needed to be connected. If the teal dots form a \"T\" shape, you need to fill in the intersecting lines.   So, in general, the transformation is forming vertical and horizontal lines by connecting teal dots in the input grid.\\\\n16. To make the output, you have to locate the teal pixels and draw a line of teal pixels from the left-most teal pixel to the right-most pixel in the same row. Repeat this operation for each row that contains at least one teal pixel.\\\\n17. Step 1: Identify the first teal tile from top to bottom and then to the right.  Step 2: Locate the last teal tile to the right. Step 3: Make all tiles within this range teal. Step 4: Repeat this step for each row containing a teal tile in the input grid.  This process essentially \"connects\" teal tile horizontally on each same row as initial teal tile.\\\\n18. To transform the grid, you should connect the teal colored dots vertically and horizontally, creating joined lines of teal color. However, do not cross connect the lines between the dots. Therefore, the lines of teal color are formed within each segmented area, horizontally from left to right, and vertically from top to bottom but do not cross through other segmented regions.\\\\n19. To make the output, you draw a vertical line from the top-most teal dot to the bottom-most teal dot. Also, draw a horizontal line from the left-most teal dot to the right-most teal dot. The dots that were not on these lines will be discarded. In other words, the output includes two overlapping teal lines that form a plus shape, with its center being the intersection of these two lines.\\\\n20. To make the output, connect the teal cells horizontally and vertically to form continuous lines. If there is a single blue cell, no connection is needed. You may think of it as connecting the teal cells using the shortest paths while only traveling horizontally and vertically.\\\\n21. To make the output, identify the teal dots which are positioned at similar distances from the borders in two different sides. Form a line with teal color connecting those dots. Repeat this process until all identified pairs of teal dots have been connected. The connecting lines should not intersect through a third dot. If a third dot exists between two identified dots, skip connecting these dots.\\\\n22. To make the output, you have to find the pattern in the form of cross made by the teal cells in the input grid. The transformation is such that it fills the row and column that forms the horizontal and vertical part of the cross with teal, leaves the meeting point as it is, and converts the rest of cells in the grid to black.\\\\n23. To make the output, you have to connect each cluster of teal-colored cells with a straight line of the same color. The new cells in the line should be colored teal (8). The line extends from the leftmost to the rightmost cells of each cluster in a row-wise manner. Then, you fill in any black cells that are in the same column and lie between the row of the topmost cell and the row of the bottommost cell in each cluster. All the other cells that are not part of these lines remain black.\\\\n24. To make the output, you have to link each teal dot to every other teal dot that is in the same row or column, but only if there are no other dots between them, creating a line. More specifically, if there are two teal dots in the same row (or column), you transform all the black cells between them into teal cells (only if those cells do not have a teal dot either above or below them when connecting dots in the same row, or to the left or the right when in the same column). The changed cells are only those between the two teal cells and not beyond them. The rest of the grid remains the same.\\\\n25. To make the output, you have to follow a certain pattern, which seems to be that you have to connect all colored cells with the same colored stripe if they are on the same row or column. The lines connecting the cells are drawn exclusively horizontally or vertically.   In simpler words, you draw a horizontal or vertical line of same color through black cells if there is a colored cell in the same row or column, stopping when it encounters another colored cell or the grid edge.\\\\n26. To make the output, you have to draw a teal line from each non-black square to the non-black square which is the closest in the same row or column. The line should be drawn within the row or column which contains the starting, non-black square. If there isn\\\\\\'t any non-black square in the same row or column, no operation is performed.\\\\n27. In the output, the teal cells are connected to each other with more teal cells if they are on the same column or row and there is no other teal cell in their path. The new teal cells should also be connected to the closest border of the grid, if the border is in the path of connection. The other cases remain the same as the input; black cells are treated as obstacles.\\\\n28. To make the output, you have to determine the line of teal boxes connecting the dots from left to right. If the teal dot lies on row x, row x+1 and row x-1 extend teal boxes out from the dot on both sides up to other teal dots in the row above or below or to the border of the grid. The placement of the teal boxes extend only horizontally and neither upwards nor downwards.\\\\n29. To make the output, you have to connect colored dots which are in the same position in columns and rows. Start from the leftmost or topmost dot and draw a line horizontally or vertically to the right or downwards. But exclude the ones lying on the line or column with single dot. Do not draw lines from the rightmost or bottommost dot.\\\\n30. To transform the input into output, identify clusters with teal cells (8). Extend these clusters both horizontally and vertically until they hit another cluster or the boundary of the grid. The clusters are extended only through the black cells(0), they replace blacks (0) with teal (8) until the other cluster or the edge of the grid is reached.\\\\n31. To generate the output grid, locate the teal dots in the input grid. Create a continuous vertical teal line from the topmost teal dot in a column to the bottommost teal dot. If there are teal dots side by side in a row, create a continuous teal line from the leftmost teal dot to the rightmost teal dot. Fill the green lines in all the possible vertical and horizontal directions until reaching another teal dot or the grid boundary.\\\\n32. To make the output, you have to transform every empty black cell on the cross-line shaped path (Including horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines) between every pair of teal cells on the same line or diagonal into teal as well.\\\\n33. To make the output, you have to connect each teal dot with others that are located on the same row. The line drawn to connect the dots should also be teal. If a teal dot does not have another one within the same row, it will be left as it is.\\\\n34. To make the output, you have to draw horizontal lines between the teal dots. If a single dot is present in the center of a line, extend the line to the next teal dot or until it hits the boarder of the grid. If no dots are present on one side of the grid, disregard that side and just focus on extending the lines to the remaining sides of the grid.\\\\n35. To make the output, draw a vertical line that passes through each teal dot from top to bottom.  Also, connect all teal dots horizontally forming a line (contiguous series of teal dots) along the row that contains the right-most teal dot. Fill any remaining cells with black.\\\\n36. To make the output, you have to draw a vertical line on the first observed teal cell from the top, continuing down the grid until another teal cell in the same column is encountered. From there, a horizontal line should be drawn to the right until reaching another teal cell. The line ends if another teal cell is detected or if it reaches the edge of the grid. The lines drawn should consist of cells with teal color.\\\\n37. To get the output, starting from the initial teal square, color all squares in between two teal squares in the same column or row. If in a row or column, there is only one teal square, fill all squares below this square until another teal square or the edge of the grid is reached.\\\\n38. To make the output, you need to draw teal lines between all the teal dots in the grid. If a teal dot doesn\\\\\\'t have a corresponding teal dot at the end of the grid in the same row or column, don\\\\\\'t draw a line starting from this dot.\\\\n39. Connect the teal points in a straight line horizontally between each teal points if they are located on the same row. Similarly, connect teal points in a straight line vertically between each teal points if they are located on the same column. If a teal point is alone on a row or column, it remains alone in the corresponding output grid.\\\\n40. The transformation is based on lines between the teal dots. For each two teal dots that are on the same row or the same column, add a teal line to connect them. If there is only one teal dot on a row or a column, leave it as is.\\\\n41. To make the output, you have to imagine a vertical and horizontal line that connects every teal cell. Turf these imaginary lines also in teal in the output grid. Fill out the cells in-between these lines with teal if there is a teal cell that separates those teal cells.\\\\n42. To make the output, you trace lines of teal pixels to connect the ones currently on the same vertical or horizontal line in the input. You will be left with horizontal or vertical teal lines with no spaces in between their pixels.\\\\n43. All the teal cells in each row will be connected by a horizontal line of teal cells. If there is only one teal cell in a row, no change is made.   For pairs of teal cells that are vertically aligned across multiple rows, a vertical line of teal cells is drawn to connect them. If the cells are aligned but there are intervening cells filled with a color other than black, the vertical line will not be drawn. If there\\\\\\'s only one teal cell in that column, no line is drawn.   Finally, if a teal cell is part of both a horizontal and a vertical line, all cells in the intersection between the vertical line and horizontal line are turned to teal. It forms a cross or T-like formation of teal cells, with the original teal cells at the centre.\\\\n44. To make the output, you have to look for the teal colors in each row. For any row that contains at least one teal cell, you have to connect all teal cells horizontally with teal color line. Imagine that you are drawing a straight line from the left-most teal cell to the right-most teal one. The line should pass over all white cells in between, but it will not affect any cells above or below the current line.\\\\n45. To make the output, you have to connect the teal squares with a line of teal, if in a same row or column, they are separated by black cells. At least two teal squares in the same row or column are required for a line to be created. The original position of the teal squares are preserved in the output.\\\\n46. To make the output, you need to \\\\\\'connect\\\\\\' teal dots if they are in a straight line in any direction (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal), filling in all the spaces between them with teal as well. When there is no direct connection, the layout remains as it is.\\\\n47. To make the output, you have to connect each pair of teal cells horizontally and vertically by more teal cells, thus creating a path. All other cells remain black. For the input grids that have teal cells in diagonal positions, with one cell in the center, create a \"+\" sign connecting the center cell with the four cells in each side of the grid via teal cells.\\\\n48. To make the output, you have to draw lines with teal color from one point to other points which are in the same row or column. If there is only one point in the row or column, no lines should be drawn.\\\\n49. To make the output, you have to draw lines connecting all teal cells that are on the same row or column. Fill the shortest path with teal cells from one teal cell to another on the same row or column, but the path is only valid if there are no other teal cells interrupting the path. If a cell already has a teal number, do not overwrite it.\\\\n50. To make the output grid, if there are teal squares in the same row or column, you fill in the spaces between them with teal squares. If there is only one teal colored square in a row or column, do not add any additional teal colored squares. All other squares stay the same as the input. Thus the transformation draws horizontal and vertical lines using the teal squares present in the input grid.\\\\n51. To make the output, you have to trace lines from existing teal dots to the nearest teal dot in the right or down direction (does not count diagonally). Fill these lines with teal color (8). If there is no teal in that direction, leave it black. Repeat this process for all the teal dots. When a teal line reaches another dot, it stops. So a teal line can branch into two. This creates a web-like pattern.\\\\n52. To make the output, you have to connect the teal dots with a teal line running horizontally and vertically. The line will run between the furthest points in both dimensions, effectively forming the largest possible rectangle with teal color between them.\\\\n53. To make the output, you have to connect the teal pixels with a uninterrupted vertical and horizontal line of teal pixels. Do this by filling in teal pixels between the existing teal pixels in each row and column until you reach a black pixel or the edge of the grid.\\\\n54. To make the output, you have to draw vertical and horizontal lines using the teal color, that goes from each dot to another in 4 directions (up, down, left, right) until it hits the edge of the grid or another dot. If it hits another dot, draw the line to connect them and stop.\\\\n55. To transform the input grid to the output grid, identify any teal cells that form a vertical or horizontal line with one another. Any black cells that are in between these teal cells should be transformed to teal. This essentially \"draws\" a line connecting the teal cells. No changes are made to any other cells. If only one teal cell is present, no changes should be made to the grid.\\\\n56. To transform the grid, start at the earliest teal number from the top of the grid. Fill in teal cells moving downwards until you reach another teal cell. Once there, continue to fill out to the left and right until you reach a teal cell in those directions. Continue this process until no more teal cells are available in the grid.\\\\n57. The teal color dots on the input grid act as markers or nodes. To get the output, draw a vertical \\\\\\'line\\\\\\' of teals passing through every dot, starting from the top dot in the column until the bottom dot in the same column. Similarly, draw a horizontal \\\\\\'line\\\\\\' of teal passing through every dot, starting from the leftmost dot in the row to the rightmost in the same row. These \\\\\\'lines\\\\\\' will divide the grid into distinct compartments. If a compartment has no teal dots in it, leave it as it is (black). If a compartment has one teal dot in it, color the rest of the compartment teal, excluding the dot.\\\\n58. To make the output, you have to draw a vertical teal line from every teal dot in the fourth row from the bottom up to the top teal dot in the column; create a horizontal teal line from every teal dot in the fourth column from the left to the rightmost teal dot in the row. Make everything else black.\\\\n59. To make the output, you have to  connect the teal vertices diagonally and fill in the rectangle created by the vertices with teal.\\\\n60. To create the output, consider every teal dot in the input as a \\\\\\'node\\\\\\' and draw a line of teal dots connecting the nodes that are in the same row or same column. If a node is alone on its row and column, it stays undisturbed. If there are multiple nodes in a single row or column, connect all of them using a line of teal dots along that row or column. Remainder of the grid stays black.\\\\n61. To transform the grid, locate all teal cells. For each set of neighboring teal cells on a line (either a row or column), color the cells black which connect them in a straight line. This operation does not apply if there are no neighboring teal cells on the same row or column.\\\\n62. To make the output, connect the teal points in their respective columns and rows. If there is only one point in a column or row, leave it as it is. If there are at least two points in a column or row, fill in all the points between them with teal as well, effectively creating a line.\\\\n63. The cells of the input grid containing teal squares act as seeds. They spread color vertically and horizontally until the spread is interrupted by another teal-colored cell or by the edge of the grid whichever is closer. The final effect forms a cross or a plus sign shape of teal color connecting the dispersed teal cells.\\\\n64. To make the output, you have to connect all the teal squares with a vertical or horizontal line, depending on their arrangement. So if two teal squares are in the same column, connect them with a vertical line of teal squares, and if two teal squares are in the same row, connect them with a horizontal line of teal squares. The line should go from the first teal square to the last one in their respective row or column.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "After analyzing the rules, they can be categorized into eight distinct categories as follows:\n\nCategory 1: Rules that involve connecting teal pixels/dots/cells/squares in a straight line, either horizontally or vertically, without any specific direction.\n- Rules: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 20, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 33, 34, 39, 40, 42, 44, 45, 48, 49, 50, 55, 62, 64.\n\nCategory 2: Rules that involve creating a rectangle or square shape by connecting teal pixels/dots/cells/squares.\n- Rules: 1, 52.\n\nCategory 3: Rules that involve connecting teal pixels/dots/cells/squares in a straight line, either horizontally or vertically, with a specific direction (left to right or top to bottom).\n- Rules: 13, 18, 28, 29, 31, 36, 37, 38, 43, 46, 51, 54, 56, 58, 60.\n\nCategory 4: Rules that involve connecting teal pixels/dots/cells/squares in a straight line, either horizontally or vertically, and filling in the spaces between them.\n- Rules: 9, 10, 12, 19, 21, 22, 30, 32, 35, 41, 47, 53, 57, 59, 61, 63.\n\nCategory 5: Rules that involve connecting teal pixels/dots/cells/squares in a straight line, either horizontally or vertically, and extending the line to the edge of the grid or until it hits another teal pixel/dot/cell/square.\n- Rules: 34, 51, 54, 56.\n\nCategory 6: Rules that involve connecting teal pixels/dots/cells/squares in a straight line, either horizontally or vertically, and creating a cross or T-like formation.\n- Rules: 15, 43, 47, 63.\n\nCategory 7: Rules that involve connecting teal pixels/dots/cells/squares in a straight line, either horizontally or vertically, and avoiding intersections or cross junctions.\n- Rules: 10, 21, 24, 25, 26, 27, 32, 41, 49, 57, 59, 61.\n\nCategory 8: Rules that involve connecting teal pixels/dots/cells/squares in a straight line, either horizontally or vertically, and filling in the entire row or column.\n- Rules: 14, 16, 17, 23, 44, 50, 53, 64.\n\nSynthesized Rules:\n\n1.

To make the output, you have to shift the first four colored squares from the middle row above it. Then, replace the middle row strictly from the third column to where the sequence ends with a replicated sequence of colors from the middle row. Replicate the first four colored squares from the middle row in the rows below it hence creating a sequence above and below the middle row in parallel.\\\\n2. To make the output, you have to reflect the vertical color arrangement to the horizontal arrangement on the same row the colors start vertically. Additionally, mirror that same vertical arrangement both above and below the position where the colors started in the input grid.\\\\n3. To make the output, you have to identify the row with multiple colors and duplicate its pattern across the length of the row. Above and below this row, copy the individual colors to all corresponding columns.\\\\n4. To make the output, you have to reflect the ordered colors in the vertical middle axis of the grid till it is filled. However, before that, reverse the order of the colored squares.\\\\n5. The transformation involves the central row and the two rows just above and below it. The array of colored cells in the central row (let\\'s call it the \\'target array\\') is mirrored in all three central rows, each time replacing a single preceding color cell. Following this, the central color pattern repeats from left to right until the end of each row in the grid. On the rows above and below this central part, the color sequence from the \\'target array\\' is rotated for each row, in a pattern where they shift up one row at a time. The topmost tile of the sequence is moved to the bottom after each shift. This creates a rolling color sequence effect above and below the central part of the output grid.\\\\n6. To make the output, you have to keep the top and bottom black rows the same. In the middle, there\\'s a set of colored squares that should be rotated around the middle square (which contains the most different colors). The rotation is counterclockwise. Then, the pattern of colors in the middle square is repeated across the whole width of that row, identical to the last square right before the rotation.\\\\n7. To create the output grid, first rotate the input string of colored numbers to be in the correct order. Fill in the entire row that features the diagonal sequence with this ordered string, repeating until the row is filled. Then replicate the vertical sequence of colored numbers (in correct order) above and below this filled row, maintaining their vertical alignment. Leave the rest of the grid as 0s.\\\\n8. To make the output, you have to firstly make the row of colored elements mirror itself above and below. Secondly, rotate every line of four colors in the grid clockwise. This will make an original color sequence of (for example) teal, green, red, and blue turn into blue, teal, green, red.\\\\n9. To make the output, you have to roll down the cells from the column to match the order in the row, and then repeat the cells from the row to fill the rest of the middle column, and also fill the columns on the left and right of the middle column to the end.\\\\n10. The pattern involves rotating the isolated colored shape by 90 degrees clockwise, moving it to the top. Then, the row of colors that originally contained the shape fills the entire row in the grid as a repeating pattern. The rest of the grid remains black.\\\\n11. The transformation pattern distinguishes a single-column pattern which repeats horizontally. To obtain the output grid from the input grid, mirror the single-column pattern vertically and expand this reversed pattern by repeating it in its row until the row ends. Leave the remaining parts of the grid as they were in the input grid.\\\\n12. To make the output, you have to the colored boxes four times to the right in the row where they are located. Also for each black box above or below a colored box, replace them with the same colored box but shifted one color up. For example, if beneath a green box there is a black box, replace it with a teal box. For the yellow box which is at the top, shift it to green. Follow this order of boxes when shifting: red -> yellow -> teal -> green -> red.\\\\n13. To make the output, you have to shift up the entire sequence of colors such that it is centered around the sequence in the middle. This color sequence is then repeated to fill in the middle (horizontally), The pattern of the sequence is maintained.\\\\n14. To make the output, you have to repeat the pattern of the colored line horizontally. The pattern repeats to the right of the initial pattern. Also, the initial pattern gets reversed above and below the repeated pattern.\\\\n15. The pattern repeats both above and below the given sequence, in alternating order starting from the beginning of the sequence. In the middle row, the sequence repeats contiguous to itself for the width of the grid.\\\\n16. To make the output, you have to make a copy of the sequence of colored cells from the input and move this sequence above and below the original sequence, for as many rows as the sequence contains different colors. Additionally, the sequence of colors should be repeated horizontally in the row where the original sequence was for as many times as the sequence contains colors. Also, the copied sequences above and below the main sequence should be transposed, so that the first color in the sequence is closest to the main sequence.\\\\n17. The transformation involves the following steps:  1. You first need to find a pattern of colored squares which starts from left to right at the center of the grid. The sequence of the pattern will be repeated to fill the entire row in the output.  2. Write the pattern in the cells right above and right below the center in the output grid.  3. You then need to reverse this pattern and write it in the cells two cells above and two cells below the center in the output grid.  4. Repeat this writing and reversing of the pattern for as many cells as exist above and below the center in the output grid.   Remember that black cells represents the background and should be treated as empty cells.\\\\n18. To make the output, you have to keep all color squares the same with the exception of the central row. In the central row, you need to repeat the sequence of the colors from left to right till the end of the row. Also, above and below the central row, you have to copy the color pattern in columns.\\\\n19. To make the output, you need to reverse the order of colored numbers in the line by rotating it 180 degrees. Furthermore, the numbers should be repeated across the grid in the row where the line ends. The sequence should not exceed the grid limit and the process should be replicated horizontally, maintaining the order of the sequence across the row.\\\\n20. To make the output, you have to slide the small pattern to the right until it ends up on the other end of the row. After that, repeat the colored pattern in the row continuously (from left to right) until the end of the row. Finally, mirror the pattern above and below the row where the initial pattern was found.\\\\n21. To make the output, find the color pattern in the input grid. On the output grid, above and below this pattern, cells in the same column should inherit the color of the corresponding cell in the pattern. For the row that contains the color pattern, it should repeat this pattern to the right until the end of the grid.\\\\n22. To make the output, you have to find the sequence of colors in the colored image from left to right, top to bottom. Then you vertically repeat this sequence starting from the middle above and below till the edge of grid.\\\\n23. To make the output, you have to take the colors in the cluster and flip them vertically. Then, repeat the flipped cluster to the right until you run out of space in the row. The isolated colored cell should also be replicated in the cells above, using the colors from the flipped cluster but only one color per row. If you run out of colors from the cluster, start again from the first color.\\\\n24. To transform the grid, mirror the sequence of numbers across both the horizontal and vertical axis of the grid. This process also flips the order of the sequence. For instance, if the sequence in the input was 8,3,2, then the output sequence both above and below it will be 2,3,8. This pattern of repetition is to be followed for every sequence found in the grid.\\\\n25. To make the output, you have to read the vertical figure from the input grid from bottom to top and left to right if there are more colors in the same row, creating a sequence of colors. Then, you repeat this sequence horizontally across the middle row of the output grid. Also, you should take each color from the sequence and fill its corresponding cell in the columns above and below the middle row. The rest of the grid remains black.\\\\n26. Any line or column that intersects with this figure at the bottom in that straight row of color is filled entirely with pixel colors that match the tower in order, repeated over the entire row or column, respectively. The rest of the grid remains black.\\\\n27. To make the output, you have to first replicate the color sequence throughout all cells in its row and then a mirror copy of the sequence is placed in the corresponding rows of both halves of the grid.\\\\n28. To make the output, you have to:  1. Reflect the pattern of colors from the central horizontal line to the rows both above and below it. 2. Then copy this reflected pattern along the same central line. Repeat the pattern until it fills all of the empty cells in the central row.\\\\n29. To make the output, you have to reflect the sequence of colors in the staircase both horizontally and vertically, filling the entire row both above and below the original colored staircase. This results in the staircase sequence being mirrored both vertically and horizontally, creating a pattern across the entire width of the grid.\\\\n30. To make the output, you have to reverse the arrow\\'s color sequence and expand the arrow to the right until it hits the grid\\'s border. The arrowhead squares just above and below the arrow itself also follow this pattern. The rest of the grid remains the same. The new arrow should point in the right direction.\\\\n31. To make the output, you have to take the sequence of colors from the colors line in the input and create a sequence pattern repeating this sequence exactly after the color line. The colors above the repeating sequence in output grid should be mirrored colors from the bottom side of color line in the input grid and vice versa - the colors below the repeating sequence in the output grid should be mirrored colors from the top side of color line in the input grid.\\\\n32. To make the output, you have to mirror the color sequence above the original color line on all cells above the original color line. The mirrored color sequence is repeated from left to right starting with the first available cell on the left until the non-black line that was previously above the sequence is reached. Maintain the original color line. Transformations applied above the color line are also mirrored below the color line.\\\\n33. To make the output, you should first identify the pattern formed by the colored cells in the middle of the input grid. This pattern should then be spread to the right equal to the width of the input grid. Finally, mirror this pattern above and below the expanded pattern, creating a line of mirrored patterns in the middle of the grid.\\\\n34. To make the output, you have to examine the central row of numbers. Preserve it as it is. The row of numbers should then be copied and mirrored above and below it until it reaches the previous black cell. Once the mirrored sequence has been created, keep rotating the sequence of numbers in individual rows starting from the central row. For rows above the central row, rotate the sequence to the right. For rows below the central row, rotate the sequence to the left. In the end, the grid should appear symmetrical with rows of numbers rotating around the central row.\\\\n35. To transform the grid, take the pattern from the input grid and fill in the black spaces in the grid. First, rotate the pattern 90 degrees clockwise. Then, repeat this pattern until it fills the grid from left to right. The rest of the grid remains black.\\\\n36. To make the output, you have to pick the repeating sequence of colors from the bottom to the top and replicate it horizontally multiple times. The replicated sequence should start from 1 cell above the first cell of the sequence and end at 1 cell below the last cell. The rest of the grid should be copied from the input as is.\\\\n37. The transformation consists of three steps: 1. Rotate the entire colored sequence 90 degrees counterclockwise. 2. Repeat the sequence from the starting position horizontally to the right until it reaches the edge of the grid. 3. In the vertical center line, the remaining cells inherit the color of the cell above them, with the exception of the sequence line, which remains unchanged.\\\\n38. To make the output, you have to repeat the color sequence horizontally in the row where the sequence originally appeared. Also, repeating colors in the 4th column should be revamped to follow the order of colors in the horizontal sequence, each color appearing once every four cells.\\\\n39. To make the output, first repeat the diagonal sequence horizontally across the entire grid. Then, construct color sequences both above and below the horizontal sequence, matching the colors in the diagonal sequence within the segment above and below the sequence. Each segment is a reversed copy of the diagonal sequence, with the first color of the segment corresponding to the last color of the diagonal sequence, and the last color of the segment corresponding to the first color of the diagonal sequence.\\\\n40. In order to create the output grid, separate original grid into a top and bottom half using the horizontal line. Then mirror the sequence of the top half over the sequence in the horizontal line color sequence to the bottom half, and vice versa. This results in a mirrored image where the top half of the vertical line is a reflection of the bottom half, and vice versa. In the horizontal line, repeat the sequence found in the horizontal line from the input grid.\\\\n41. To make the output, you have to repeat the color sequence of each individual cell in the strip from the start to the end of the grid row by row. Then the color sequence is repeated vertically, above and below the strip, alternating the sequence from tail to head and from head to tail.\\\\n42. To get the output, start by finding the line of color squares. Then, starting at the top, have a blank line and then replicate the line of color squares in reverse order up to the previous color squares line. Also, the line of color squares should be repeated horizontally to fill the whole line of the grid. After the line of color squares, continue with the pattern of replicating the color squares in reverse order with blank lines in between.\\\\n43. To make the output, you have to mirror the colored vertical line above and below it till it hits the middle of the grid. For the row that has the most colorful squares in it, you should repeat the sequence from left to right until you fill the entire row. It\\'s kind of like spreading the colors outwardly from the vertical line.\\\\n44. To make the output, you have to first reverse the order of these colored squares vertically. After that, the line should be extended until it reaches the end of the row following the now reversed color sequence. The rest of the grid remains black.\\\\n45. The colored blocks in the row are mirrored above and below their original row. Draw copies of the blocks in the row above and below, on black squares, maintaining the same spacing. The color order of the blocks is also reversed when mirrored. Finally, repeat the series of colored blocks, from left to right, on the row where the blocks originally appeared.\\\\n46. The transformation moves the four colors to the top of the grid and then continues to repeat the four-color pattern in a horizontal pattern until reaching the end of the line. The single colors that were displaced by the four-color pattern are moved to the next available line. Repeat this across the entire grid.\\\\n47. To make the output, you have to take the sequence of colors from the middle of the input grid (excluding the first black squares from both ends if there are any), and then copy and paste this sequence repeatedly across the middle of the output grid to fill the whole row. Then, copy the sequence of colors, rotate it 90 degrees clockwise, and place it above and below the filled horizontal line in reverse, until the grid is filled or until you reach the same number of rows as in the input. The sequence should be repeated as necessary.\\\\n48. To make the output, you have to copy the colored line upwards and downwards in a mirror-like fashion until the grid is filled out. Moreover, the sequence of colors from the middle row should be repeated throughout the entire row.\\\\n49. To make the output, you have to replicate the vertical sequence of colors in the center line as a horizontal sequence, on the line that contains more than one color (which is the line that has a different color sequence). The vertical sequence of colors above and below the horizontal sequence matches the colors of the original vertical sequence in a descending order starting from the last color in the sequence.\\\\n50. To make the output, you have to keep the colorful numbers above and below the middle line, then repeatedly copy the sequence of colorful numbers from the middle line into the rest of the line and carry this out for the entire middle line.\\\\n51. To make the output, look at the vertical line of numbers in the input grid and figure out the series. We rotate this series such that the first number in the series moves to the end and the rest are shifted up by one place, repeating the series. Meanwhile, take the center row and expand it to the sides - repeating the series of numbers horizontally throughout the row. Other rows above and below the center in the output grid should be the rotated series from the input.\\\\n52. The rule for making the output from the input is repeating the sequence of colors in the lower half of the grid across the whole width of its row. Above and below this row repeat the colors from the upper half of the input, in the same order and also centered. The rows between the new repeating sequences and the centered sequences on top and bottom should remain empty.\\\\n53. To make the output, you have to firstly, reverse the order of squares in the vertical colored line (reverse their vertical positioning). Secondly, copy the horizontal line of colored squares before and after the line itself until filling the entire grid horizontally on the line\\'s horizontal level. For the squares outside of this pattern, keep them as they are.\\\\n54. To get from the input to the output grid, first identify the vertical line of colors in the input grid. In the output grid, this line will be re-arranged slightly. It appears that colors should be in the same order they appear in the line, starting with the second color after the top color of the input line. Around the middle of the grid, and directly under the original sequence, copy the color sequence horizontally. Continue to copy this sequence to fill up the width of the grid. Above and below this main sequence, copy the re-ordered vertical line across. The order should be the same as the vertical line but with the previously first color placed at the end of the line.\\\\n55. To make the output, you have to firstly reverse the order of the colored grid cells found in the row of the input grid. Then, for the lines directly before and after the now reversed row of cells, change every third cell of the row (starting from the left and only where the cell is black) to the corresponding color found in the reversed row. Repeat these steps for each sequence of colored grid cells found in the input.\\\\n56. The transformation involves the column or row with more colors in it. You have to reflect the column or row with the most color points vertically, if it is positioned vertically in the input, and then replicate its pattern from left to right covering the other columns. For the case when this pattern is positioned horizontally in the input, you have to reflect it horizontally and then replicate the pattern from top to bottom covering the other rows.\\\\n57. To make the output, you have to identify and repeat the color sequence in the first half of the grid. The color sequence in the grid always starts with the color at the bottom and goes upwards. The repeated sequence should be placed starting on the 3rd row from the bottom right, and repeat it in the same order horizontally across the entire width of the grid. The colors above and below this repeated sequence should be an inverse sequence of the original colored sequence.\\\\n58. To make the output, you have to locate the starting points and replicate the series of colors seen on the x-axis, just underneath the last of the starting colors. This sequence is then repeated from left to right till the edge of the grid. The rest of the grid (including the cells above the sequence line) is then filled with a mirrored image of the cells below the sequence line.\\\\n59. To make the output, you have to reflect the sequence colors vertically and repeat the sequence colors horizontally as much as possible while still fitting within the outlines of the grid.\\\\n60. To create the output grid, identify the sequence of colored blocks in the input grid. Write this sequence above and below its initial position with the colors reversed. Additionally, repeat this sequence horizontally for the entire width of the grid where the input sequence first appears.   Therefore, this transformation involves recognizing a sequence, mirroring it vertically within the columns above and below, and duplicating it for the entire width of the row that originally contains the sequence.\\\\n61. To make the output, you have to read the sequence of colored dots from top to bottom and repeat this sequence from left to right in the middle row. The sequence above and below the middle row should be mirrored along the row of the sequence horizontally. The remaining cells stay black.\\\\n62. To make the output, you have to rotate the middle line 90 degrees clockwise, so the previous vertical line of colors now runs horizontally. The original color sequence should now repeat across the entire row. The color squares above and below the horizontal sequence should be replaced by repeating the rotated sequence in reverse order.\\\\n\"}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "After analyzing the rules, they can be categorized into eight distinct categories based on their similarities:\n\n1.

For each category, synthesize the rules into a single, specific rule that combines the ideas of all rules in that category, while clearly differentiating it from the other categories.\\\\nThe new rule should be as specific as possible, following the format of the given rules.\\\\nThe new rule should be applicable without any information from the original rules - i.e. it should be standalone.\\\\n\\\\nRules:\\\\n1. To generate the output grid, the area on the right side of the grey line in the input grid is removed. The resulting output grid is only 4 columns wide, and maintains all the colored squares from the input grid on the left side of the grey line, with the black background unchanged.\\\\n2. To make the output, you should extract the middle 4x4 section of the original grid, oriented in line with the rows and columns of the input grid, but excluding the outer strip of cells surrounding this 4x4 square. Then you rotate the extracted 4x4 sector 45 degrees counter-clockwise so the first row become the last column.\\\\n3. To make the output, you have to exclude the right half of the grid. This means you only keep the left half part of the grid and fill the right half with black cells.\\\\n4. To make the output, you have to remove the right 5 columns. The colors and positions in the rest of the grid must remain the same.\\\\n5. For the output grid, keep the first four columns of the input grid same in their corresponding rows. This includes the grey line. For the remaining columns, copy and reflect the values from the left side of the grey line to the right side of the output grid.\\\\n6. To transform the input into the output, you need to remove the right side of the grid. Then, shift the remaining left side to the right and fill the empty left side with black color.\\\\n7. To make the output, you have to remove all the cells to the right of the grey vertical line on the input grid. The grey vertical line should become the right-most vertical line in the output. No changes are to be made to the cells on the left side of the vertical line or the vertical line itself.\\\\n8. To make the output, you should remove the right side of the square by converting those colored cells and the grey line into a black color. The left image stays the same.\\\\n9. To transform the grid, draw a vertical line at the one third point of the grid from the left side. After dividing it, copy the squares immediately to the right of the grey vertical line, in their respective horizontal positions, into the first column of each row on the left side. Fill the remaining squares in the left part of the grid with black. The right side (two thirds) of the grid remains black.\\\\n10. To make the output, you have to select the first four cells from the rows containing the 5x5 grid of grey cells in the input. The first cell of the output is always black, followed by three cells that replicate the input.\\\\n11. To make the output, any number (except 0) that is adjacent (by edge not corners) to the grey line (which is represented by number 5) is replaced by the number on the left of the grey line. The rest of the layout remains the same. This is similar to copying the colours from the left of the grey line to the immediate right of the grey line.\\\\n12. To make the output, you have to clear the right part of the input grid, leaving only the left part and the grey vertical line in the middle. The right part should be replaced with black cells.\\\\n13. To make the output, you have to copy the first four columns of the input grid to the output grid. The grey line and the colored pattern to the left of it are reproduced in the output. The right part of the grid is removed.\\\\n14. To make the output, you need to remove the right half of the grid, leaving only the left half plus the grey line in middle.\\\\n15. To make the output, you have to shift all colored cells towards gray strip, collapsing the black cells, and keep the middle line.\\\\n16. To make the output, you have to remove the last four columns on the right of the grey line. The result should be that the grey line is at the right edge of the grid.\\\\n17. To make the output, you remove all columns to the right of the vertical line of gray cells.\\\\n18. To make the output, you have to mirror each quadrant along the center line towards the left. In other words, flip the contents of each quadrant onto the left side of the center line. After flipping, the gray line would be the rightmost column.\\\\n19. To make the output, you need to remove the right side of the grey column as well as anything to the right of it. Everything to the left of the grey column and the grey column itself should remain unchanged.\\\\n20. To make the output, you have to take the left half of the input grid and ignore the right half. This includes the grey line. The only thing you\\'re keeping is the 0 to 4th column of the input grid.\\\\n21. To make the output, remove the right half and the middle column of the grid, keeping only the left part. This means that the gray column and everything on right side should be removed and all the colored cells on the left side should remain in place.\\\\n22. To make the output, you have to remove the right half of the input including the middle grey line. The remaining left half becomes the output transformed grid.\\\\n23. To make the output, you should omit the column that has the grey colored line (5) and also the columns to its right. The other columns and their contents remain the same.\\\\n24. To transform the grid, keep the 5 left-most columns and remove the other columns. If a digit is present on the grey line in the input, it should be placed on the right edge of the output.\\\\n25. The pattern uses the grey line as a point of reference, translating all of the colored cells from the right side of the grey line in the input to the left side of the grey line in the output. Black cells are not moved. Precisely, the cells two steps to the right of the grey line in the input become adjacent to the grey line on the left side in the output. Cells four steps to the right become two steps to the left in the output, and so forth.\\\\n26. To make the output, you have to remove the grey bar and all the cells on the right side of this grey bar in the input. You are left with a 10x4 grid which is the output.\\\\n27. To make the output, you have to keep the blocks on the left of the grey line as it is, and remove the symmetric blocks on the right side of the grey line. The grey line then becomes erased (transformed into black).\\\\n28. To make the output, you have to remove everything to the right of the grey column, then remove the grey column itself. In other words, only keep the four columns to the left of the grey column.\\\\n29. To make the output, you have to first divide the input grid by half vertically and then remove the right half, including the grey middle line. Finally, each colored square stays at the same position as the input grid.\\\\n30. The map receives the color of the cells for the first four columns until the grey column. The boundary of the transformation cuts vertically through the center of the grey line. The grey line in the input is removed in the output. The colors of the cells in the output are the reflection of the cells\\' color in the input from the center of the grey line.\\\\n31. To make the output, you have to remove the middle gray column. The resulting grid will be the same in all other respects.\\\\n32. To make the output, you have to eliminate the right 4 columns, then move all cells on the right side to the middle (where the grey cells were), and replace the missing rightmost cells with black.\\\\n33. To make the output, you should conjunct values from the left and right halfs of the input guided by the gray line. Move values at the same position to the output, but omit the grey line. You should only take  numbers from the left half and their counterparts from the right half to make up the output grid of 10x4, essentially removing the grey line the middle and bringing the halves together. If a number in the input does not have its counterpart on the opposite side of the gray line, just put a 0 (black) there.\\\\n34. To make the output, you must remove the right half portion of the grid. This results in the gray strip being displayed rightmost in the grid. Preserving the remaining part of the input as it was.\\\\n35. To get the output, you need to split the input grid vertically in half along the grey line and keep the left side. The width is reduced by half and the grey line is removed.\\\\n36. To make the output, you have to remove the right section of the gray line and adjust the grid size. While transforming, preserve the original positioning of the colored shapes/numbers, fill the rest of the grid with black, and remove the grey line.\\\\n37. The transformation from the input to the output involves cropping. Cut the right 5 columns of the grid and the central column. The pattern shows a yellow vertical line at the center and various colors of horizontal lines on the left, surround by black cells.\\\\n38. To make the output, you have to truncate the input grid to the left of the the gray center line and include the gray center line but do not include anything to its right. So the output is the left half of the input including the gray line.\\\\n39. To make the output, you have to eliminate the last four columns from the right of the input grid. After you complete this step, your resulting grid should be a 10x10 grid with the fifth column still filled with grey boxes.\\\\n40. To create the output, take the left side of the 4 widest color shapes from each side of the gray line then discard the rest of the grid. Keep the gray line in the middle intact. Place the left side on the right and right side on the left to form a new 9x4 grid.\\\\n41. For the transformation, only the two columns on either side of the grey line in the input are retained. Of these two columns, the one that is farthest from the grey line is shifted to the outermost column in the output, whereas the one closer to the grey line remains in the same relative position. In other words, you remove all but the two columns adjacent to the grey cells in the input, flip these two left columns, and preserve their original row placement.\\\\n42. The output should retain the right half of the grid and drop the left half, up to the grey line. This keeps the columns to the right side of the grey line, including the grey line itself. Change any cells that have color 6 to black.\\\\n43. To make the output, you need to cut the grid in half vertically through the grey column. Keep the left half, and remove the right half including the grey column. In the output, the grey column should have been removed. Each row should be shifted two cells to the right to fill the blank cells left by the removed half. Leave the first two columns as black.\\\\n44. To make the output, you have to mirror the right half of the grid onto the left. Everything on the right side (including the grey line) stays unchanged. Everything on the left side gets replaced by a mirror image of the right side. Therefore, the gray line should be exactly in the middle of the output grid, and the two sides of the grid should be symmetrical.\\\\n45. To make the output, you have to remove the last 4 columns of every row. The line of grey characters and the blocks flanking it on the left should remain. The characters to the right of the grey line should be removed.\\\\n46. To transform the input grid into the output grid, start from the gray line and include the four squares to the left of that line. And the grid values on the right of gray line will be ignored. The output grid consists of these cells leaving the gray ones.\\\\n47. A new grid is created by removing the spaces further from the middle, keeping only spaces up to and including the 4th column from the left. The numbers obtained by counting the cells from the left to right on the input grid are transferred to the output grid.\\\\n48. To create the output grid, the half of the input grid that is on the right side of the grey squares (value 5) is removed. The remaining left half grid and the vertical grey squares line are kept as they are.\\\\n49. To make the output, you have to remove all the columns to the right of the grey line.\\\\n50. To make the output, you have to remove columns to the right of the grey line. While doing so, ensure that you leave one column to the left and three to the right of the grey line.\\\\n51. To make the output, first remove the grey line and the right side (3 columns) of the original grid. After that, take the left-hand side (3 columns) of the grid and put it on the right side of the original left-hand side.\\\\n52. To make the output, you would have to compress the grid by eliminating the right side of the grid along the gray line and keeping only on the left of the gray line, with a single column of black cells on the left as a buffer.\\\\n53. To make the output, read the grid divided by the central yellow line and redraw it by removing the right side. The vertical yellow line will be also removed, resulting in a grid with 4 columns and the original number of rows. Colors should be kept in their corresponding original positions.\\\\n54. To make the output, you have to cut out everything right of the grey line. You keep only the grey line and everything left of it. In the output, you should see that the grey line was shifted to the rightmost column.\\\\n55. To make the output, you have to omit the right half of the grid, and shift the left half to cover the entire grid.\\\\n56. To make the output, you have to start from the leftmost column of each row on the grid. In each row, look for the first column that is not black, count the non-grey cells in the column (including it), then record the color of the first non-grey cell in the output grid until you reach 4 cells or complete the column. If the column ends before you reach 4 cells, fill the rest of the cells of the corresponding output row with black. Do this for each row.\\\\n57. To create the output grid, you have to take the left side of the input grid and replace the center grey column with black cells. This process produces a mirror image of the left half of the grid on the right side of the grid, however the colors are not flipped - instead they maintain their original functionality from the input grid.\\\\n58. To make the output, you have to extract the 5th to 8th columns of the input grid. This should include the grey column and the columns to its immediate left and right.\\\\n59. To make the output, you have to remove all columns except for the column immediately to the left of the central grey column. This column should be copied. The rest of the grid should be black.\\\\n60. To make the output, you have to eliminate all colors on the right side of grey center line, and extend the colors from the left side of grey center line to fill the corresponding cells on the right.\\\\n61. To make the output, you have to remove the fifth column (grey color) completely. For the rest of the columns, take the cells on the right side of the grey column and replace the cells on the left side. So, the information on the right is moved to the left. The space on the right, after moving the details to the left, is filled up with black color.\\\\n62. To make the output, you have to cut the input grid along the gray line and discard the right part. The result is the grid with 5 columns on the left of the gray line.\\\\n63. To transform the input grid into the output grid, remove the grey column and the four columns to the right of it. The output grid should consist of the four leftmost columns from the input grid.\\\\n\"}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "After analyzing the rules, they can be categorized into eight distinct categories based on their similarities.

To make the output, you have to perform a 90 degree counter-clockwise rotation on all the color elements while keeping the black cells stationary. The vertical line of colors in the input becomes the horizontal line in the output and the horizontal line in the input becomes the vertical line in the output. The grey cells, if present in the input, are excluded from this transformation.\\\\n7. To make the output, you have to rotate the \\\\\\'t\\\\\\' shape 90 degrees to the left. The grey box always stays on the upper right corner of the shape, so in the output, you should rotate this \\\\\\'t\\\\\\' shape to place grey box on the upper right side of the \\\\\\'t\\\\\\'.\\\\n8. To make the output, you\\\\\\'ll need to rotate the entire grid 90 degrees to the right. After that, the vertical strip in the middle of the grid moves to the very left side of the grid and the horizontal strip moves to the bottom. The colored cells in the right column of the input becomes the top row in the output.\\\\n9. To make the output, move the colored line three blocks left of the right border, remove the grey border, and move the center colored line to be three blocks from the top of the grid.\\\\n10. To form the output grid, shift the whole column of pixels from the fourth column to the third column, and shift the whole fifth row to the seventh row. All other pixels remain black.   Note: The position of the colored pixels in relation to the grid may look different due to the zero-based index. This transformation always moves the color from the 5th column to the 4th column and from the 6th row to the 8th row, regardless if it\\\\\\'s a single pixel, a continuous line, or a sporadic pattern.\\\\n11. To make the output, you have to rotate the entire \"T\" shape 90 degrees counter-clockwise. The grey box in the top right corner of the grid stays still.\\\\n12. To make the output, rotate the entire grid 90 degrees counterclockwise. The vertical colored line should now be horizontal at the top while the horizontal line is vertical on the far right. Ignore the numbers on the right column in the input grid as they seem irrelevant to the transformation.\\\\n13. To make the output, rotate the whole grid 90 degrees to the right. The vertical stripe of colored cells becomes a horizontal stripe, the horizontal line becomes a vertical stripe, and all other cells remain the same.\\\\n14. To obtain the output from input, follow the steps below:  1. Rotate the grid 90 degrees clockwise. 2. Analyze the output grid. The colors still remain the same but positions are changed due to rotation. The cross now appears to be diagonally aligned from top left to bottom right.\\\\n15. To make the output, first, the grid needs to be mirrored horizontally. After this, the column consisting of colored cells on the right will be moved to the fourth column from the left, leaving only black cells in its original position. Following this, the horizontal line consisting of colored cells will also be moved up one position. The color of the cells remains the same between the input and output.\\\\n16. Flip the position of the colored cells within each row, so the straight line of colored cells is now at the left side of the grid (first column), and the horizontal line of colored cells is at the bottom, moving to the left side. Black cells should remain in their positions when the color cells are moved. The scattered Grey cells are gone in the output.\\\\n17. To make the output, you have to vertically flip the input grid. Therefore, the column, originally on the right side, gets placed on the left side and the horizontal row, originally placed somewhere in the upper half gets placed symmetrically somewhere in the lower half of the grid. The rest of the cells stay black.\\\\n18. To make the output, you have to shift the vertical line of colored cells three spaces to the left and the horizontal line of colored cells three spaces up. The grey cells in the vertical line on the far right of the input grid, if any, should be ignored.\\\\n19. To generate the output, you have to shift the vertical line of colored cells three positions to the left and the horizontal stripe of colored cells three positions up. Leave every other cell black (unchanged).\\\\n20. To make the output, you have to interpret the grid as a compass. The horizontal line must go to the east (right side of the grid) and the two vertical lines (colored and grey) must go to the north (top of the grid). The intersection of the two colored lines will now be at the north-east corner of the grid.\\\\n21. To form the output grid, move the vertical line to the far left of the grid. The horizontal line of color blocks should be shifted up by one row. The result is a \\\\\\'L\\\\\\' shaped pattern with color blocks at the top and left edges of the grid.\\\\n22. To make the output, the vertical colored line is moved to the fourth column from the left. The colored horizontal line is moved to the once place of where the horizontal colored line was in the input grid. If there was a partial vertical line on the far right of the grid in the input, it is removed in the output grid.\\\\n23. To make the output, you have to move the colored lines and middle block. The top lines move down one space, the middle block moves up, and the bottom lines move down. In other words, you shift the whole grid except the bottom line upward by 1. The bottom row of color 2 will become the top row.\\\\n24. To make the output, you have to move the column of colored cells to 4th position from left while the row of the same colored cells should be moved to the fourth position from top. The rest of the cells should remain black. Also, ignore any grey cell.\\\\n25. To transform the input to the output. You have to rotate the entire grid 90 degrees clockwise. The row that was filled with a colored number will become a column on the left side, and the column with the same colored number will be spread throughout the rightmost column of the output grid.\\\\n26. To make the output grid, you have to rotate the entire input grid 90 degrees clockwise. This would result in the column of colored input cells moving to the 7th row from the top, and the row of the colored cells ending up at the 4th column from the left.\\\\n27. To make the output, move the colored vertical line from the 4th column of the input grid to the 3rd column of the output grid. Also, swap the row containing the colored horizontal line with the row that is 7 positions below the original position. Lastly, remove any differently colored single cells.\\\\n28. Move the colored line that divides the matrix into quarters from the 4th column to the 3rd column. Then move the line that goes through the center of the matrix from the 7th small square from the top to the 8th small square from the top. Essentially, we are shifting the colored cross upwards and to the left, keeping all the other positions the same as in the input.\\\\n29. To make the output, you have to shift the colored vertical line to the first column of the grid. Then, move the colored horizontal line to the third row from the top of the grid. The rest of the units will remain in their original position.\\\\n30. To make the output, rotate the entire grid clockwise by 90 degrees. This will set the gray squares at the bottom of the grid, rotate the cross, and the cross color remains the same.\\\\n31. The transformation pattern involves moving the color that forms the vertical line towards the left border of the grid whilst keeping the same order vertically. The colorful horizontal line still appears attached to the vertical colored line but it is now located at the bottom.\\\\n32. To make the output, you have to rotate the whole grid 90 degrees to the right. The vertical stripe becomes a horizontal stripe and the horizontal stripe becomes a vertical stripe in the mirror image way. The color of the stripes and the cell remains the same.\\\\n33. The transformation is a shift in the colored lines. The vertical colored line is moved to the third column from the left side of the grid. The horizontal colored line that originally was on the 7th row is moved to the 4th row from the top in the output. After the lines have been moved, all other 5s are removed and replaced with 0s.\\\\n34. To make the output, you have to rotate the whole grid 90 degrees counterclockwise. The colored line will move from center to the left edge and the horizontal line shifts its position accordingly. The last column and gray squares remain unchanged.\\\\n35. To create the output grid, you must rotate the input grid 90 degrees anticlockwise. The bold row should always be closer to the origin after rotation.\\\\n36. To transform the grid, you swap the vertical and horizontal color filled line in the grid and keep the rest of the squares as they are. This should lead to the colored lines intersecting at the same point where they did in the original grid, only their directions have been swapped.\\\\n37. To transform from the input grid to output grid, rotate the grid counter clockwise by 90 degrees or you can view this as swapping the x and y axes.\\\\n38. To make the output, you have to rotate the input grid 90 degrees to the left. The color of the vertical and the horizontal line remains the same. The grey cell is ignored during the rotation and does not appear in the output grid.\\\\n39. The transformation involves rotating the entire grid 90 degrees clockwise. This means the vertical line in the input becomes a horizontal line in the top row of the output, while in the input the horizontal line becomes the vertical line in the first column of the output. All other cells should be black or filled with zeros.\\\\n40. To make the output, you have to rotate the whole grid two times. In other words, the entire grid has been flipped vertically and horizontally.\\\\n41. To make the output, you will need to shift the position of the line separating the grid\\\\\\'s top and bottom halves. The colored line will move position to separate the two halves in the third row from the top (as if reflected). Additionally, any colored cells in the top right corner of the input grid disappear in the output grid.\\\\n42. To make the output, rotate the entire grid 90 degrees clockwise. The result should be a line of coloured cells running from left to right, sometimes extending downwards to the bottom edge of the grid, and a line of coloured cells going from top to bottom in the middle of the grid.\\\\n43. To make the output, you rotate the entire grid 90 degrees counterclockwise. In this process the vertical lines become horizontal lines and the horizontal line becomes a vertical line.\\\\n44. To create the output, rotate the input grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise, and maintain all colors. The vertical far-right line in the input becomes the top horizontal line in the output, the middle horizontal line in the input becomes the vertical line in the middle of the output, and the vertical line fourth from left in the input becomes the bottom horizontal line in the output. The grey cells on the right in the input appear on top in the output.\\\\n45. To make the output, you have to switch the colored vertical and horizontal line positions. The vertical line from the fourth column moves to the fourth row, and any colored horizontal line moves to the fourth column. All other parts of the grid remain black (0).\\\\n46. To make the output, shift the entire vertical colored line two spaces to the left. Then, shift the entire horizontal colored line two spaces upwards. The output grid now consists of a vertical line of colored cells shifted two spaces to the left from its original position and a horizontal line of colored cells shifted upwards two spaces from its original position.\\\\n47. To make the output, you have to rotate the grid ninety degrees to the left. So, the colored line in the middle becomes vertical and the small colored square line goes to the left.\\\\n48. The transformation involves rotating the initial grid 90 degrees counterclockwise. This places the color column at the top and the color bar at the right side of the output grid. The rotation doesn\\\\\\'t change color of the cells, it\\\\\\'s only moving cells to new locations following the rotation rule. The gray cells, if any, do not follow this rule and remain at the initial positions.\\\\n49. To make the output, rotate the input grid 270 degrees anticlockwise. This shifts the initially vertical line to the fourth row from the top and the initially horizontal line moves to the first column from the left.\\\\n50. To make the output, you have to swap the positions of the vertical and horizontal stripes. The vertical stripe should go to the fourth column from the left and the horizontal stripe should move to the fourth row from the top. The position of the single point isn\\\\\\'t changed.\\\\n51. To make the output, rotate the input grid 90 degrees clockwise, in a way that all the original colored columns move to the top.\\\\n52. To make the output, you have to rotate the whole grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise. This places the vertical colored line on the left side of the grid, and the horizontal colored line somewhere in the grid. And when the shape contains gray cells, after rotation this line is placed in the top area of the grid without touching the colored line.\\\\n53. To make the output, you have to move the usually centered colored line, one position to the left. The entire colored line should be moved to the eighth row from the top. The spaces in the rest of the rows previously occupied by colored blocks should become black. The grey block in the rightmost column is removed entirely.\\\\n54. To make the output, you simply rotate the grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise. All the positions of the colored cells will be in the same row or column as the original, but their positions are mirror translated.\\\\n55. The transformation to reach the output grid from the input consists on rotating the whole grid 90 degrees clockwise.\\\\n56. To create the output grid, we need to swap the locations of the single colored row and column in the input grid. The single colored column in the 4th position from the left of the input grid should be moved to the 4th position from the top in the output grid. Similarly, the colored row in the 7th position from the top in the input grid should be moved to the 7th position from the left in the output grid. The remaining cells stay black.\\\\n57. The transformation involves moving the column of colored blocks in the input to the fourth column from the left and the color-filled row to the eighth row from the top in the output, ignoring the columns with grey blocks. All other blocks retain their original values.\\\\n58. To make the output, you have to rotate the grid 90 degrees to the left. The horizontal line of color in the middle of the input becomes a vertical line of color on the right side of the output, and the vertical line of color in the input becomes a horizontal line in the middle of the output.\\\\n59. To make the output, you invert the position of the lines. The colored line that was in the 4th column in the input grid is moved to 7th column in the output grid and the line that was in the 7th column in the input grid is moved to the 4th column of the output grid.\\\\n60. To make the output, you have to rotate the colored and grey strips 90 degrees counter-clockwise around the center of the grid. The vertical colored strip rotates to become a horizontal colored strip that runs across the top of the grid. The horizontal grey strip rotates to become a vertical grey strip that runs down the left edge of the grid. The grey strip that sometimes appears on the right edge of the original grid would not be rotated and does not exist in the final output.\\\\n61. To generate the output from the input, the vertical color bar needs to be shifted three columns to the left, while the horizontal color bar is shifted three rows upwards. The small instance of the other color also remains in the top right corner. This task represents a linear transformation of the grid.\\\\n62. To make the output, you have to shift the colored line to the first non-black position along the same axis (either rows or columns, depending on the orientation in the input) and move the middle row/column of the input to where the original colored line was placed. The gray line in the input does not impact the transformation and can be ignored.\\\\n63. To make the output, you have to move the line of color cells from the middle row to the middle column and the color boxes reverse their position with the central line. The boxes remain in their respective rows, while the color of the line does not change.\\\\n64. To make the output, you have to move the diagonal stripe from top middle to bottom left. The band of colored cells are also moved from middle row to the forth row from the top.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "After analyzing the rules, they can be categorized into eight distinct categories based on their similarities:\n\nCategory 1: Rules involving 90 degrees rotation (either clockwise or counterclockwise)\nCategory 2: Rules involving shifting of colored lines (either vertical or horizontal)\nCategory 3: Rules involving swapping of positions of colored lines\nCategory 4: Rules involving flipping of the grid (either vertically or horizontally)\nCategory 5: Rules involving specific movements of colored lines to certain positions\nCategory 6: Rules involving rotation of specific shapes (like 'T' shape)\nCategory 7: Rules involving ignoring or removing certain cells (like grey cells)\nCategory 8: Rules involving complex transformations (like mirroring and then moving)\n\nNow, synthesizing the rules into a single, specific rule for each category:\n\n1.

To make the output, you have to replace every black square from the green digit \"5\" in the input that intersects with the grey digit \"2\" with a green square.\\\\n2. To transform the input to the output, we need to change the position of the red cells depending on their row and column. If the column of red cell in the input is an odd number, it should be moved two cells upwards in the output. If the location is on an even-numbered row or column, it will stay in place. Empty cells (black) and grey cells remain unchanged.\\\\n3. To make the output, you have to change the colors of the cells. Specifically, for the bottom half of the grid, change all the black cells to red. The top half should remain unchanged.\\\\n4. To make the output arrange the cells in this way. Whenever a grey cell is surrounded by red cells on either side on the same row, turn those surrounded grey cells to red. Make sure black cells are not filled in the grid. Keep black and red cells as they are.\\\\n5. To make the output, replace any row that is preceded immediately above by a row containing black cells, completely with red cells. Leave all the other values untouched.\\\\n6. To make the output, you need to replace teal cells in each row with the same pattern or distribution of red cells in the corresponding row above. If there is no corresponding row above (like in the first row), or there are no red cells in the corresponding row above, you keep the cells as it is. Hence, the transformation patter is to copy the pattern of red cells to teal cells one row below.\\\\n7. The transformation consists of changing all the black blocks that are located directly above the red blocks in the input grid into red blocks in the output grid. Balcks (number 0) that are in the same column above reds (number 2) turn into reds, the rest remains unchanged.\\\\n8. The transformation is done by copying all the blue and black cells as is into the output grid, and replacing each red cell that is directly above a blue cell with a blue cell in the output. If a red cell is not directly above a blue cell, it remains as red in the output.\\\\n9. To get the output, you should replace every occurrence of the number 0 that is surrounded by 5 on its both vertical or horizontal sides by the number 2. All other values should remain the same.\\\\n10. To form the output grid, fill the \"red\" region of your array. If there is a black square hindering your line, just skip it and continue on the next adjacent blue column until the red region is filled. Leave everything else the same.\\\\n11. To make the output, you have to look at the 6th row of the input grid. If it is red and surrounded by grey on either side, change all the gray squares in that column to red. If it is gray and surrounded by red, change all the red squares in that column to gray.\\\\n12. To make the output, you have to follow a simple rule: If a cell is black and the cell directly below it is red, change the cell color from black to grey. Retain all other cells as they are.\\\\n13. To make the output, you have to count the number of red squares in each row. If the sum of red squares is equal or more than 2, replace all black squares with red in that row. Otherwise, keep the input as it is.\\\\n14. The transformation rule involves identifying any rows that are completely filled with grey (5), excluding any rows that also contain red (2) cells. For these identified rows, the transformation rule involves replacing any yellow (0) cells in the equivalent output row with red (2). All other cells in the output grid should remain the same as in the input.\\\\n15. To make the output, you have to scan each row from bottom to top. Fill each grey cell in a row with red cell until a black cell is detected. Once a black cell is detected, stop filling that row with red, and move to the top row. Repeat this process for each row until the last row is filled.\\\\n16. To make the output, you must replace all black squares in the 3rd row, 2nd column, and diagonal from top left to bottom right of the reddish half-square in the middle (not including the gray row that separates the two halves) with gray squares.\\\\n17. To make the output, you have to apply a transformation rule to the middle section of the grid. Starting from the 6th row to the 8th row, transform each black cell (0) to red (2). Note that grey (5) cells and existing red (2) cells are not changed.\\\\n18. To make the output, you have to follow the rule: wherever there is a column of red squares, replace all the black squares with red in that row until you reach the red square or hitt the end of the row.\\\\n19. To make the output, you have to replace the grey (5) in the 5th column with red (2) from the start till it reaches the red segment in the 6th row. If a red segment is not present in the 6th row then the 5th column remains as it is in the input.\\\\n20. To make the output, you have to turn all cells to the left and right of a red cell (horizontally adjacent) also into red.\\\\n21. To make the output, you have to replace every 3rd column from left to right, which is full of orange cells, with red cells, if below that column there is a single red cell anywhere in the row. Else leave it as it is.\\\\n22. To make the output, you have to scan each row from the top to bottom. When you encounter a row filled with only grey and black, you maintain it as it is in the output grid. However, when you go to the next row after a row colored with red is encountered, replace the black boxes in that row with red. Continue this process through the entire grid.\\\\n23. To make the output, we are primarily looking at the 2x2 grids containing the number 2 (in red). If a grey box is found bordering any side of this mini 2x2 grid, it is changed to red (number 2). All other boxes remain unchanged. This pattern follows the logic of the color red (number 2) spreading out to adjacent grey cells.\\\\n24. To produce the output, you must look for cells or rows that match the color distribution on the sixth row exactly. If a cell or row matches with the sixth row, change the grey cells within these matched cells or rows to red.\\\\n25. To make the output, you have to replace any sequence of a grey box followed by a black box followed by a grey box in the horizontal direction with a sequence of a red box in the first place of the previous grey box followed by a black box followed by a grey box. Check it from left to right.\\\\n26. To make the output, you have to replace all black boxes in the bottom half grid with red. Upper half of the grid remains unaffected.\\\\n27. To make the output, you have to replace all the adjacent grey blocks that are on the right side of the red block in the same row with red. If there is no red block in the row, leave the row as it is. This pattern applies until the next red block is encountered within the same row. Check each row individually.\\\\n28. To make the output, locate grey cells surrounded by black cells on their left and right. Change the color of these grey cells and the black cells beneath them to red. Repeat this for each row in the grid.\\\\n29. To make the output, you have to follow a pattern in the input. Find the gray line (horizontal, vertical or diagonal) that splits the grid into two equal parts. Make all black cells directly below (or to the right if the line is diagonal) of this gray line into red cells. Turn the rest of the black cells in the grid into gray cells.\\\\n30. To make the output, you have to change the color of black cells that are directly above a red cell to teal. All other cells remain the same color.\\\\n31. To make the output, you have to loop over every square in the grid. Follow these rules: If that square is gray, turn it red. If it\\\\\\'s red in the input, leave it red in the output. If it\\\\\\'s black in the input, leave it black in the output. In simpler terms, change every gray square to red and leave the other ones as they are.\\\\n32. We notice that the grid\\\\\\'s top half and bottom half seem to be related, so we have to focus on the lower part. To get the output from the input, replace every black square (0) in the bottom 5x10 half of the grid with a red square (2) if and only if the corresponding square in the exact same position in the top 5x10 half is grey (5). Do not change the squares in the top half.\\\\n33. To make the output, change all black cells to red from the top to the red line (inclusive). The other cells below the red line and the red line itself remain unchanged. This transformation should be applied over each column.\\\\n34. To make the output, you have to replace every consecutive block of three or more red squares in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) with orange squares. The rest of the squares retain their colors.\\\\n35. To make the output, look at the area after the gray horizontal line (bottom area). Go row by row, if the red cells form a line from the left to the right, replace the black cells in that same row with red cells. Keep all other cells the same whether in the upper or lower part.\\\\n36. To make the output, you have to keep all red line as is. Find each line of gray cells above the red line from the left border, replace it, and the black cells beneath it up to the red line with black cells until you run out of black or reach the red line. Do not replace other cells. Repeat this operation for each graph in the input grid.\\\\n37. To make the output, you have to locate the cells which are adjacent to a red (2) cell in the input grid. In these cells, change the color to grey (5) to red (2). The change only happens if the cell is adjacent horizontally or vertically to a red cell, not diagonally. The rest of the cells remain unchanged.\\\\n38. To make the output, you have to fill in the black squares with red, using the following strategy. If the black square has a grey or red neighbor diagonally to the left above or below, color the square red.\\\\n39. To make the output, you have to replace the black cells in the row above the red line with red, and keep the other cells in the row identical to the input grid. For the bottom part of the grid, replace all black diamonds to red if the cell that is above them, and just below the red line, is grey.\\\\n40. To make the output, you have to follow the following rule: In the green squares, if the box at the corresponding position in the red rectangle is black, replace the green box with a red one. Leave all other colors as they are.\\\\n41. To make the output, you have to replace all grey tiles above the red line with red tiles. So, the grey tiles on the blue area above the red line should be replaced with red. The rest of the grid should remain as it is.\\\\n42. To make the output, you have to replace all the gray cells (5) that are to the left of the red line (2) including the cells on the line with red (2).\\\\n43. To make the output, replace all black boxes in the 6th vertical strip (counting from the left) with red boxes, instead of just having red boxes in the strip halfway. So, essentially this transformation is changing all black boxes to red boxes in a selected vertical strip. This strip starts from the 1st red box at the top in the input, down to the last red box.\\\\n44. To transform each grid, take the sixth row and recreate it in every row that is above it. For all other rows, keep the same pattern as in the input.\\\\n45. To make the output, you have to replace all the black numbers on the top of the red line with grey numbers on the output. Similarly, replace all the grey numbers below the red line in the input with black on the output. The red line should remain unaltered.\\\\n46. To create the output grid, you\\\\\\'ll have to observe the rows filled with the number 2 (red). Identify how each digit in this row impacts the grid - it converts all 0\\\\\\'s to 2 from its position up to row 4 (inclusive), while keeping the number 5 (gray) unchanged. Apply this rule for all red rows.\\\\n47. To make the output, you have to replace all the black cells located below the red line with red. The rest of the grid remains the same.\\\\n48. To make the output, you have to replace every third vertically placed color 5 (grey) cell on the left side of the red line from the top to middle with color 2 (red). And also replace every second color 5 (grey) cell on right side of the red line from the middle to the bottom with color 2 (red). The pattern doesn\\\\\\'t affect any black cells.\\\\n49. To make the output, you have to replace the gray cells with red ones in the lower right 3x3 subgrid of the upper 5x5 square. Similarly, replace the gray cells with red ones in the lower 3x3 subgrid of the lower 5x5 square. All other cells remain the same.\\\\n50. To make the output, you have to replace all the blue cells that are vertically and/or horizontally adjacent to a red cell with a red cell. Keep all other cells as they are.\\\\n51. To make the output, you have to replace each black cell that is either above, below, or right next to a red cell with a red cell while leaving the rest of the cells the same.\\\\n52. To make the output, you have to change the black squares in the bottom half to red. The green squares in the top half remain green, the yellow line remains unchanged, and the red squares in the bottom half remain red.\\\\n53. To create the output grid, change the color of the third horizontal line, if any, within all 5x5 subgrids of the lower 5x10 rectangle from grey to violet. Other components and colors in the grid remain unaffected.\\\\n54. To make the output, you have to change the color of the boxes in the red square (bottom square) based on the corresponding boxes in the blue square (top square). If the box in the blue square is black, change the corresponding box in the red square to green. If the blue box is not black, leave the red box as it is.\\\\n55. To make the output, you have to find the teal cells in the grid and then turn all the black cells that are immediately left of a teal cell into teal cells as well. This transformation needs to be performed only for the cells below the central horizontal line. For cells above the line, no changes should be made.\\\\n56. The transformation rule involves replacing some gray cells with red cells while maintaining the same overall layout of the grids. Specifically, the gray cells that are horizontally adjacent to black cells are replaced with red cells. Other cells remain unchanged in the output grid.   In simpler terms, if a grey cell in the input grid has a black cell to its left or right, it changes into a red cell in the output.\\\\n57. To make the output, you have to observe the row containing red cells in the bottom half of the grid only. The red cells in the corresponding columns needs to be replaced by the red color in the first row of bottom half. The black cells do not change.\\\\n58. To make the output, you have to perform the operation only on the red cells. If a red cell is surrounded (either vertically or horizontally) by two black cells, it remains red. If a red cell is surrounded by at least one grey cell, it changes to blue. All grey and black cells remain the same.\\\\n59. To transform the input to the output, every gray square (\\\\\\'5\\\\\\') that immediately follows a red square vertically (\\\\\\'2\\\\\\') must be changed to red.\\\\n60. To make the output, you have to identify black cells in the bottom section of the input grid (i.e., from the middle line down to the bottom) and replace them with red cells. The top section of the grid remains the same as in the input.\\\\n61. To change the input to the output, substitute some of the blue cells with red cells in the lower half of the grid. If the neighboring cell in the left direction in the upper half of the grid is green, then replace the corresponding blue cell with a red cell in the lower half of the grid.\\\\n62. For transforming the input grid to the output grid, identify the third color that separates the two blocks. Replace the black squares in the blocks with the third color keeping the distribution of the original colors in the blocks intact.\\\\n63. To make the output, you have to change all the black squares in the second half of the grid (below the red row) to red. In other words, if the square is black and it\\\\\\'s in the second half of the grid, change it to red. Else, keep it as it is.\\\\n64. To make the output, you have to replace any 0s in the row immediately above the row of 2s with 2s. The same has to be done for two rows above the row of 2s as well. All other elements in the grid remain the same.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "Category 1: Rules involving color changes based on position relative to other colors\n- Rule 1\n- Rule 4\n- Rule 7\n- Rule 8\n- Rule 27\n- Rule 28\n- Rule 30\n- Rule 37\n- Rule 38\n- Rule 50\n- Rule 51\n- Rule 55\n- Rule 56\n- Rule 58\n- Rule 59\n\nNew Rule: To make the output, identify cells of a specific color that are adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to cells of another color.

For each category, synthesize the rules into a single, specific rule that combines the ideas of all rules in that category, while clearly differentiating it from the other categories.\\\\nThe new rule should be as specific as possible, following the format of the given rules.\\\\nThe new rule should be applicable without any information from the original rules - i.e. it should be standalone.\\\\n\\\\nRules:\\\\n1. To make the output, for each blue cell in the input, create a vertical green band that spans across the middle 3 rows of the grid and is centered on the row in which the original blue cell is placed. All other cells remain black.\\\\n2. To produce the output, draw a green cross centered on the position of the blue dot(s) in the input. The cross should extend 1 cell horizontally and vertically from the center point. Leave all other cells unchanged. If there are multiple blue dots, apply this rule to each.\\\\n3. To make the output, you have to transform the blue cells into cross like structures made of same blue cell along with an additional 5 green cells that form a \"+\" sign centered at the location of the blue cell of the cross. If there is not enough space for the full cross, you just add as many green cells as possible without extending the edge of the grid. The rest of the cells remain black.\\\\n4. To create the output, you keep the same layout as the input grid. For any blue cell in the input, you add a green diamond shape around it in the output. The diamond has a radius of 1 unit. Keep the central blue cell as is and the rest of the diamond should be filled with green. This diamond should replace any black cells, but not replace any other colors. If no blue cell exist, keep all cells as is.\\\\n5. To make the output, you have to form a diamond shape centered around each blue cell from the input grid. The \\\\\\'diamond\\\\\\' consists of the central blue cell, and green cells positioned above, below and to the left of the blue cell. This maintains the symmetry of the blue cells.\\\\n6. To make the output, you have to look at the blue cells in the input grid. Keep the blue cells at the same positions in the output grid. Then, for each blue cell in the input, add green cells at each side of it, excluding the diagonal positions around it (i.e., only north, south, east, and west) in the output. If there\\\\\\'s already a blue or green cell, keep it as is.\\\\n7. To make the output, you have to identify a blue cell in the input grid and then, on the corresponding output grid, turn the cells that are one step orthogonally adjacent to the blue cell into green cells; the blue cell remains blue. If there are two blue cells that do not line up vertically or horizontally, apply the same rule for each blue cell independently on the output grid.\\\\n8. To make the output, for each blue point in the input, you have to place a green cross (with a centered blue point used as the center of the cross). The green cross should be 3 cells high and 3 cells wide. The placement of the cross doesn\\\\\\'t change the surrounding cells that aren\\\\\\'t a part of the cross.\\\\n9. To make the output, you have to fill green color around the blue box in the shape of a \\\\\\'+\\\\\\' sign, if enough space is available. If blue box is on the far left or right, make the \\\\\\'+\\\\\\'. shape as much as possible without extending beyond the grid boundaries.\\\\n10. To make the output, you have to replace the middle rows between the blue boxes with a 3x3 green box that is centrally-aligned vertically and horizontally on the line connecting the two blue boxes. The green box\\\\\\'s shape and placement does not depend on the number or spacing of blue points. If blue boxes do not exist in the input, the output remains the same as the input.\\\\n11. To make the output, you have to replace the set of four squares perpendicular to a blue square with green squares. The blue square acts as the center of the four squares, with one square below, one above, one at right and one at left, forming a cross shape. All other squares remain the same as in the input grid.\\\\n12. To make the output, you have to connect any two blue dots on the input with a green line through the center of the grid. The line drawn is orthogonal, going firstly from the center of the grid to the mid-point between the two blue dots, and then from this mid-point to the blue dot closest to the center. If there is only one blue dot on the input, create a similar green orthogonal path leading from the central cell to the blue dot. The other blue and black cells are not changed.\\\\n13. To make the output, you have to identify the blue dots in the input grid. For each blue dot, add green dots to its left, right, above and below except in cases where these points outlie the grid dimensions. If there is already an existing blue dot in those locations, don\\\\\\'t overwrite it with a green dot. The rest of the grid remains black.\\\\n14. To create the output grid, transform the input grid by adding a green dot for every adjacent cell (not diagonal) to a blue dot. A cell is considered adjacent if it is directly to the left, right, above, or below the cell containing the blue dot. The blue dots remain unchanged, and any cells not adjacent to a blue dot or containing a blue dot remain as black.\\\\n15. To make the output, for each blue cell in the input, replace it with a blue cell in the output and replace the cells immediately to the left, right, and above the blue cell with green cells if those positions are not already colored in the input.\\\\n16. To make the output, you have to locate the two blue cells in the input grid. Green cells are placed in a pattern around the blue cell. The pattern involves filling up the cell right to the left and one cell above and below the blue cell if there are no boundaries preventing it. The blue cells in the output are kept at the same position as in the input.\\\\n17. To make the output, you have to create a green diamond shape in the grid positioned around the blue cells. The diamond should be contained in the 3x3 area centered at the position of the blue cell. The blue cell should also remain in the same position in the output grid. The other cells in the output grid remain the same.\\\\n18. To make the output, you need to find the blue spots. Each blue spot in the grid has become the center of a green plus sign. The plus sign is composed of the center blue spot and two green spots above it, two below it, two on the left, and two on the right. The remaining grid cells should be black.\\\\n19. To get the output, mark the cells directly above, below, and to the right of any blue cell with green color while keeping the blue cells as they are. Note that only those cells are colored green which are inside the grid\\\\\\'s boundaries. Other cells remain black.\\\\n20. To make the output, you have to take each blue square and draw a green plus symbol in the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right, but not diagonally) centered around each blue square. The size of the plus symbol should be 3x3 (meaning one square extends in each direction from the central blue square).\\\\n21. To make the output, you have to create a green square cross centered on the position of each blue square. The size of the cross should be 5 squares, with its arms extending 2 squares in all four directions from the central square. If an arm of the cross passes over a blue square, it should remain blue.\\\\n22. To make the output, you need to observe the position of each blue cell in the input grid. For each blue cell, fill the four immediate neighbors (above, below, left, right) of the blue cell with green in the output grid. If the neighbor is out of grid bounds, ignore it. Keep all other cells the same as in the input grid.\\\\n23. The transformation rule for input to the output grid is to draw a green diamond around each blue cell in the grid. The blue cell is the center of the diamond. The diamond extends in N, E, W, S directions to a maximum length of 1 cell where N= North= Upward, E= East= Right, W= West= Left and S= South= Downward.  In case a diamond\\\\\\'s point extends outside the grid margin, it should be ignored and not represented in the output grid. The diamond is made of green cells, and the center remains blue. Rest of the cells remain black.\\\\n24. To make the output, you have to identify each blue dot and change the dot and its surrounding squares (directly left, right, above, and below) into green color while the rest of the grid remains the same. If the blue dot is on the edge where it doesn\\\\\\'t have a surrounding square on one or two sides, you only change the available surrounding squares.\\\\n25. To make the output, you have to find the blue squares and place a green cross (plus sign) at the location of each blue square.  The cross should be formed with the blue square as the center, and a green square on each of its four sides (up, down, left, right). If the blue square is positioned at the edge of the grid and a part of the green cross would be outside the grid, just ignore that part and fill in the rest of the cross. The locations where there are no blue squares or parts of a green cross should remain black.\\\\n26. To make the output, you have to start from each blue pixel in the input and color the 8 nearest neighbors in green. However, these neighboring green pixels should not overwrite any existing blue pixel. Also, these green pixels must fall within the bounds of the input grid, i.e., no coloring is done if the neighboring positions fall outside the grid.\\\\n27. To make the output, you have to locate the blue cell in the input grid. In the output grid, keep the original blue cell/s but also add a green cell to each of the four cardinal directions (north, south, east, west) of the original blue cell, if space allows. This can be imagined as a plus (\\\\\\'+\\\\\\') formation centered at the location of the original blue cell. All other cells remain black.\\\\n28. To make the output, you have to find the blue pixel in the input grid. Then, in the output grid, you place this pixel at its original location, but you also add green pixels above, below and to the left of the blue pixel, if they are within the grid.\\\\n29. To make the output, you have to replace black cells in the input that are surrounded by blue cells (either horizontally or vertically) with green ones. All other cells will remain the same as the input including blue cells. Which means, blue cells serves as origin for green cells on its left, right, top and down, not on diagonals. Single isolated green cells won\\\\\\'t appear.\\\\n30. If a blue square is present in a row or column, create a green cross (consisting of vertical and horizontal line of 3 green cells centered at the middle cell of the row or column containing the blue square). If more than one blue square is present, superimpose the green crosses.\\\\n31. To make the output, you have to locate each blue square in the input then fill in a green cross shape (made up of 5 squares) with the blue square in the center. Leave the rest of the grid black.\\\\n32. To make the output you have to create a green cross centered on each blue dot. The length of the arms of the cross should be 2. The blue dots remain in the output grid. Leave all other cells black.\\\\n33. To make the output, you have to find the blue cells in the input grid. For each blue cell, create a green diamond shape that is 3 cells wide and 3 cells tall, centered at the position of the blue cell. The blue cell itself stays in its place in the output. If a blue cell appears on the edge of the grid where a full diamond cannot be formed, just form as much of the diamond as you can within the grid\\\\\\'s boundaries.\\\\n34. To create the corresponding output grid, you have to draw a diagonal cross the blue cells with green cells. The cross should be made such that it covers the surrounding cells, passing through the corresponding blue cell in the diagonal direction only. Other cells remain unchanged.\\\\n35. To make the output, you have to draw a green diamond shape around the blue blocks. Dark cells remain dark. The horizontal and vertical diameters of the diamond are five cells long, with the blue block located at the center of the diamond.\\\\n36. Connect the blue cells with a green line along the vertical middle axis. The green line begins from a blue cell, goes through the central line, and ends at the symmetrical blue cell. In cases where there is only a single blue cell on the central line, the green line should be vertically symmetric around this central line.\\\\n37. The transformation involves the two blue cells in the input grid. A green square is drawn in the output at a location that is the approximate centre of the two blue cells. This square has its sides parallel to the borders of the grid, and it has side length three, including the original blue cells if they are part of the newly formed square. The rest of the cells do not change positions or color.\\\\n38. To make the output, you have to connect the blue dots in the input with a green line without leaving the grid. The green line goes from a blue dot to the another blue dot. If there is only one blue dot, the green line should be a \"+\" centered on this dot. If there are two blue dots, the green line should connect them by the shortest path, either vertically, horizontally or diagonally.\\\\n39. To make the output, you have to identify the row with the blue box(es). In the output, the boxes above, below, and two spaces to the right and left of the blue box, turn to green boxes. The blue box stays the same. The rest of the grid remains black.\\\\n40. To transform the input grid to the output grid, you have to create a green square in the middle aligned with the blue cells. The positions around the green square should remain black. Furthermore, the green square should be symmetrically located between the blue cell horizontally or vertically that is the total number of cells between the blue cells divided by 2 should be used to position the green square. The green square should be surrounded by black cells. All other cells remain black.\\\\n41. To make the output, you have to find all cells that are vertically between two blue cells and transform them into green cells. Both the blue cells and the green cells that are transformed should be in the same column. The blue cells remain blue in the output grid. The rest of the cells remain black.\\\\n42. To make the output, you have to find the blue squares and put a green cross in the grid. The center of the cross should be the position of the blue square, extending one cell to the left, right, up, and down. If a blue square is on the grid edge, avoid going beyond the grid edge. Other squares remain black.\\\\n43. To make the output, you have to mirror the blue squares vertically and horizontally and fill the intersecting paths with green color. The mirrored square will be created at an equal distance from the edge of the grid as in the input on the other side.\\\\n44. To make the output, you have to draw a 3x3 green square centering around the same row of the blue cell(s) and at the center column of the grid. Each blue cell gets replaced with a green cell while all other cells remain unchanged.\\\\n45. To make the output, you have to identify the position of the blue cells in the grid. Around every blue cell, form a small square of green cells if there are not any obstacles of other cells. The green square should be of size 3x3 with the original blue cell in its center, and the cells of the square should be adjacent to each other, maintaining the previous position of the blue cell. Keep the rest of the grid the same.\\\\n46. To make the output, you have to create a green cross around each blue square. The intersection of the cross should be on the blue square, and the arms of the cross should extend one square in each direction (up, down, left, right). Keep the remaining squares the same as in the input.\\\\n47. To make the output, you have to find every blue square in input grid. When you found it, you have to position a green square cross of size 3x3 with the center at the blue square (If there is no boundary constraint). If such a green cross would go beyond the grid boundary, then only plot the possible green square within the grid. Please note, the blue squares should remain in the original places in output grid.\\\\n48. To make the output, you have to replace the black cells surrounding the blue cells in a cross pattern (up, down, left, right) with green cells.\\\\n49. To make the output, you need to find the blue cells in the input grid. In every side of the blue cell, a new green cell is placed, forming a green cross. The original blue cells retain their color in the output grid. The remaining cells should follow the color they had in the input grid.\\\\n50. To make the output, you have to draw a green diamond shape centered on each of the blue squares. The size of the diamond is such that it extends two cells horizontally and vertically from the blue square (if possible, without exceeding the boundary of the grid). The diamond draws over the blue square, replacing it with green.\\\\n51. To make the output, each blue cell in the input spreads itself orthogonally by 1 unit to become a block of green cells (3x3), replacing black cells it encounters with green ones, this block may protrude beyond the 10x10 grid. The blue cell remains in the center of the green block.\\\\n52. To transform the grid, look for the cells containing the blue square, for these cells, fill in an \\\\\\'X\\\\\\' shape made out of green squares such that the \\\\\\'X\\\\\\' is centered on the blue square. The \\\\\\'X\\\\\\' should not overlap any other colored squares and should only cover black squares. If multiple \\\\\\'X\\\\\\' shapes are drawn, they should not overlap one another and should be centered on their corresponding blue square.\\\\n53. To make the output grid, first identify the blue cells in the input grid. The transformation rule involves creating a green cross centered at the middle of the two blue cells, or around the single blue cell. This cross is composed of a row and a column of green cells that intersect at the center point. The length of the arms of the cross expands until they hit a blue pixel or the border. The blue cells remain in their positions.\\\\n54. To make the output, you have to find the blue squares (1s) in the input. Draw a green (3) \"plus\" sign on the grid - extending to the left, right, up, and down from the blue square, but not diagonally. The length of the arms of this plus sign should be 2 squares. If the blue square is on the border of the grid, just draw the portion of the plus sign that fits within the grid. The blue squares remain unchanged.\\\\n55. The output is obtained by forming a shape that represents a square rotated by 45 degrees around the original blue dots. This shape is made up of green cells whose center is the position of the blue dot. The square rotated by 45 degrees has 3x3 cells, where the middle ones around the central cell are colored green. The original blue dots are kept in the output grid.\\\\n56. To make the output, you have to expand the blue cross into a larger green cross. The green cross should have the same center as the blue cross and it should extend one square further in each direction, up, down, left, right. Keep the blue cross unchanged.\\\\n57. To make the output, find the blue points in the input grid and place a green plus sign centered at each blue point location in the grid. The plus sign is formed by coloring the cells directly above, below, left, and right of the blue point.\\\\n58. To make the output, you have to replace the black cells adjacent to the blue cells with green cells. The adjacency is both horizontally and vertically but not diagonally. All other cells remain the same.\\\\n59. To make the output, you need to form a 3x3 cross around the blue dots on the grid. The center of the cross corresponds to the location of the blue dot and the cross is given a green color. If two crosses intersect, the overlapping area carries the color of the cross that is formed last.\\\\n60. To make the output, you have to form a green cross (+ shape) extending through the entire grid, centered at the mean position of the blue cells. The blue cells remain unchanged.\\\\n61. To make the output, you have to find all the blue cells in the grid. For each blue cell convert the existing cell along with the cells immediately to the left, right , top and bottom to green. If the cell is on edge, convert only available cells. Keep the other cells as black.\\\\n62. The transformation occurs only around the blue cells from the input grid. The first thing to notice is that the blue cells will remain in the same place in the output as in the input. Then, directly above, below, and to the left and right of these blue cells change to green cells. The rest of the cells remain black.\\\\n63. To make the output, you have to first locate the blue pixels. Then draw a green cross centered on each blue pixel. The length of the cross\\\\\\'s arms should be 2 pixels. Remember to not overwrite the original blue pixels with green.\\\\n64. To make the output, you have to look for the blue pixels. Now create a plus sign (\\\\\\'+\\\\\\') shape made up of green pixels horizontally and vertically with the blue pixel at the center. The length of the arms of this plus sign is one less than the shortest distance from the blue pixel to the boundary of the grid, in either the horizontal or vertical direction.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "Category 1: Rules that involve creating a green cross centered on blue cells.\n- Synthesized Rule: To make the output, identify the blue cells in the input grid.

For each category, synthesize the rules into a single, specific rule that combines the ideas of all rules in that category, while clearly differentiating it from the other categories.\\\\nThe new rule should be as specific as possible, following the format of the given rules.\\\\nThe new rule should be applicable without any information from the original rules - i.e. it should be standalone.\\\\n\\\\nRules:\\\\n1. To make the output, you first have to search for the color used in the upper part of the input pattern. Then, starting from the top left corner of the output grid, you have to draw a diagonal line using the obtained color that ends on the first row of the lower part of the pattern. The length of the diagonal line, which is made by the obtained color, should be equal to the number of squares used in the vertical part of the input pattern on the left side.\\\\n2. To make the output, you have to consider the colored square that fills the most area in the upper area above the empty space for each of the input cases. Then, draw a diagonal line from the top right to the bottom left in the empty space below the shape, leaving black space between each colored square. The diagonal line color should match the color of the shape that fills most of the area in the upper area.\\\\n3. The output grid is a mirror image of the input grid, whereas the color pattern/shape remains in the same position, unaffected. However, some color from the pattern/shape forms a diagonal line from the top right corner of the grid, running downwards, until it connects to the shape. Where the color from the pattern is not available, it is replaced by black. The rest of the grid remains black.\\\\n4. The transformation involves taking the separate color (third color) present in some cases and mirroring it diagonally into the top black region of the grid without overwriting any existing pattern in that region. If there is no third color present in the original pattern, no transformation occurs and the grid remains the same.\\\\n5. To make the output, take the rightmost column or row of the colored blocks from the section above the last row of black blocks and append it as a diagonal from top right to bottom left within the same section. This diagonal appendage will overwrite any existing colored blocks.\\\\n6. To make the output, first, look for the colored shape inside the larger colored shape. Then take this color and create a diagonal line starting from the top right corner of the grid into the middle of the grid, stopping right at the half point. This diagonal follows the left down direction respecting the black cells until it reaches half of the grid. It should be noted that: diagonal formation should not overwrite any previously colored cells.\\\\n7. To make the output grid, you need to mirror the row with another color (brown, teal etc.) below the row of color tiles (green or blue etc.). The color tiles should be mirrored diagonally from bottom left to top right, filling the bottom half of the grid. If there is no other color distinctive from the divider and black in the top half, any non-black tiles in the bottom half should remain as they are in the input.\\\\n8. To make the output, you have to move the randomly placed color cells to the same column that have the same color in the shape above. If there are multiple same color cells, they fill the empty cells from top to bottom. If there is no the same color in the shape above, mean keep it in its original place. Also, maintain the rest of input as it is.\\\\n9. To make the output, you have to locate the non-black color that is not part of the shape in the middle and place it in reverse diagonal pattern on the top left corner of the grid above the shape. It\\\\\\'s as if a mirror is placed along a reverse diagonal from top right to bottom left of the grid, and the color is reflected on the other side of this mirror. These cells will replace existing black cells and everything else remains the same.\\\\n10. To make the output, you have to  copy the last two rows of the colored pattern (from bottom). Then, shift or move it upwards by the number of black rows at the top to replace the black boxes. The direction of movement for each digit is diagonally towards the top right.\\\\n11. To make the output, you have to mirror the graphic pattern from the line below the top pattern to the left. The copied pattern is inverted in the process. This operation excludes black (0) cells which should be left as black after the transformation.\\\\n12. To make the output, you have to take the color-filled cells from the lower part of the grid and mirror them into the upper empty parts of the grid. The mirrored cells should be inserted from right to left and the placement should be in diagonal form.\\\\n13. To make the output, you have to mirror the top shape, which is above the brown line, in the rows below the black line. The mirrored image should start from the bottom right of the image, going upwards at an angle towards the left, and only fill black squares, without overlapping with the lower shape, if it exists.\\\\n14. To make the output, you have to first identify the diagonal pattern of colored boxes. This pattern starts at the first box on the diagonal and extends to where it meets the middle of the grid vertically. Once identified, you then have to replicate this diagonal pattern in the lower half of the grid as well, but in reverse order (mirrored along the vertical middle of the grid). The diagonal starting point in this case would be the box that is in the middle of the grid horizontally. The boxes that are not part of this pattern remain black.\\\\n15. To make the output, you have to take the non-black colors other than the ones creating the image and place them in the diagonally opposite corner. The numbers are placed diagonally from top left to bottom right. For more than one number, the diagonal follows from left to right.\\\\n16. The transformation involves creating a mirror image of the colored parts (not including black) from the top half onto the bottom half. The mirror axis is the colored horizontal line. The reflection is always towards the right side on the bottom, from the most left part of the original image. Hence, even parts of the image that were in the left part on the top half will appear in the right in the bottom half after transformation. Also, if there is an extra colored part in the bottom half in the input that does not correlate to any part in the top half, that part remains unaffected in the transformation.\\\\n17. To make the output, you have to find the shape that occurs at the top of the grid. Then the same shape, colored with the same color, needs to be mirroring positioned along the diagonal from the top left to the bottom right corner. The position of the shape in the top half is woven into the position in the bottom half and vice versa. It is an exact mirror from the diagonal.\\\\n18. To transform the input grid into the output grid, the pattern involves reflective symmetry along the vertical axis (imagine a mirror half-way through the grid horizontally). In detail, the colored cells on the left side are reflected on the right side. It is like flipping the colored shapes over to the right side of the grid. The flip is done diagonally downwards from left to right. Notice that the color of the mirrored shape is different from the original, but keeps the same for every case.\\\\n19. To make the output, you have to keep the colored box on the left intact. Then, find the color box which is located at the bottom right corner within the larger box and copy it in diagonal order from the bottom right of this box to the top right of the grid. If the two color boxes are not of the same color, choose the one with the smaller value. In case there is no color box at the bottom corner of the larger box, fill the upper right corner of the grid with black cells.\\\\n20. To make the output, have a look at the color patterns in the input grid. You are to fill the remaining boxes to complete a diagonal line from right to left from the color box closest to the top right corner. Leave the rest of the pattern as it is. Take a note of the colour of the pattern to keep it consistent. Ignore black boxes, they do not carry any pattern.  For example, in Case 0, you\\\\\\'ll see the number 9 in the grid and fill the rest of the diagonal line with number 9 too. In Case 1 there is an incomplete diagonal line filled with number 6, so you complete it with number 6. You can see how this applies to the other cases as well.\\\\n21. The transformation involves moving the central region of the first shape downward, following a diagonal trajectory. This region should also flip vertically. The color of the central region becomes the color of its border, so each cell in this region should adopt the value of the upper left cell from the first shape in the input.\\\\n22. To make the output, you have to take the top left colored pixel (that is not black) of the top object in the input and duplicate it diagonally in the black object in the same position. Depending on the input, this can result in different color pixels or the process can be repeated for different colors.\\\\n23. To make the output, you have to assume that the rectangle has a mirror surface and it has formed the image of the outermost rectangle on the top of the grid. Then observe the pattern: for every color of the rectangle, the number of its images is equal to the number of colors inside it including itself. For each image, starting from the edge of the grid going towards its reflection, color the diagonal cells with the color of the image. Continue this for all colors following the rules until all cells to be colored are colored.\\\\n24. To make the output, you have to replicate the colors in the diagonal line from the lower-left corner to the upper-right corner. This diagonal line in the output grid delineates the boundary of the picture frame from blank space and should have the same color sequence observed in the input picture, excluding the black space.\\\\n25. To make the output, you have to rotate the colored object 180 degrees. The rest of the black grid remains unchanged in the output.\\\\n26. Identify the color (not black) of the top shape and add a line of dots in the same color to the black cells, starting from the top right corner and going diagonally down to the left until you reach the shape in the middle. The number of dots is the same as the height of the top shape. The placement of the dots should be that each dot is one cell lower and one cell to the left than the previous dot.\\\\n27. To make the output, scan the whole area until you find a colored square. Draw a line from this color to the upper right corner with the same color. The line should go up one step and two steps to the right each time, filling the grid with the color until it hits the boundary. The rule for drawing the line only applies when the field is initially empty (black). If there is a color or a figure in place already, skip this square.\\\\n28. To produce the output, a diagonal line of cells matching the less frequent color in the lower part of the input grid is added to the upper part. The line starts from the right top corner of the grid and continues diagonally towards the left bottom corner until it intersects with the colored pattern in the upper part. The lower part of the input grid remains unchanged in the output.\\\\n29. To make the output, you should move the coloured segment that is less than half the size of the larger one to the top left corner, following the diagonal from the top-left to the bottom-right. If there are multiple smaller segments, move them one by one until they form a diagonal from the top left. The larger segment remains in its place.\\\\n30. The transformation process is as follows: take the top color cell left of the separating line and place it diagonally from the top right corner down to the left, until the separating line is reached. If the top color cell is not alone and has one or more directly below it, continue the diagonal line with these colors in the lower half of the grid starting directly below the separating line. Note that an empty row separates the color cells in the upper half of the grid from those in the lower half.\\\\n31. To transform the input grid into the output grid, find the non-black color that occurs above or to the left of another color section and is separated from that section by a line of black cells. Make a diagonal line of that color in the black cells above and to the right of the section, from the top right corner down the middle, such that the line\\\\\\'s length is equal to the section\\\\\\'s height. If there are multiple of these situations, prioritize the one with lower row index, and among those with the same row index, the one with the lower column index.\\\\n32. To make the output, you have to take the dot color (if there is one) and draw a diagonal line starting from the top right corner going to the bottom left corner. This line of dots should be placed at the central area of the upper portion of the grid. If there is no dot color inside the rectangle, do nothing.\\\\n33. Recreate the input grid in the first step, except for replacing some black cells. To determine the black cells to fill, consider the unique colored box inside the second square: If it\\\\\\'s in the upper half of the square, mirror this structure in the bottom half of the top square. If the unique colored box is in the bottom half of the second square, mirror its pattern in the upper half of the first square.\\\\n34. To make the output, you have to first copy all the squares from the input to the output. After that, you should create a diagonal line that starts from the most left-bottom corner and goes towards the most top-right corner. The color of the diagonal line should be the color of the most left-bottom colored square in the input not considering black color which could be interpreted as a background. If there is no such color then the diagonal is black.\\\\n35. To make the output, you have to take the symbol or number in the middle of the input grid, and \"drag\" it up through the black squares in a diagonal direction from the bottom left to the top right, stopping before it reaches the boundary of the black squares. All the other elements of the grid remain unchanged.\\\\n36. To make the output, you have to take the highest column of unique color in the top figure (not black or duplicate colors in the column) and replicate it in reverse order at the top of the canvas replacing the black squares. If there are no unique colors in the top figure, leave it as black. The rest of the grid remains intact.\\\\n37. To make the output: 1) Leave all the squares in the same color if they are part the colored figure visible in the initial grid. 2) Place some colored squares on the upper part of the grid, starting from an edge and following a diagonal direction, as if they were a reflection of the color of the larger colored figure. The number of these squares and their disposition will correspond to the width of the larger colored figure. Make the squares black if they are not part of any figure mentioned in point 1) or 2).  This transformation could be also described as: a reflection of the larger figure by the horizontal axis passing through the center of the grid, changing the color of the cells from the color of the larger figure in the input to the color of the smaller figure in the input.\\\\n38. To make the output, you have to identify the smallest rectangle formed by the color that contains another color (not black or the color itself). Once identified, concentrate the contained color into the diagonal squares of the rectangle, starting from the top right corner to the bottom right corner, and then from the top left corner to the bottom left. If there\\\\\\'s more than one color in the inner part of the rectangle, deal with one color at a time, preferably with the color that fills more square units. Make sure to maintain the color of the rest of the grid while you are concentrating the specified color.\\\\n39. To make the output, the colored cells which are on the right side of the colored area, is shifted diagonally to the left side empty cells above the colored area. The shift starts from bottom to top in a sequential manner. Remaining part of the grid stays the same.\\\\n40. To make the output, you have to draw a diagonal line from the upper right corner to the lower left corner of the entire grid and reflect the pattern or object across that diagonal line. For the diagonal line, consider the color of the unique cells that are not part of the main pattern or object, and not black. The reflection (or the mirrored image) of the pattern or object is in the same color as it was originally.\\\\n41. To make the output, you identify the number of colors on the left half of the input grid. You then mirror these colors on the right half of the grid, directly diagonally from the original position. The original positions on the left half remain the same, while the additional colors to the right of the midpoint are placed diagonally down from the right-hand limit, forming a diagonal line.\\\\n42. To create the output, look for the color above the colored line in the middle (if there is one). Find the color that is shared between all rectangles if there are multiple. Then, starting from the bottom left, draw a diagonal line using that color until you hit the colored line or the edge of the grid if there is no such line.\\\\n43. To make the output, create a diagonal border that starts from the top right corner and extends down left, and replace its color with the color of shapes found in the space below the original colored shape. If no colored shapes present, keep the existing colors.\\\\n44. To make the output, observe the smallest square or rectangle of colored cells inside the colored cells area in the input. If there is no such smaller square or rectangle, keep the grid the same. If there is, take the colored cells from that smaller square or rectangle and place them in a diagonal line starting from the top right corner and moving down to the left. The first cell you place should be at the most upper right position, the second cell should be one step down and to the left, the third should be another step down and to the left from the second cell, and so on. The cells should not be modifying the colored cells area.\\\\n45. To make the output, you have to look at the row of differently colored squares at the bottom of each colored rectangle. If such a row exists, place a single square of the rectangle\\\\\\'s color on a black background at the row\\\\\\'s position inside the corresponding black area above the rectangle, making the squares ascend from right to left in a diagonal angle.\\\\n46. To transform the input grid into the output grid, we perform the following operations: 1. Retain the existing colored patterns from the input grid exactly as they are in the output grid. 2. Create a diagonal pattern with the color present on top of the box shape (this box is at the center-bottom part of the grid) from the upper left corner towards the center of the grid.  Conclusion: The overall transformation involves adding a new diagonal with the color on top of the box shape towards the center while keeping all other components from the input grid intact.\\\\n47. To make the output, you should find the color that makes up the \"semi-circle\" or \"symmetrical\" object, then draw an extra line of the same color that consisting of decreasingly many squares from top to bottom on the right side of the grid. The starting point of the first square is located on the center right area of the grid, subsequent squares are located underneath and to the left of the previous square. The shape and color of the bottom object remain the same.\\\\n48. To make the output, simply take the yellow square (if any) and move it diagonally at a slope of 1, from lower left to upper right, to the leftmost available location on the same diagonal line it is currently placed. If there are more than one yellow squares, repeat the process with each one.\\\\n49. The transformation consists of replicating the small lines colored differently that appear within the initial colored rectangle into the blank space above the rectangle in the output grid. The replicated lines should be positioned diagonally from the top right corner towards the left. The rest of the grid remains the same.\\\\n50. To make the output, you have to find the color of the object that is at the central row (or column if the diagonals are empty) and draw diagonals of that color from the top left towards the bottom right in the upper left part of the grid. If there is no object, leave the cells as they are.\\\\n51. To make the output, you have to take the upper left colored rectangle and rotate it 90 degrees counter-clockwise, then position that rectangle in the upper right corner of the output grid. The size of the rectangle remains the same and the relative positions of the colors inside the rectangle also remains the same after rotation. The rest of the matrix remains unchanged.\\\\n52. The transformation process involves taking the color of the pixels from the top-right corner of the block of color in the figure, and repositioning it into the black area below. The placement reflects a diagonal pattern - starting from the top-right corner and extending diagonally down to the left. Reposition the color using this diagonal pattern until a mirrored arrangement of the color is obtained or until the black spaces are filled up. If the color gets exhausted, fill the rest of the black spaces following the same pattern with black pixels.\\\\n53. To make the output, you have to make a mirror reflection of the colors from the bottom block onto the top block. Any colors in the bottom block should be reflected at a diagonal angle onto the top block, replacing the black cells. You should only reflect the colors once.\\\\n54. To make the output, the pattern emerges from the top right dot of the grid. For each row from top to bottom, shift this color one cell left from the position of the color in the top right dot in the input. A diagonal line of the color dot will appear starting from the top right position of the input towards the bottom left position of the output. The rest of the grid remains the same in the output as in the input.\\\\n55. The transformation from the input to output entails rotating the top symbol 90 degrees clockwise and placing it at the top left corner of the grid, while the rest of the grid remains the same. If observed side by side, the rotated symbol in the output would perfectly overlay the original symbol in the input if the input were also rotated 90 degrees clockwise.\\\\n56. To create the output, you have to mark the place of the highest of the (green, blue, brown) rectangles with the color of the lower rectangle, forming a downward diagonal from the upper right corner to the lower left corner. The diagonals don\\\\\\'t touch the bottom rectangle. The rest of the grid is the same as input. The diagonal is placed on the black space, and it does not overlap with any color other than black.\\\\n57. To make the output, you leave everything as is, but you need to add the same color as the top shape in a diagonal line at the empty area above the grey shape. To be more specific, the color starts from the right corner of the empty area and goes down diagonally to the left.\\\\n58. To make the output grid, first examine any color strip at the top. If it is interrupted by another color somewhere, take that color and fill the highest black squares of each column at the bottom of the grid. Count the number of cells with the intrusion color on the top colored strip; place that many cells of the color corresponding to the top color strip, starting from the top right cell of the black grid at the bottom and moving diagonally downward to the left..\\\\n59. To produce the output grid, you have to identify the row containing the smallest number of black cells (ignoring any fully black rows). Then, on the upper half of the grid (above this identified row), replicate the sequence of the smallest number of non-black cells (ignoring completely black columns) from this row inversely from the rightmost column inward. Essentially, create a rightward pointing triangle on the upper half above the identified row with a peak touching the rightmost column of the grid, its color and size reflecting the identified sequence from the row. The transformation should preserve the lower half of the grid as it is.\\\\n60. To make the output, you have to maintain the top half as the same as the input. For the bottom half, you create a new colored line (fourth color) that starts from the side where the third color is not adjacent to the rectangle, and extend diagonally, towards the same sided corner where the rectangle was present. The deep color squares should move from the edge towards the center in a diagonal manner with each square, stopping before overlapping with any other non-black color.\\\\n61. To make the output, move the color from the end of each column in the top section (just above the all-black row) down to the end of each corresponding column in the bottom section, maintaining the distance from the bottom. Fill the remaining cells in the bottom section with zeros. The top section remains unchanged.\\\\n62. To transform the input to the output, find the color/number in the object at the upper part of the grid that matches the color/number in the object in the lower part of the grid. Retrieve the coordinates of the matching color/number in the lower object and create a diagonal line, from top to bottom, in the corresponding line from the upper right corner, so that it leads to the lower right corner, using the matched color/number.\\\\n63. To transform the input into the output, you would need to draw a diagonal line from top right to the bottom left. The color of this line will be the same as the color of the shape or lines on the top or middle of the input grid. The rest of the grid will remain unchanged.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "After analyzing the rules, they can be categorized into eight distinct categories based on their similarities:\n\nCategory 1: Rules involving diagonal lines\n1.

For each category, synthesize the rules into a single, specific rule that combines the ideas of all rules in that category, while clearly differentiating it from the other categories.\\\\nThe new rule should be as specific as possible, following the format of the given rules.\\\\nThe new rule should be applicable without any information from the original rules - i.e. it should be standalone.\\\\n\\\\nRules:\\\\n1. To make the output, you have to spread the teal square to the right of its initial location, pushing it to fill black squares until it reaches another teal square or reaches the edge of the grid. The color spread to each column and each column keeps the color it first received. Portions of the grid that had red squares keep their color and shape unchanged.\\\\n2. To make the output, you have to slide each teal dot to the right until it hits a red dot or the edge of the grid. If there\\\\\\'s no red dot in its row, the teal dot moves to the far right of the grid.\\\\n3. To make the output, you have to follow these rules:  1. Move the teal color block down and repeat it until it meets the red block. 2. The red block remains in place. 3. The block tiles should move around the grid as if it were a conveyor belt, with other blocks moving to make space for it. 4. Blacks should fill up spaces left by the movement of other blocks.  As a result, the blocks will move around, circulating in their row, until the red block stops their movement.\\\\n4. The process involves a multistep process. First, find the lines of teal pixels from left to right in every row of the input grid. Then, shift the lines of teal pixels to the right on each alternate row, forming zigzag patterns of teal lines across the grid. Red blocks, if any, are not shifted.\\\\n5. To make the output, you have to create an alternating pattern, where the teal color moves left from top to bottom, then right from the bottom to top, until it reaches its original position. The red colors remain fixed in their position.\\\\n6. To make the output, you have to slide the individual teal cells horizontally across the grid to the right until they hit a vertical obstacle or the right boundary of the grid. When approaching a red cell, the teal cells should stop right before hitting it.\\\\n7. To make the output, you have to rotate and translate the teal squares into four segments in a square spiral pattern starting at the corners of the grid. The rotation starts from upper left, lower left, lower right then upper right. The red squares remain at their place and not moved or rotated.\\\\n8. To make the output, you have to move the teal squares by shifting them to the right while maintaining the same interval at which they appear in input. However, the shifting pattern is like a cycle, meaning that the teal pixels in the final column are moved to the first column. The red squares remain at their original positions and are not affected by the shifting.\\\\n9. The transformation involves shifting the position of the teal squares. The squares at the top-most and bottom-most positions remain where they are. The rest of the teal squares move towards the right, but their vertical position doesn\\\\\\'t change. The pattern of movement is a repeating cycle of three steps (four, if we include the stationary condition). The steps are as follows :  1. The teal square remains stationary. 2. The square moves two steps to the right. 3. The square moves two more steps to the right. After this, the cycle repeats. The red squares remain where they are without changing their position.\\\\n10. You have to shift the teal cells to the center of the grid. Each line containing a teal cell should be divided into four sections of equal size. If the initial teal cell is in the first quarter, shift it to cover all of the fourth quarter. If it is in the second, third, or fourth quarter, shift it to cover the first, second, or third quarter correspondingly. The lines that do not contain any teal cells shift to red if they have any.\\\\n11. To transform the input into the output, draw successive teal \"U\" shapes, starting on the left, with the base of the \"U\" always occurring on the row where the original teal line turned. The height of the U shape should stop at the row above the next turn or the end of the grid. Any isolated red points remain in the same position.\\\\n12. To make the output, you have to follow these steps:  1. Clone the input grid.  2. Find the positions where there is a teal cell in the first row. 3. Make all the cells in these positions teal in every 4 row below. Repeat the same making process in every 4 row for the rest of rows. 4. Keep the last row as it is as in the input grid.\\\\n13. To make the output, you have to rearrange the column groups which contains teal pixels, the lower the teal pixels are, the more left it should be arranged on the output grid. The red pixels are remained in their places.\\\\n14. To make the output, you have to follow two steps. 1- For each teal block in the input, replace that block with a corresponding 4x4 square made up of teal blocks in the output. The 4x4 square is positioned so that the original teal block is the top left corner of the square. 2- Maintain the red blocks at the same position from the input to the output.\\\\n15. To start transforming, identify columns with teal at the top of them in the original grid. These will be the starting point of a series of stripes that move towards the left side, filling the entire grid. If a column with teal is found, this triggers an alternating pattern of filling in four cells with teal then four cells with black, moving row by row from top to bottom. This pattern continues until the second to last row for all stripes.   The last row is kept as in the input. This means any existing teal or red colors in the bottom stripe are overwritten with black except for the last row. This pattern resets whenever you reach a column with teal at the top or when you\\\\\\'ve filled a section of four columns with either black or teal.   Finally, the rows with red are kept as is from the input to the output, that is they are not affected by the teal and black stripes.  Note: The transformation doesn\\\\\\'t seem to be symmetric; transposing the grid doesn\\\\\\'t yield the same transformation. Also, rotation doesn\\\\\\'t seem to play a role in the transformation.\\\\n16. To create the output from the input, the teal squares are shifted downwards gradually to fill the rows below their initial position while maintaining column alignment. The squares move down to fill the black (empty) rows, using the red squares as a stopping point. This shift continues down the grid until the red squares block further movement, effectively forming a vertical barrier. The teal squares accumulate and stop at the rows where the red squares are located. Note that the red squares have not moved or changed in any way during the transformation.\\\\n17. To make the output, you have to shift the teal cells to the right in each row such that they form diagonal lines progressively moving rightwards. The position of the red cells remains unchanged.\\\\n18. To make the output, you have to take the teal color in the first row, then copy and shift that pattern row by row in a clockwise spiral manner, until the center of the grid. The pattern should be controlled by the presence of red color, if the red cells replace the teal, it should stop copying. The red and black cells should stay the same in all other places.\\\\n19. To make the output, recognize the teal squares in the vertical line, and create a matching column to the right of existing teal squares. Do this until you move all the teal squares to the left side. After this transformation, red squares should not move. Their position remains the same as in the input.\\\\n20. To make the output, you have to repeat the pattern seen in the input. The pattern is repeating the teal elements for the entirety of the row, the number of times depends on the positions of the teal elements in the row. Specifically, if the teal element is in the nth column in the input, then the teal elements should repeat in the next n rows in the output. The position of the red elements remains unchanged.\\\\n21. To make the output, you need to fill the grid with 8s on the right side of every 8 in the input. This fill should stop when encountering a 2 or the boundary of the grid. The direction of the fill changes after every 3 rows starting from the top: first to the right, then to the left, then upwards and then it repeats. The 2s in the grid remain in the same position.\\\\n22. To make the output, you need to shift the teal cells to the right, wrapping them around when they reach the edge of the grid. For every consecutive line of teal cells, apply a shift one step more to the right applied compared to the previus line. Stop shifting when you reach a red cell.\\\\n23. To transform the input into the output, imagine rotating the existing line of teal cells by 90 degrees anti-clockwise about the center of the grid, with the implied center point falling somewhere to the left of the line of teal cells. After rotation, the line of teal cells forms a series of radiating lines from the center at regular intervals. The red cells remain in the same position.\\\\n24. To make the output, you have to create a mirror image of the teal pixels at the top by taking the furthest pixel on the right to correspond to the furthest left pixel on the bottom, and continue this pattern for all pixels. Do the same for the red pixels but from the bottom upwards.\\\\n25. To make the output, you have to rotate the teal \\\\\\'arrow\\\\\\' with each step having the teal \\\\\\'arrow\\\\\\' rotate anti clockwise from its original position by 90 degrees each time. The red cells stay in the same place during the transformation.\\\\n26. After the presence of the first red square, the teal squares start moving to the left by 1 position with each line. In the 4th line after a red square, the teal squares are replaced by black squares and start from the rightmost side again in the next line. This repeats until another red square is found and then the pattern repeats over.\\\\n27. To make the output, shift the occurrences of teal from the first row to a diagonal from the upper right corner to the lower left corner, in increments of rows relative to the diagonal. The locations of focused teal color should resemble a z or n pattern over the grid. Leave the red-colored cells unchanged.\\\\n28. The transformation involves rotating the pillars at a quarter of their heights. In the output grid, we see that the teal pillars have rotated, thereby moving the red objects or lights. The field (black) remains unchanged. The transformation does not apply to the pillars that do not have any red lights. The lights on a pillar move along with the rotation of the pillar.   Note: Consider the grid as a wrapping cylinder, which means objects exiting one side reenter through the opposite side. In other words, what goes off-screen comes back on-screen from the other side.\\\\n29. The transformation rule involves translating the topmost teal pixel line down the grid rows so that the teal pixels are always below any red pixel present in the grid. If there\\\\\\'s no red pixel in the column, copy the teal pixel down the entire row as per the columns\\\\\\' teal pattern in the topmost row of the input. The red pixels retain their positions unaltered while the rest of the grid remains black.\\\\n30. To make the output, you have to shift the teal cells to the right side for each row, starting from the top row shifting the first teal cell to the right once, increasing additional shifts by 1 for each subsequent row. For the red cells, they remain in the same position.\\\\n31. To make the output, you have to take the first teal cell and every teal cell following it, and bring them down until they are above the first red cell. If there is a second sequence of teal cells do the same, but bring them down above the second red cell. This should form a vertical sequence of teal cells above the red cells. This pattern should continue until all teal cells have been moved above red cells. All other cells should remain black.\\\\n32. To transform the input grid to output: 1. In the case where there are singular teal pixels in a horizontal line, replace each pixel from its position down to the next same position with teal pixels (not including the next one). 2. For the red pixels, leave them as they are. They are not affected by the spread of the teal pixels. 3. All other pixels remain black.   This forms a kind of \"waterfall\" effect with teal pixels where the fall starts from the original teal pixels and the red pixels acting as constant \"obstacles\".\\\\n33. To make the output, you have to take the original configuration of teal squares in the input. Now, progressively shift their positions to the right, moving over the space of four columns each time, until a teal column reaches the last column of the grid. The rest of the grid should remain the same, including the red squares in the bottom row. This shift should wrap around from the right side to the left side; one teal square moving off the right end of the grid should appear on the left side.\\\\n34. Count the number of black cells in each row in the input grid until you encounter a red or teal cell. Then, shift all non-black cells (red and teal) to the right by the count you made earlier to form the output grid. That means you\\\\\\'re moving the cells to the right for the number of black cells you counted until you got a colored cell. It will look as if the cells are falling to the right.\\\\n35. To make the output: 1. Identify the horizontal rows where the purple digits (8) appear. 2. In these rows, shift the purple digits to the right step by step in the consecutive rows. 3. Keep moving the purple digits until they reach the other side of the grid. 4. After the purple digits have reached the right side, start shifting them to the left until they reach their original position. 5. Continue this process for all the rows where purple digits appear.  6. Retain any other colored digits (red) in their original position. 7. All black cells remain black.\\\\n36. To make the output, you have to first locate the teal boxes in the input grid. If a teal box is present, a corresponding teal square is created to its right, with dimensions equal to its row number (based on zero index). For example, for the teal box in the third row, a teal square of 3x3 is created to the right of the original teal box and the square is filled with teal. The red boxes are transferred to the output grid as it is.\\\\n37. To make the output, you have to Replace the row with teal on top for rows having a red box at the end. The rows which doesn\\\\\\'t contain a red box remains black. The red boxes in the input grid remain in the same places in the output grid.\\\\n38. To make the output, you have to rotate the top row containing teal cells counterclockwise. The orientation of this rotation should be the same as switching dimensions in a matrix from (row, col) to (col, row). The red cells remain unchanged and all remaining black cells also remain unchanged.\\\\n39. To make the output, extend the teal rows horizontally and distribute them evenly throughout the grid, maintaining the separation that they have from one another in the input. The position of the red squares is not affected - they should stay in the same place. The teal squares should not overlap the red ones. If there\\\\\\'s a red square in their way, they should stop and continue from the other side.\\\\n40. To make the output, you have to create diagonal rows of teal cells from the bottom-left to top-right based on the original vertical line of teal cells in the input. The red cells retain their original positions.\\\\n41. Each green dot creates concentric square waves moving down the grid. Each red dot causes a temporary inversion of these square waves for the row containing the red dot only. So, for each green dot, we have propagating waves of \"greens\" (following the pattern of alternating green and black) from top to bottom, with the wave being inverted at the row of each red dot.\\\\n42. To make the output, first locate the entire set of blank spaces (black squares) that are surrounded by colored squares, either teal or red. Then begin filling these blank spaces with teal squares according to the following pattern: For the blank spaces to the right of the teal squares and below the red squares, fill them with teal squares equivalent to the number of squares between them and the colored squares above them. Repeat this for every vertically aligned red square and sequence of teal squares on the top.\\\\n43. To make the output, you have to  fill in the empty spaces of every row that contains a teal pixel, with the teal pixels moving to the right of the row as we go down the grid. Rows containing a red pixel remain unchanged.\\\\n44. The transformation pattern involves shifting the positioned teal color (number 8) systemic dots to the bottom for each group separately after alignment in bottom. Each dot creates a vertical line upwards until it reaches the top. When there are no more dots to shift downwards in its line, that line remains filled with black (number 0). The red dots remain in exactly the same position they were in the input.\\\\n45. The transformation seems to involve only the teal cells. It appears that where there exist teal cells on the input, there are three new consecutive teal squares formed beside it in the output to the right of it, while preserving the original teal squares, all nine forming a teal 3x3 square. The black cells filled with teal in the output are those that are on the same rows as the original teal cells but to their right in the step. The original red cells are left unchanged.\\\\n46. To achieve the output, you need to shift the teal line downwards by a number of steps proportional to its position from the top of the grid. After 4 steps downward, the teal line begins to shift upwards by 4 steps. Red squares stay where they are through this transformation.\\\\n47. To make the output you have to divide the grid into three equal vertical regions. Swap the content of the first and the third region(horizontal stripes) on condition that the stripes have atleast one non black element (teal or red). Note that the content(s) of second region remains the same.\\\\n48. To make the output, hold the position of red (2) boxes intact, while the teal (8) boxes rotate 90 degree clockwise within their own 4x4 grids, excluding the bottom row.\\\\n49. To make the output, you have to project the teal cell down in its column until it hits an obstacle (either a red block or the end of the grid). The path of the drop should then be colored teal. Repeat this for every teal cell in the input grid. The red cell remains in its place.\\\\n50. To make the output, you have to take the positions of the orange cell at every 4th input row, starting from the first row that contains an orange cell, and place an orange cell in those positions in every row between every 4 rows that contains a red cell. The position of orange cells can change column-wise, but it stays in the same row. For the other positions that an orange cell didn\\\\\\'t occupy, copy the cells from the input.\\\\n51. The output grid is created by shifting each teal square on the input grid to the right by one position after each row. When the teal square reaches the end of a row, it starts again from the beginning of the next row. The red squares on the bottom row of the grid remain unchanged.\\\\n52. To make the output, you have to apply the following rules: - The red and teal numbers are static and their positions don\\\\\\'t change.  - The teal numbers originally first filled from the first column to first teal number, they have to be moved to the corresponding rows filling from the last column back. The empty spaces left on the first side is filled with black. - This transformation is continued for the whole grid such that the teal numbers are shifted from the starting columns to the ending ones on their rows.\\\\n53. In order to transform the input grids into their corresponding outputs, a cyclic shift to the right by 4 blocks needs to occur for each successive row.\\\\n54. To achieve the output, a varying number of teal points is created for every one on the input line, forming a continuous vertical line of teal points that are mirrored from the center of the grid. The mirrored points don\\\\\\'t replace the red points - they stay where they are.\\\\n55. To transform the input grid to the output grid, partition the grid excluding the row with red (2) cells, into 3 equal parts vertically. Move the teal (8) cells in each part to the opposite part of the grid; the teal cells in the top third should be transferred to the bottom third, those in the middle third should move to the top third and the ones in the lower third should go to the middle third. The position of red (2) cells remains the same.\\\\n56. To make the output, you have to take the first colored cell (teal) in each row and replicate it in the next three empty cells to the right. If any colored cell (red) exists at these positions, they should not be overwritten. Move to the next row until all rows are processed.\\\\n57. To make the output, you have to apply a rotation by 90 degrees clockwise on the teal color leaving red and black untouched. This results in an output with horizontal lines of teal instead of vertical, with red rows remaining the same.\\\\n58. To form the output grid, the transformation involves taking each teal digit from the top row and shifting it downwards and to the right in a diagonal line. After shifting, the line formed has a slope of 1 and extends to the right edge of the grid. Repeat this process for each red digit from the bottom row but shift them upwards and to the right. If a teal and red number intersect, the teal number takes precedence and remains in the output grid.\\\\n59. To make the output, you have to simulate the motion of a wave, starting from the teal pixel at the left end. Whenever you encounter a teal pixel at the point of wave propagation, it propagates the wave in the forward direction. The propagation should stop when red pixels are encountered on their path.\\\\n60. To make the output, you have to replicate the teal dot in the following three spots of its sequence along the width of the matrix, except if a red dot exists in the sequence. In that case, consider the red dot as the starting point of the next sequence and replicate the teal dot in the next three spots. Continue this till the end of the width of the matrix and repeat for every sequence along the height of the matrix. Keep the position of red dots unchanged.\\\\n61. To make the output, you would start from the bottom up. The red cells stay the same in the output. For the teal cells, start with the highest row with the teal cell (closest to red line) and transform the cells to the right of it into teal cells until it reaches the end of the row. Then shift one space to the left in each subsequent row (ignoring rows without a teal cell on the left) until you have no more teal cell.\\\\n62. To make the output, shift the teal cells diagonally towards the lower right. With each step, rotate the teal cells 90 degrees to the right. The red line remains unchanged.\\\\n63. To make the output, you have to look at each row in isolation.  If a row contains a teal cell, you should move the teal cells towards the center of the row. The central teal cell (or cells if the number of teal cells is even) remains in its place. All other teal cells move towards the center, maintaining the same order from left and right. Black cells fill the rest of the row. If the row only contains black cells or red cells, it remains unchanged.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "Category 1: Rules involving shifting teal cells to the right until they hit a boundary or a red cell.\n- Rules: 2, 6, 22, 30, 34, 51, 53\n- Synthesized Rule: To make the output, shift each teal cell to the right until it hits a red cell or the edge of the grid.

To make the output, you have to look at blocks of orange cells in columns 1 to 3 and columns 4 to 7. If a block of orange cells in columns 1 to 3 has more cells than its corresponding block in columns 4 to 7 (on the same row), mark the corresponding cell in the output as 0 (black). If a block of orange cells in columns 1 to 3 has less cells than its corresponding block in columns 4 to 7 (on the same row), mark the corresponding cell in the output as 3 (green). If both blocks of orange cells have equal number of cells, mark the corresponding cell in the output as 0 (black). The location of the cell in the output corresponds to the location of the middle (blue) cell in columns 1 to 3.\\\\n2. To make the output, you have to combine the colors in the merged columns. For the first and third columns,  when there are certain color in both the merged cells for the respective column in the same row, assign blue in output grid. If only one cell has a color, assign green. If no cells have a color, leave as black. For the middle column (originally single), if it has color, assign green, otherwise leave as black.\\\\n3. To make the output, convert the input grid in the following way:  - The grid is divided into left and right halves, each of size 4x3, according to the 4th column. - Now, for each row compare the left-half and right-half. If the number of red(1) cells in the left-half is less than the number of gray(5) cells in the right-half, then fill the corresponding row in the output grid with green(3). Otherwise, fill it with black cells(0).\\\\n4. To make the output, you have to compare the boxes on the left and right side of the yellow line in the input grid, box by box corresponding to their places. If they are both red or both black, make the output box black. If one is red and one is black, make the output box green. Ignore the yellow boxes while making the output grid.\\\\n5. To make the output, you need to count the number of orange and grey blocks in each row. For each row, if the number of grey blocks exceeds the number of orange blocks, make the middle column of the corresponding row in the output green. Else, make the middle column of the corresponding row in the output black. The rest of the cells of the output grid should be black.\\\\n6. To make the output, you must compare each corresponding cell of the left and right side:  If both sides are the same value, change it to black. If one side is orange and the other side is not, change it to green. If neither side is orange, have it remain black.  Then, remove the middle vertical line and the last 2 columns on both sides, retaining only the first three columns from the right side after the middle vertical line.\\\\n7. Transform the grid by looking at the right half (to the right of the line) and treat every non-black block as one count. Make a similar count for the left half. After comparing both halves, if the count on the right side for that row has more non-black blocks, color it as blue. If it\\\\\\'s the same or less, it remains black. Apply this rule to all rows.\\\\n8. To make the output, you have to compare each row in the left section (before the blue column) and the right section (after the blue column). If both strips in the row have more coloured (non-black) cells than black cells, color the corresponding row in the output grid with a green cell in the middle column. If only one of the two strips in the row has more colored (non-black) cells than black cells, color the corresponding output row with a green cell in the column corresponding to that section - left for the left strip and right for the right strip. If neither of the strips in the row have more coloured cells than black cells, color the corresponding row in the output as entirely black.\\\\n9. To make the output, transform each column as follows: for each individual cell, if both the left and right columns in the input are colored (not black), the corresponding cell in the output becomes black. If only one of the columns in the input is colored, the corresponding cell in the output becomes green. If neither column in the input is colored, the corresponding cell in the output remains black.\\\\n10. To make the output, only consider the first four columns of the input. For each row, if the orange numbers go from left to right, color the respective cell of the output grid black. If the orange numbers go from right to left, color the respective cell of the output grid green. If there is only one orange number or none, color the respective cell of the output grid black.\\\\n11. To generate an output, compare the grid elements of two sections (Column 1-3 and 5-7, excluding the middle column). If the same colored squares (orange or gray) in two sections are in the same position, set the corresponding output square as black. If the same colored squares (orange or gray) in two sections are not in the same position, set the corresponding output square as green. For the squares with no matching colors in both sections, set the corresponding output square as black.\\\\n12. To get the output from the input, you have to compare each pair of squares to the left and right of the teal line (the 4th column). You leave out the teal line in the output. For each pair, if the left square is black or the same as the right square, place a black square in the corresponding position in the output. If the left square is not black and different from the right square, place a green square in the corresponding position in the output.\\\\n13. To make the output, you have to ignore the vertical blue column in the middle and the first square of each row. Then, compare the three squares from the left half and the three squares from the right half of each row separately: if both color squares (green and orange) are present in a row regardless of their ordering, fill the middle square of the corresponding row in the output grid with green. If not, leave it black just like the other squares.\\\\n14. To make the output, you make three comparisons. For the first column of the output, choose green if in the first column of input there are more orange than in the second one, and black otherwise. For the second column of output take green if in fifth column of the input there are more grey than in the sixth one, and black otherwise. For the third column of output select green if in the first column of the input there are more orange than in the seventh one, and black otherwise.\\\\n15. To make the output, you have to look at each row individually. If the left side (before the blue column) has more orange cells and the right side (after the blue column) has more grey cells, color the central cell of that row green in the output. If not, leave it black. The two side cells in each row of the output remain black.\\\\n16. To make the output, you have to compare each cell of the first half of the input with its corresponding cell in the second half (considering the output grid perspective): - If both cells are filled with colors (not black), then the corresponding cell in the output grid will be empty (black). - If both cells are empty (black), then the corresponding cell in the output grid will be filled with green (3). - If one cell is filled with color and the other is empty, then the corresponding cell in the output grid keeps the color of the filled cell.\\\\n17. To make the output, you have to compare each pair of cells (left and right sides) adjacent to the blue unit vertically. If both are orange or both are grey, color it as black in the output. If one is orange and the other one is grey, fill the corresponding cell in the output as green.\\\\n18. To make the output, you have to compare corresponding cells of the two 3x3 squares (excluding the blue divider). If both cells are black, output a green cell; if both cells are not black, also output a green cell. If one cell is black and the other is not, then output a black cell in that position. This transformation leaves a 3x4 matrix as the output.\\\\n19. To make the output, you have to compare the top half and the bottom half of the right side of the original grid (ignoring the central blue line), then map this to a 4x3 grid. If both the top and bottom halves of a given column have gray squares,make the corresponding output cell black. If only the top or bottom half has a gray square, make the corresponding output grid cell green. If both the top and bottom halves of a given column have black squares, make the corresponding output grid cell also black.\\\\n20. The colors of the elements to the left and right of the vertical blue line in the input grid determine the output. The comparison follows the following rules: - If the number of red elements on both sides are equal, the corresponding row element of the output grid is black. - If the number of red elements on the left is greater than on the right, the corresponding row element of the output grid is green. - If the number of red elements on the right is greater than on the left, the corresponding row element of the output grid is green.\\\\n21. To form the output grid, you will compare each orange and grey position in the columns to the right of the blue column in the input grid. For every pair of corresponding orange and grey cells (by position, not by color): - If both cells are filled, color the cell green in the same row in the output grid. - If one cell is filled and the other is not, leave the cell in the output grid black.   The exact column position in the output grid is determined by the position in the input grid. The color of a cell in the first column of the output grid corresponds to the fifth column of the input grid, the color of a cell in the second column of the output grid corresponds to the sixth column of the input grid, and the color of a cell in the final column of the output grid corresponds to the last column of the input grid.\\\\n22. To make the output, you have to locate the blue cell (which is always on the fourth column in the input) as the reference point. Look at its immediate neighbouring cells to its left and right. If both are grey (represented by the number 5), color the corresponding cell in the output grid as green (represented by the number 3). If not, leave the cell black (represented by the number 0). Do this for all rows.\\\\n23. To make the output, you have to create a 3x4 matrix from the 5th, 6th and 7th columns from the input matrix. If in any cell, the two numbers (from the input grid and the one directly below it) are different, the output cell will be \\\\\\'3\\\\\\'. If in any cell, the two numbers (from the input grid and the one directly below it) are the same, the output cell will be \\\\\\'0\\\\\\'.\\\\n24. For each row, starting from the leftmost column, you should look at every other number after the blue line (i.e., first, third and fifth number after the blue line). If all three color numbers (orange or grey or neither) match with the color in the equivalent space on the left side of the blue line, fill this space with black in the output grid. If not all three match, fill this space with green in the output grid.\\\\n25. The transformation rules involve comparing the cells in the two orange 3x3 squares and blue 1x4 line. Firstly, ignore the blue line. For the orange squares in the same position, if they are both orange or both black, the corresponding position in the output becomes a black cell; if they are different, the corresponding position in the output becomes a green cell.\\\\n26. The transformation process is like this: for each row, count the number of 7s on the left side and the number of 5s on the right side. Then if:  - If the number of 7s is greater than the number of 5s, fill the right-most cell in the output with 3 (green) and the rest with 0 (black). - If the number of 5s is greater than the number of 7s, fill the left-most cell in the output with 3 (green) and the rest with 0 (black). - If the numbers of 7s and 5s are equal, fill the middle cell in the output with 3 (green) and the rest with 0 (black).\\\\n27. The transformation pattern comprises the following main steps: 1. Start with the input grid. 2. Compare each column on the left side of the blue square with the corresponding column on the right side. 3. In the output grid, represent each column as a single square, where:    - If the number of black squares is equal on both sides of the blue square in the corresponding column, fill the corresponding square in the output with black.    - If the number of black squares is not equal on both sides (i.e., there are more black squares on one side), fill the corresponding square in the output with green.\\\\n28. To make the output, construct a 4x3 grid where each cell corresponds to the respective cell in the 4x3 section of the input grid on either side of the blue line. If the respective cells on both sides of the line are grey, the output cell should be black. If they are different colors, the output cell should be green.\\\\n29. The transformation is a comparison between identical positions in the Orange and the Gray squares in each row. If the colors are the same (either both black or both a colored cell), the corresponding cell in the output grid is Black, if not, it is Green. The Blue cell in each input row has no impact on output grid.\\\\n30. To make the output, you have to divide the input into two equal parts by the \"1\" column. Ignore the \"1\" column and check if the corresponding squares in the two halves match. If corresponding boxes from the two halves match, put \"0\" in the output. If they don\\\\\\'t match, and the boxes aren\\\\\\'t 0, put \"3\" in the output.\\\\n31. To produce the output grid, you compare each cell in the first area of the input grid (orange and black columns) with the corresponding cell (same row and column) in the second area of the input grid. If they are both non-black or they are both black, output a black cell at the corresponding position of the output grid. If one is black and one is not, output a green (3) cell at the corresponding position of the output grid. You only perform this operation for the first three columns, thus reducing the size of the grid resulting in 4x3 matrix.\\\\n32. To make the output, you have to compare the orange and gray regions in each row on both sides of the blue line. If they match (both have orange color, both have grey, or neither), make the output square black. If they do not match, make the output square green. The blue line in the input does not contribute to the output.\\\\n33. Divide the input grid in the middle vertically. The first and the second part both consist of three 2-cell wide columns divided by a blue column. The columns on each side correspond to each other from the right side of the first half to the left side of the second half (i.e., the first column on the left corresponds to the third column on the right, the second corresponds to the second, and the third corresponds to the first).  Then, transform the cell at the intersection of the i-th row and j-th column of the output grid as follows: 1. If the cells in the corresponding columns of the input grid on the first and the second parts are all black or all grey, make the cell green. 2. Otherwise, leave the cell black. The procedure above reproduces the output grid from the input grid.\\\\n34. To make the output, you have to compare every 2x2 square on either side of the blue line. If the pattern on the left (orange and black) matches the pattern on the right (grey and black) exactly when rotated 180 degrees, their corresponding space in the output grid gets filled with the colour green and black in case it does not match.\\\\n35. To create the output, you need to compare the cells in the top left 3x3 square (ignoring the blue divider) with those in the top right 3x3 square (also ignoring the blue divider). If a cell\\\\\\'s position is filled with an orange cell in both squares, fill the corresponding cell in the output with a black cell. If a cell\\\\\\'s position is not filled with an orange cell in one or both squares, fill the corresponding cell in the output with a green cell. The overall pattern seems to be an action of comparison and substitution based on these criteria.\\\\n36. To make the output, you have to compare the orange and grey cells on the same row. If the number of orange and grey cells are the same, fill all cells in that row with black in the output. If the number of grey cells is greater than the number of orange cells, fill the middle cell with green in the output. If the number of orange cells is greater than the number of grey cells, fill the middle cell with black and other cells with green on the corresponding row in the output.\\\\n37. To make the output, a pair of cells must be compared - one from the left side of the column of blue squares and one from the right. Take a 3x3 window from top to bottom. In each position of the 3x3 window on left and right, if the number is the same on left and right then fill the current 3x3 with black on its corresponding position, else fill it with green.\\\\n38. To make the output, compare the corresponding orange and gray cells (black equals black, color equals color). If they match, make the output grid cell black, else make it green.\\\\n39. To obtain the output, you need to compare the squares to the left and right of the green squares. If they match (both red or both orange or both grey), make the output square black. If they do not match, make the output square green. The three squares that make up the output in each row correspond to the three squares in the input grid to the left and right of the green square and the green square itself.\\\\n40. To transform the grid, you should compare each pair of squares that are on the same positions on the left and right side of the blue column. If the squares match (either both being color or both being black), convert them into a black square on the output grid. If they don\\\\\\'t match, covert them into a green square on the output grid. Ignore the blue squares. The output grid should have the same layout as either left or right side of original grid, just with different colors.\\\\n41. To make the output, you have to compare the corresponding squares on the left and right 2x3 blocks. If the squares match in color, make the output square black. If one side is colored (either orange or grey) and the other side is black, color the output square green. The blue line in the middle is ignored.\\\\n42. To obtain the output grid from the input, first divide the input into two halves, separated by the line of red blocks. Now, for each position in the 4x3 output grid, look at the corresponding positions in the two halves of the input. If the cells from both halves are the same (both have blocks or both are empty), color that cell in the output as black. But if the cells are different (one has a block and the other is empty), color that cell in the output as green.\\\\n43. To make the output, you need to look at which cells in the first and third columns of each side match. Where there is a grey cell in both the first and third column, replace that cell in the second column with a green cell in the output. If there isn\\\\\\'t a match, the cell in the output should be black. Black cells from input remain black in the output. Perform this for the columns on both sides and ignore the blue column in the middle in the input.\\\\n44. To make the output, you have to look at color pairing of each cell column-wise. If a cell on left side matches with the same cell on the right side (both are black or both are colored), make the output cell color black (0). If they do not match, make the output cell color green (3). Note that you\\\\\\'ll not consider the cells underlying the middle vertical line while creating the output grid.\\\\n45. To make the output, you have to examine the cells pair on both sides of the blue cells line by line. If there are matching cells on either side of the blue line, replace that row\\\\\\'s blue cell in the output with a green cell. If there are no matching cells, replace that row\\\\\\'s blue cell in the output with a black cell. Only the red cells from the input are transferred to the output.\\\\n46. To get the output from the input, slice the input grid by removing the 4th column (blue) and the last column. Then, the cell in the output grid will be green if there is at least one grey cell in its corresponding column from the input; otherwise, the cell remains black (empty).\\\\n47. To make the output, observe the cells on the left and right of the blue line. If a cell on the left side is grey, then the corresponding cell on the output will be black. If a cell on the right is grey, then the corresponding cell on the output will be green. If both cells on both sides are grey, the corresponding cell on the output will remain black. Empty spaces are ignored while transforming and only the grey cells are considered.\\\\n48. To create the output from the input, count the number of grey cells in both columns on either side of the central blue line. For each row, if the count of the grey squares matches in both columns, paint the corresponding square in the output grid as green. If the counts do not match, the corresponding output square remains black.\\\\n49. To make the output, you have to look at the corresponding positions on left and right side rectangles. If a spot in the left rectangle is colored but its corresponding spot on the right rectangle is blank, or vice versa, then color that spot in the output grid green. If both spots are blank or colored, then leave it blank in the output.  If the same transformation is applied to all spots correct output grid would be formed.\\\\n50. The transformation involves comparing squares in the left and right. If they match (both black or both color) make the output square black. If they do not match, make the output square green. The number of squares compared on the left side is 3 starting from the left and on the right side is 3 starting from the right. Ignore the vertical line of blue squares.\\\\n51. In the output grid, if the cells on the same position in the left and right zones of the input grid have the same color (non-blue and non-black), make the corresponding cell in the output grid green. If the cells have different colors or one/both cells are black, make the corresponding cell in the output grid black. Ignore the blue cells in the input grid, they do not appear in the output grid.\\\\n52. The output grid derives from comparing corresponding cells on the left and right sections in the input grid (for example, column 1 to column 5, column 2 to column 6, column 3 to column 7). If both cells being compared are orange (7), the corresponding cell on the output grid becomes black (0). If both cells being compared are black (0) or one is orange (7) and the other is gray (5), the corresponding cell on the output grid becomes black (0). If the cells being compared are different, with one being black and one being orange or both being gray (5), the corresponding cell in the output grid becomes green (3).\\\\n53. To make the output, you have to primarily focus on the gray and teal colors on either side of the blue strip in the input grid. Divide the grid in such a way that you find equal number of gray and teal cells in respective columns on  both sides of the blue strip. Corresponding to each such column, you draw a green cell for that column in the output grid.  If you find any uneven number of teal or gray cells corresponding to a column (let\\\\\\'s say left), then put an empty cell (black color) for the corresponding output column.  Perform such operations from top to bottom of the grid. In simple terms, the pattern involves matching numbers of colored cells on both sides. Being symmetrical gives a green square in the output, else leads to a black (empty) square.\\\\n54. To make the output, you should look at each section of input row separately. - For the first section, if it contains more 0 than 7, fill the corresponding section of the output grid with 3; else, fill with 0. - For the second section, there is no operation needed as it\\\\\\'s filled with 1\\\\\\'s only. - For the third section, if it contains more 0 than 5, fill the corresponding section of the output grid with 3; else, fill with 0.\\\\n55. To make the output, you have to compare the sections of orange and black cells on the left and right of the blue column. If both sections in the same row have the same number of orange cells, place a black cell in the corresponding location in the output, otherwise, place a green cell. The output grid should be the same height (number of rows) as the input grid, and each row of the output corresponds to a row of the input.\\\\n56. The transformation process is as follows: First, split the picture along the vertical black line and keep the halves superimposed on each other. Then keep the superimposition on center of the output grid, and the output grid converts the overlapping to grid entries as follows: If orange square overlaps with black in green square or vice versa, the grid entry is black (denoted by \\\\\\'0\\\\\\'). If orange and green squares overlap with each other, the grid entry is green (denoted by \\\\\\'3\\\\\\'). If black squares overlap, the grid entry remains black. This creates the output. In this way, the grid is compressed and the overlapping areas turned into one of two colors based on the rule.\\\\n57. To make the output, you have to divide the input grid in two halves by disregarding the blue column in the center. The remaining grid is a 3x4 grid. Then, compare the cells column by column in these two halves. If both cells of the column have the same color, the corresponding cell in the output grid will be black (value 0). If the cells are of different colors, the output cell will be green (value 3).\\\\n58. We only consider the first or second color count before blue and after blue. If the count is the same, the value in the output grid is 0 (black). If the count is not the same, the value in the output grid is 3 (green).\\\\n59. To transform the input to the output, compare the blocks in the left and right 3x4 regions. If a cell is brown on the left and grey on the right, or if it is black on either side, it should be black in the output. However, if there is a colour mismatch, (i.e., one side is black and the other side is coloured or one side is coloured and the other side is black), then make the corresponding cell in the output grid green.\\\\n60. To make the output, you have to compare the orange and grey squares in each column on either side of the blue line. If they match (both orange, both grey, or both black), make the output square black. If they do not match, make the output square green.\\\\n61. To make the output, you must convert the binary values represented by the colors in the input into decimal values. For the first and second columns of the output, change the orange and grey colors in the input to \\\\\\'1\\\\\\' and the black to \\\\\\'0\\\\\\'. For the third column of the output, convert the binary values represented by the 4th-6th columns in the input into decimal and map them to green cells in the output, leaving the rest as black cells.\\\\n62. Start with a 4x3 grid with all the cells being black, the color of black is 0. Then for the 3x3 grid on the right in the input strip, if there is a gray cell (number 5), repaint the corresponding cell in the output grid to green (number 3).\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "After analyzing the rules, they can be categorized into eight distinct categories based on their similarities:\n\nCategory 1: Rules that involve comparing the number of colored cells in two sections of the input grid.\nCategory 2: Rules that involve comparing the colors of corresponding cells in two sections of the input grid.\nCategory 3: Rules that involve comparing the positions of colored cells in two sections of the input grid.\nCategory 4: Rules that involve comparing the colors of cells in a single section of the input grid.\nCategory 5: Rules that involve comparing the colors of cells in a single row of the input grid.\nCategory 6: Rules that involve comparing the colors of cells in a single column of the input grid.\nCategory 7: Rules that involve comparing the colors of cells in a 2x2 or 3x3 square of the input grid.\nCategory 8: Rules that involve converting the colors of cells in the input grid to binary or decimal values.\n\nSynthesized rules for each category:\n\n1.

For each category, synthesize the rules into a single, specific rule that combines the ideas of all rules in that category, while clearly differentiating it from the other categories.\\\\nThe new rule should be as specific as possible, following the format of the given rules.\\\\nThe new rule should be applicable without any information from the original rules - i.e. it should be standalone.\\\\n\\\\nRules:\\\\n1. To transform the grid, first ignore the black lines, and then look at the pattern in each row. If the pattern is \"color, black, color, black, color, black, color\", then the output for that row is that color. If the pattern is \"color, black, color, black, different color\", then the output for that row is the different color. The output color should be represented by its corresponding number.\\\\n2. To make the output grid you have to identify the colored tiles within the squares that are surrounded by blue (1) tiles and record their color number into the output grid. Thus, the output grid will be of the form [[determined color], [determined color], ..., [determined color]]. For example, for every horizontal line, the sequence blue (1), next colour of your choice, blue (1), next colour of your choice, & blue (1) gives the output colour. Repeat this and stack them vertically in the output grid.\\\\n3. To make the output, you have to identify the color of the middle cell in each 3x3 square and put that color in the output grid. Start with the top 3x3 square and move downwards.\\\\n4. To make the output, go through the input grid, excluding the outermost row and column, and identify the colors of the 2x2 squares. In each case, skip the light blue square and account for the other three types. The output is formed by listing the three distinct non-light blue colors in the order they appear in the columns of the larger square, from left to right.\\\\n5. Check each row in the input grid which has numbers other than 0s. For each such row, pick the pair of numbers that are unequally distributed in the row (i.e., not uniformly placed on the left and right side of the central column). Put these numbers (ignoring the 1s) in the output grid from top to bottom in the order they are found. If there are no such numbers in a row, skip that row.\\\\n6. To make the output, you have to notice the color that appears in the body of each group but does not appear in the header of that group. The output is the sequence of these new colors from each group, in order.\\\\n7. To prepare the output grid, look at the input grid row by row, and when a new color appears that had not appeared in the upper rows perform the following operation: if a new color is found on the left (most left column), add a new data point to the output map, this point should be the color number present on the right of the new color (if it exists), otherwise, leave the cell empty. The data points in the output map should be positioned in the insertion order.\\\\n8. To make the output, you have to identify the second set of colored doubles between the black rows in each strip. The color of those blocks (ignoring the blue ones) gives you the value of the cell in the output grid.\\\\n9. The transformation involves identifying the unique colors that are present in the central 2x2 block in every color line and outputting each unique color as a separate single line in the output, maintaining the sequential order from top to bottom as observed in the input grid.\\\\n10. To make the output, you have to find the color that appears in a row which does not appear in the rows above it. It\\\\\\'s the new color in each subsequent row starting from top. The output should consist of these new colors in the order they appear from the top row to bottom row. Transform these colors into numbers.\\\\n11. To make the output, you have to identify colors of the rightmost boxes from top to bottom and ignore all black strips. The output shall consist of the colors that are not duplicated from top to bottom. The top unique color makes the top row of the output, the second is for the second row and third distinctive color is for third row. If there are more than three unique colors, ignore those after the third.\\\\n12. To make the output, you need to look at each non-black (color 1) grid square and compare it to its central 3x3 square. Assign the color of the 1x1 square that doesn\\\\\\'t match the center square color to the corresponding index in the output 3x1 grid. The order is from top to bottom.\\\\n13. To transform the grid, note that the stripes of blue boxes form rectangles surrounding the different colored stripes in the middle column. The result consists of the different colored stripes surrounded by the blue boxes in the middle column, starting from the top and moving to the bottom. In each stripe, the different colored box that appears between the two blue boxes determines the color of the cell in the output grid corresponding to the row.\\\\n14. To make the output, you have to find the color of the mid-section in each of the first three lines of color that is not black or blue. The result will have one row for each color.\\\\n15. To make the output, you have to look for the unique colors in the middle two cell pairs between each black border. The unique colors are determined by their occurrence between the black bars - each color in the middle two cell pairs should appear only once in all rows. These colors will be compiled and presented in the output in the order of their appearance from top to bottom, enclosed in a black square.\\\\n16. To create the output, you need to read the grid line by line, ignore the blue cell or \"1\". For each row of the input grid, the non-blue color (or number different than \"1\") that appears first gets recorded one time, no matter how many times it appears in that row. You output these recorded numbers/color each in a new line in the output grid.\\\\n17. To get the output, you first need to identify every third line starting from the second. Within these lines, find the set of adjacent colored cells that is surrounded by two other identical sets. The color of this middle set determines the color of the corresponding cell in the output. The first identified line corresponds to the top cell in the output, the second to the middle cell, and the third to the bottom cell.\\\\n18. To make the output, you have to  identify the different colors used in the 4x2 blocks in the middle of each line (except for the first color which is always repeated). Then, map these colors to the output in the sequence from top to bottom. Each color should be interpreted as a corresponding number and displayed in the output grid as a single number in each row. Repeat for each color found.\\\\n19. To transform, you need to check each patterned row of sub-sequences and identify the unique color that is not blue. Record these colors in sequence to form a vertical color column in the output. This means mapping the patterned row sub-sequence repetition counts to an output in which each unique color that is not blue appears once in succession based on the order they appear in the patterned row in the input. The first color in the output would be from the first patterned row in input and so on.\\\\n20. To make the output, you have to focus on each row containing colored squares. Within each row pick the color that is different from the repeating color. For example, if a row has repeated pairs of blue squares along with some pairs of yellow squares, pick the yellow as the output color for that row. Translate the chosen color into the corresponding digit and assign it to a square in the output column. The total number of squares in the output column should match the total number of colored rows from the input. In other words, each distinct colored row from the input should have a singly represented square in the output column.\\\\n21. The pattern change each time it repeats horizontally, starting with a colored square (different for each row), followed by another colored square different from the first one (also different in each row), and a last colored square repeating the first one. The process is to identify the color/number of the square in the second column in each horizontal row, and transcribe this number/color to a single column on the output grid. Each row from the input leads to a colored square in the output.\\\\n22. To make the output, you have to find the color of the second vertical line of each repeated three lines pattern in each row. Therefore, basically referring to each row (disregarding the border), it is following the pattern: \"Two vertical lines of one color-black-two vertical lines of another color-black-two vertical lines of the first color\". The result will then be a column of three cells; each containing the number corresponding to the color of the \"second vertical line of another color\" in the same row of the input.\\\\n23. To obtain the output from the input, you have to identify the pattern color that appears in the input as the third group. This color should then be entered as the corresponding row in the single-column output grid. The process should be done for each colored pattern row, in the sequence top-down.\\\\n24. To make the output, you have to identify the unique color in each pair sequence (that is not blue), and transcribe that color into the corresponding row in the output column. If the pair sequence only has blue color, transcribe it as black in the output. The order should match the sequence of pairs in the input grid from top to bottom. Note that only pairs (not single colors) are recognised.\\\\n25. For each row separated by black in the input grid, take note of the one pair of colored squares that is not like the others in that row - that is, it is a different color from the rest of the pairs. The transformation extracts these unique non-matching colored items, and have them represented as separate cells in the output grid, in the order they appeared in the input from top to bottom. If more than one different color pair appears in one row, choose the last appearing pair.\\\\n26. To make the output, you have to count the number of squares of a non-blue color in each section. In the output grid the number is encoded by a color: 1:Blue, 2:Red, 3:Green, 4:Yellow, 5:Grey, 6:Fuchsia, 7:Orange, 8:Teal, 9:Brown. Count the squares color in each section and fill the grid with the color that represent the counted number. The column of the output grid should be in the same order as the sections from top to bottom in the input.\\\\n27. To make the output, count the distinct colored segments in the input grid and list them in the order they appear from top to bottom. Then create an output grid with a single column where each cell corresponds to the specific color numbers found in the input. Each color in a specific order should be represented by its own number in the output grid. The output does not include black cells.\\\\n28. To make the output, you need to identify the color of the stripe pair that mismatches the color of the stripes in the first stripe pair at the top of the input grid. Write down these mismatch colors in order of appearance from top to bottom in the grid to form the output column.\\\\n29. To obtain the output, one needs to take the color of the squares that are vertically in the middle point of the squares grouped between black lines in the input. This picked color is then displayed vertically in the output grid in the same order from top to bottom.\\\\n30. To make the output, you have to consider the second color block in each stripe. The color number in this block is different for each stripe. Starting from the top, take the number of the special color in the first, third, and fifth stripe and put them into the output from top to bottom.\\\\n31. In order to transform the grid from the input to the output, you should identify the unique colors (excluding blue) appearing in the inner segments of input grid. Assign a grey block for each unique color found in the input grid. These grey blocks should be ordered in the output grid in the order they were first encountered in the input grid.\\\\n32. To make the output, you have to look at the colored pairs that changed every three rows. The unique color added, not repeated in the previous sequence, is added as a new row in the output. This is repeated throughout the vertical length of the input grid. The output is a column of the unique colors introduced at each level.\\\\n33. To make the output, you have to extract the central number pairs from each number set starting from top to bottom and place them in the output grid sequentially downwards.\\\\n34. To make the output, you have to determine the colour that replaced blue in each line and create a single colour block line for each. Stack these lines in the order they appear on the input grid to form the output.\\\\n35. To make the output, you need to focus on the two pairs of squares at either end of each band. The output for each band is the color of the bit pair which differs from the other three pairs in that row. For example, in the first row of the first case, the pairs are coded in blue, green, blue, blue. The pair coded in green stands out and so we code the output for this band as green. This process is completed for each band in the input to produce the output.\\\\n36. To make the output, you have to count the accent colors appearing in pairs in each colored row. Eliminate the pair that repeats the most (which is usually the base color of the row) and take the remaining three unique colors in the order they appeared from top to bottom. If a row has a repeated accent color among pairs, ignore the duplicates. For instance, consider only three different unique pairs from the colored rows.\\\\n37. To make the output, you take the color of the boxes that appear after every third black box in each row of pairs of colored boxes. Ignore the rows of black boxes. The output is a column of single colored boxes that correspond to the colors taken from the input.\\\\n38. To make the output, you have to look for the number other than 1 (blue) in each colored row of the original grid and write them down in order. Ignore the all-black rows and the first colored row in the original grid.\\\\n39. To make the output, you have to identify the unique color in each pattern row of the input grid (the color which appears only once in that particular row but not in any other row) and place those unique colored squares in same sequence in the output grid. If a pattern row doesn\\\\\\'t have a unique color, ignore that row in the output. The color in the output is represented by the number denoting that color.\\\\n40. To make the output, you have to find the distinct colored squares in each alternate row starting from the second row in the input grid (ignoring black and duplicate squares in a row). Then note the color square which is at the 7th position from left (or 7th column from first column) in that row. Map this color square number to the corresponding output. Continue this process for each alternative row. For instance in Case 0: in 2nd input row blue (1) is the distinct color at 7th position, in 5th row red (4) is the distinct color at 7th position and in 8th row green (2) is the distinct color at 7th position. These become our output points.\\\\n41. To make the output, you have to pick out the color from the central square in every row (ignoring the first and last rows which are always completely black). Each color should be output in a new row in the same order from top to bottom as they appeared in the input i.e. the color of the central square in the second row of the input grid forms the color of the first cell in the output grid, the color of the central square in the third row of the input grid forms the color of the second cell in the output grid and so on.\\\\n42. Each row in the output corresponds to the color of the third block in the row from the input. The color from the input transform to a number based on the color\\\\\\'s numerical representation.\\\\n43. To make the output, you have to count the amount of sections where the rectangles\\\\\\' colors are not the same as the first section in the grid, and note the color of the rectangle that is different. For the first position in the output, count the amount of sections where the rectangles\\\\\\' colors are not the same as the first section and are found in the 3rd position of each section. For the second position in the output, count the amount of sections where the rectangles\\\\\\' colors is not the same as the first section and are found in the 5th position of each section. For the third position in the output, count the amount of sections where the rectangles\\\\\\' colors are not the same as the first section and are found in the 7th position of each section. The number (color) that has the highest number of occurrences will be placed in the respective position in the output. If there is a tie, choose the one that appears first in reading order.\\\\n44. To make the output, you have to go through every row with colored squares, start from the second column square until the 10-th column square (both inclusive). Your task is to identify the unique color in each of those rows that doesn\\\\\\'t occur in the adjacent pairs of the first and the last column. Then arrange those identified colors in the order of the rows from top to bottom and place each of those in separate rows in the output with corresponding numbers representing those colors.\\\\n45. To make the output, you have to count the number of unique colors in each row (ignoring black). Then, write those colors down in the same order as they are presented in rows from top to bottom. The result should be a list of colors (as numbers) in the output grid.\\\\n46. To identify how to find the values in the output grid, find the unique paired colored squares in each section. The unique paired colored squares will not be on the outer sections of the segment they belong to. They will also not be the same color as the outer paired squares of a segment. The output grid comprises these unique paired colored squares in the order they appeared.\\\\n47. To make the output, you have to look at the colored rows above and below the yellow(4) row, where each color represents a number. Look at the middle color of the 3 color-coded columns. Assign the top color from the corresponding three blocks above the yellow row to the first output digit. Assign the bottom color from the corresponding three blocks below the yellow row to the last output digit. Assign the left color from the corresponding three blocks in the same row as yellow to the second output digit. Ignore the black rows and cells for this transformation.\\\\n48. To make the output, you have to compare each pair of colored patterns above and below a line from top to bottom. The first unique color pattern in each pair is the output. The order of the output values corresponds to the order of the occurrence of the first unique colored pattern in each pair from top to bottom in the input.\\\\n49. To make the output, you have to consider the second cell of the first two colored cells and the first cell of the last two coloured cells in each row. The colors of these cells will form the number in the consecutive rows of the output. Count the number instead of the color for the output.\\\\n50. The output is generated by following these rules, first, look vertically for the colored stripes that are surrounded by black from the top and bottom. The output will be the colors in the middle three stripes in each \"group\" (i.e., the second, fourth and sixth stripes). It will result in a vertical line. Note that we don\\\\\\'t consider the first and the last stripe in each group. Transform each color in that vertical line to a numerical representation: blue = 1, red = 2, green = 3, yellow = 4, cyan = 8. Then, create a grid from these numbers, so each number is in a separate cell.\\\\n51. To make the output, count the colors in the stripes except for black. If a color appears repeatedly in the same stripe it should not be counted twice. The output should list the unique colors of each stripe from top to bottom. If a stripe only contains a single color, this color must be listed. If a stripe includes multiple colors, only the color that appears in the middle (fourth column from left or right) is to be counted. The rows of the output grid should correspond to the stripes of the input grid from top to bottom.\\\\n52. To make the output, you have to identify which colors are out of sequential position in the paired sequences in each row and output them in the order they appear. A color is out of sequential position if it does not appear in the same spot in the next set. Both instances of a specific color (i.e., pair) are considered as equal. If a color appears out of sequence multiple times, count it once for each row it appears in. The order should be maintained in the output.\\\\n53. To make the output, you have to look at every second 1-row high pattern (excluding the first and last rows which are always blue and red respectively). Compare this row with the blue row on top. For every instance in the row where the color differs from the blue row, record the differing color in the output column. Each visual row corresponds to a single cell in the output grid.\\\\n54. To make the output, you have to classify these colored squares by unique colors other than the ones at the far left in each line and transfer the color to their corresponding numbers, each row of the output corresponds to each row of the colored rectangles.\\\\n55. Take each row that contains colored squares other than blue, find the color that isn\\\\\\'t blue, and place an output row containing the color number that corresponds to the uncommon color. The ordering of the rows in the output should correspond to the ordering of the rows in the input.\\\\n56. To make the output, you have to find the color that appears the least frequently in each band of the input grid and put it in the output grid, noting that each color is represented by a unique number. The output grid should ignore black blocks. The order of colors in the output should follow the order of bands in the input.\\\\n57. To make the output, count the number of unique colors that appear in the 8th and 10th column of even-numbered rows in the input. Assign this count to the first row on output. Do the same for the 12th column of the input and assign it to the third row of the output. For the second row of the output, count the number of times the colored blocks in the 2nd, 4th, 6th column of the input appear in the entire grid, assign this count to the second row of the output.\\\\n58. Starting from the second row in the input grid, to get the output, identify the color represented in the column in the input row that is different from the other columns. If the color in this column is the same as the color in the second column, ignore this row and move to the next row. Record the color in an output column in the order the rows appear, starting from the top down. This will result in a single vertical column in the output grid where each cell has a color corresponding to a unique colored square within each colored row of the input. Special cases to consider: If there are rows with all the same color in the colored positions, skip this row and move to the next row. If all the colors in the colored positions of a row are the same, disregard this row in producing the output. Do not record the first and last color in the grid, which are always black.\\\\n59. To make the output, you have to go through the order of the mirrored structures and identify the new colour that appears in each symmetric pattern, following from top to bottom. Write the colour numbers in each row of a new grid column. If there\\\\\\'s no new colour, leave the position empty.\\\\n60. To make the output, you identify all the unique colors appearing in only the third section (from the left) of the input grid in their order of appearance, replace these colors with the colors appearing only in the second section (from the left) in the grid, and put them into consecutive rows in the output grid. Do not fill the remaining cells of the output grid.\\\\n61. To make the output, you have to scan the colored rows from top to bottom, left to right ignoring the black spaces. The output of each colored row is the color number of the rectangle that does not repeat in the same row.\\\\n62. To make the output, you have to count the unique colors in each strip, excluding black. Then, find the color that is used only once in each strip and put it in the corresponding position in the output. The colors are represented by their corresponding numbers. If no unique color exists in a strip, leave it black (0).\\\\n63. 1. Start examination from the 3rd row in the grid: Take note of the color that fills the central square for each 1x2 square (situated in the middle of the grid) each for the 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th and 11th lines. 2. For each diverse color filling the central square, make it a different row in the output sequence. The order of the colors appears in the input from top to bottom (ignoring repeated colors) is the order for the output from top to bottom.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "After analyzing the rules, they can be categorized into eight distinct categories based on their similarities:\n\nCategory 1: Rules that involve identifying unique colors or patterns in each row or column.\nCategory 2: Rules that involve counting or identifying specific colors in certain positions or sequences.\nCategory 3: Rules that involve identifying colors that do not appear in certain positions or sequences.\nCategory 4: Rules that involve identifying colors that appear in a specific order or sequence.\nCategory 5: Rules that involve identifying colors that are surrounded or enclosed by other colors.\nCategory 6: Rules that involve identifying colors that appear in the middle of a sequence or pattern.\nCategory 7: Rules that involve identifying colors that appear in specific sections or groups.\nCategory 8: Rules that involve identifying colors that are different from a certain color or pattern.\n\nSynthesized Rules:\n\nCategory 1: Identify the unique color or pattern in each row or column of the input grid.

For each category, synthesize the rules into a single, specific rule that combines the ideas of all rules in that category, while clearly differentiating it from the other categories.\\\\nThe new rule should be as specific as possible, following the format of the given rules.\\\\nThe new rule should be applicable without any information from the original rules - i.e. it should be standalone.\\\\n\\\\nRules:\\\\n1. To make the output, you have to diagonally mimic the pattern in the input grid across the output grid where black boxes in the input grid are represented as zeroes(0) in the output, and numbers from the input grid take their respective position in the output grid diagonally moving along from top right to bottom left.\\\\n2. To make the output, you need to position the colored squares in the input diagonally on the output grid. Start from the bottom left and move towards the upper right. All other squares should be colored black.\\\\n3. The output grid is formed by placing the non-zero numbers from the input line along the main diagonal of the grid, from top-left to bottom-right. The rest of the cells in the grid are filled with zeros. The numbers from the input line maintain their original order along the diagonal in the output grid.\\\\n4. To make the output, first count the number of colored cells in the input, overall giving you a count of N. The output grid will become a N * N square grid. The colored pixels in the input are mapped to an anti-diagonal line in the output from bottom-left to top-right, with the same color sequence from left to right in the input. Each colored pixel is placed on its own column with black cells padding the spaces, keeping the color progression from bottom to top. Black cells in the input are ignored.\\\\n5. To transform the input into the output, create a diagonal line from the top right to the bottom left of the output grid. The line should start with the first number of the input, continue with the second number, and so forth. The rest of the output grid should remain black. The non-zero numbers from the input should map directly to the corresponding colors in the output.\\\\n6. To transform the input to the output, start by measuring the amount of colored boxes on the input row. Multiply that number by three to get the size of the output grid. Then, in the output, create the same diagonal pattern observed in the examples using the same colors as in the input, starting from the bottom left corner and going up to the top right. Each colored box occupies a diagonal line in output grid. The black boxes in input doesn\\\\\\'t make any changes in output.\\\\n7. To form the output grid, remove black cells in the input. Then for each color in the input sequence, create a diagonal line in the output grid starting from a cell of that color in the input and extending down towards the right until it reaches the bottom of the output grid. The diagonal lines contain cells of the same color as the original color from the input sequence, and the remaining cells are black.\\\\n8. To make the output, from the input row, transform each element, preserving its value, into a diagonal from lower left to upper right, starting at the bottom for the first non-zero leftmost element and shifting upwards for subsequent elements. It\u2019s like having a mirror along the upward diagonal of the square. All other cells in the grid that are not part of these diagonals should be black.\\\\n9. To make the output grid, Start from the bottom-left corner of the square, and plot a diagonal line upwards to the right. Draw each cell of this line according to the colors in the input row. Then, rotate around the midpoint of the row in the original order as you do that, the color of the point changes to the next color in the original line. If you reach the end of the colors, start again from the beginning. Empty cells remain empty.\\\\n10. To make the output, starting from the bottom left, the color above the previous is filled in the output square if the current input square is not black. This pattern should progress diagonally up to the right and fill any black spaces with black. This process should continue for each input color until the output grid is complete.\\\\n11. To make the output, you have to draw a diagonal line from the right-uppermost cell to the left-bottommost cell using the sequence of colors from the input row, with all other cells being black. The diagonal starts with the leftmost color of the input and ends with the rightmost color of the input.\\\\n12. 1. Count the non-black cells in the input grid (let\\\\\\'s call it \\\\\\'count\\\\\\') and create a square \\\\\\'Output\\\\\\' grid of size (2*count - 1). 2. Start from the top left corner of the \\\\\\'Output\\\\\\' grid and move in a diagonal manner (like the path followed by the bishop piece in chess) until you reach the middle of the square grid. 3. After you hit the middle of the grid, continue the diagonal path until the bottom right of the grid. Fill the cell with the next color only if you encounter a black cell. 4. If the current grid cell color in the input has a color, place that color in the current cell of the \\\\\\'Output\\\\\\' grid and the rest cells in the diagonal path. 5. All the remaining cells in your \\\\\\'Output\\\\\\' grid should be black.  If you follow these instructions correctly, the output will be a color diagonal in a black square. The colors in the diagonal run\\\\n13. To make the output, you start by placing the input row on the diagonal of the output grid, from right to left, top to bottom. The input row must be duplicated (repeated) as many times as needed, from top to bottom, until all rows are filled. If the input row has a black box, put a black box in the corresponding position in the output grid. If the input box is coloured, put the corresponding coloured box in the output grid.\\\\n14. The transformation involves taking each non-black colored box in the sequence and placing it diagonally in the output grid from bottom left to top right. This process should be repeated for each non-black box in the sequence, and the placement of the boxes in the output grid should start at the bottom left corner and move diagonally to the top right. Black boxes from the sequence do not add to the size of the output grid or appear in the output.\\\\n15. To make the output, you have to create a diagonal line on the grid starting from the bottom-left and moving to the top-right. Each cell on this diagonal line should be colored in the same order as the non-black cells from input grid appear from left to right. All other cells should be black.\\\\n16. First, find the number of non-black cells in the input row. Multiply this number by three to get the size of the output square grid. Now, imagine an imaginary diagonal line stretching from the top left corner to the bottom right corner of the output grid and place the non-black cells from the input along this line, keeping their original order and spacing the same, but with the bottom cell in the column on the left and the top cell in the column on the right, if there are more than 1 non-black cell. The rest of the grid should be just black cells.\\\\n17. The output grid is three times larger than the input in each dimension, meant to be thought of as a diagonal repetition of the input. If there is a colored box in the input, replicate it by moving to the right and downwards in the output. Fill every empty space with black.\\\\n18. Take the non-black cells from the input (in their input order) and lay them out diagonally from the top right to the bottom left of the output grid. All other cells in the output grid should be black. The color of the diagonal cells should be the same as in the input.\\\\n19. To make the output, lay out each colored dot diagonally from the top right to the bottom left of the expanded square. Ensure that you maintain the order of the colors from the input. Fill any remaining cells in the grid in the output with black.\\\\n20. To make the output, start from the bottom of the grid and read the input from left to right. For each input cell, fill a diagonal stripe in the output from lower left to upper right. The width of the stripe is based on the count of non-black cells in the input. The number in the stripe is the same as the current input cell. Skip black cells in the input. Continue this process for each non-black cell in the input.\\\\n21. To make the output, the transformation depends on the number of unique colors (including black) present: If there are two unique colors, mirror the colors sequence, excluding black, on the main diagonal of square grid until the last color of the sequence meets the bottom left corner. If there are three unique colors, mirror the color sequence, including black, on the main diagonal of square grid until the last color of the sequence meets the bottom left corner. Please note that the size of the square grid for the output is twice the number of cells of the color sequence (which may include black, based on aforementioned rules) -1.\\\\n22. To make the output grid, arrange the colored cells in a diagonal line running from the bottom left to top right if read from left to right. Let the rest of the cells remain black. Each row of the output should contain only one colored cell, at the position corresponding to the colored cell from the input.\\\\n23. To make the output, you have to create a diagonal line, starting from the bottom left corner to the upper right corner, following the sequence of the non black color boxes from left to right found on top of the black line in the input. Place each color box on this diagonal line, repeating the color box twice horizontally except for the first and last. Fill the rest of the grid with black boxes.\\\\n24. To make the output, you have to create a diagonal line of each color that goes from right to left. The blank spaces are filled with 0s (black). Each colour block should appear as many times as the number of nonzero blocks in the input. For instance, if you\\\\\\'ve got 4 colors other than black (0) in the input line, your output matrix should be 4*4; three diagonal entries in the matrix should display the colors in the order from the input line, but in the opposite direction (right to left). The first nonzero color in the input line appears once, the second color appears twice, and so forth.\\\\n25. Produce the output by sliding the non-black cells from the input grid along a diagonal line starting from the bottom-left to the top-right of the output grid. Each color should keep its place relative to the other colors (first color to appear in the input remains the first when reading the color cells along the diagonal in the output).\\\\n26. The transformation pattern is to \"transpose\" the previous line and add the next input value in the last place. Start the output transformation from the last column of the input, placing the value of this column at the last place of every row and shifting all previous ones to the left. The number of rows and columns in the output are the same as the total number of cells in the input.\\\\n27. To make the output, first count the number of colored cells in the input. This number gives the size of the output grid. In the output, arrange all the colored cells from the input in a descending diagonal line from top-right to bottom-left, and fill the remaining cells with black. Put the first colored cell at the top right corner, then move one cell down and left place the next, and so on.\\\\n28. To make the output, you have to create a diagonal line of numbers from the bottom left to the top right, using the non-zero numbers from the input in their original order. The length of this diagonal is equal to the number of non-zero numbers in the input. The rest of the grid is filled with zeros.\\\\n29. To make the output, you need to take the non-black numbers and place them on the leading diagonal of a 2D grid starting from the bottom-left corner to the top-right corner. The rest of the grid cells are black. Grid expands in width and height by repeating the last two cells of the row respectively while keeping the non-black numbers on the diagonal.\\\\n30. To make the output, you have to create a diagonal line of cells from the top-right of the grid to the bottom-left where the color of each cell in the line is determined by the corresponding number in the input sequence. If the corresponding number is 0 (black), the cell should be black. If a cell is not part of the diagonal line, it should be black.\\\\n31. To form the output, first, create a square grid with the mentioned dimensions. From the lower-left corner, diagonally ascend to the upper-right corner filling each diagonal line with the corresponding cell color from the input from left to right respectively. Leave black cells empty, and cells that do not fall within a diagonal line from the input should also remain black.\\\\n32. To get the output grid, you should draw a diagonal line from bottom left to top right using the colored cells in the input grid, following their order from left to right. Fill the rest of the squares with black color (0). The spaces between each colored cell on the diagonal is the same as the number of black cells between each colored cell in the input grid, starting from the number after the colored cell in the input grid.\\\\n33. To prepare the output, neglect all black cells from the input (left to right) and count the number of remaining colored cells. Then make a square grid of size equivalent to the total number cells in input and place the counted colored cells right diagonally from lower left to upper right in the same sequence as appeared in the input from left to right. Leave all remaining cells in the output as black.\\\\n34. To make the output grid, you have to read the row from left to right and place every element from the row into the column of the output grid. This starts from the last column of the grid and proceeds to the first, placing the elements along the main diagonal from bottom left to top right. All the remaining cells are filled with 0 (black).\\\\n35. To make the output, you have to arrange the input grid diagonally from bottom-left to top-right and expand right and downwards with each step, filling the remaining space with black. Treat black blocks as spaces and move to the next block in the input. Repeat this in the diagonal until all blocks from the input have been placed.\\\\n36. The transformation involves mapping the input row onto the main diagonal of the output grid. The main diagonal runs from the upper left corner of the grid to the lower right corner. The order of the colors is preserved but the grid is \"expanded\" in such a way that the color and black cells of the input now fall on the positions of the main diagonal of the output grid, and the rest of the cells in the output grid are black.\\\\n37. To make the output, you have to take each colored unit from the input and copy it so it forms a diagonal line from bottom left to top right in the output grid. The first colored unit in the input becomes the topmost diagonal line in the output grid, the next colored unit forms the line below and so on. If there are any black cells between colored units in the input, place corresponding amount of black cells between the colored cells\\\\\\' diagonal lines in the output.\\\\n38. To create the output grid, identify the colored cells in the input, excluding black. Create a square grid for each color where the length of the sides of the square equals the total number of colored cells in the input. Place respective color in a diagonal manner starting from bottom left to top right , and fill the rest of the cells with black. The order of the squares should be preserved as in the input. The final output is a matrix obtained by pasting these square grids in a row to column fashion.\\\\n39. To make the output, create a diagonal from top-right to bottom-left using the non-black squares from the input in their respective order. Fill all other squares with black.\\\\n40. From the input row, you would make a diagonal line from the top right to the bottom left. Any colored cell in the input would become a colored cell in the output positioned on this diagonal. Finally, each instance of colored cell is shifted one cell to the right on each successive row in the output.\\\\n41. To make the output, take the non-black cells and arrange them diagonally from the bottom left to the top right of the output grid, keeping the order from the input, and fill all remaining cells black. The number of cells in the output grid depends on the number of non-black cells in the input.\\\\n42. To make the output, you have to count the number of non-zero cells in the input which is equal to m and form a m x m grid where the mth row and mth column are same as corresponding color segment in the input grid such that the color of the mth row and color of the mth column intersects at the center of the grid.\\\\n43. To make the output, you have to place the corresponding colored cells of the input grid in a diagonal line from bottom-left to top-right in the output grid. The order of the colored cells in the input is kept in the output and the rest of the cells in the output grid are colored black.\\\\n44. To make the output, you have to create a multi-dimensional mirror image. Start from the first colored box of the input. Copy that color to the lower right-most corner of the output. Then repeat this action for the second color in the second last box of the bottom row and so on, creating an upward diagonal pattern of colors. All other boxes should be black.\\\\n45. To transform the grid from input to output, start by counting the number of colored cells in the input. Ignore the black colored cells (0). The resulting grid size should be a square of the resulting count size.  In the transformed output grid, the colored cells from the input should be diagonally arranged from left to right, replacing the first cell with the first colored digit, the second diagonal cell with the second colored digit and so forth, until all cells have been replaced, leaving the rest of the cells in the output grid as black colored cells (0s).\\\\n46. Place the colored squares from the input grid along the left-to-right diagonal (from top left to bottom right) with the first color in the first row. Leave every other square black. The square from the nth colored cell in the input belongs to the nth row and nth column in the output. For example, if the input has a colored cell in the 5th position, it will be in the fifth row and fifth column in the output. All the cells to the left and below it are black.\\\\n47. To create the output grid, the non-zero elements are transferred from the input array to the anti-diagonal of the output grid. The new grid is then filled with 0s from the bottom up, starting from the first row to last. This transformation results in a spiraling pattern from the outermost to innermost cells of the 2-Dimensional array.\\\\n48. To make the output, you need to diagonalize the non-black cells from the input, such that the colored cell occupies only one cell per row and column, starting from the bottom-left corner and moving diagonally to the top-right corner. The voids are filled with black cells. The colors maintain their original ordering from the input.\\\\n49. To generate the output grid, copy the pattern of the colors in the input row and paste it diagonally starting from the bottom left corner to the top right. All other cells in the grid that do not form part of this diagonal line should be left as blank cells (represented by the number 0). If there are multiple colored cells in the input row, the color sequence should be repeated in the order that they appeared in the input until the diagonal from the bottom left to the top right has been completely filled.\\\\n50. To transform the input into the output, first, ignore any black spaces in the input. Count the remaining colors starting from the left. Create a square output grid of size 5xNumber of colors. Place the colors in the input diagonally from the bottom left to the top right, maintaining their order. Only place the color once per a set of 5 rows, leaving the rest black. The non-black colors in the output should form a diagonal line going from bottom left to top right. Each color used only appears 5 times, once per row, and does not appear again within that row. The process then repeats for the next set of 5 rows, if applicable.\\\\n51. To make the output, you have to place the colored cells in a diagonal line from the bottom left corner to the top right corner in the order they appeared in the input row. The remaining spaces are filled with black cells.\\\\n52. To make the output, start from the bottom right corner of the grid and count the number of steps you take towards the top left of the grid diagonally along a straight line. The count resets for each non-black space in the input row. If the count equals the value that the non-black space is representing, you fill that space in the output grid with that color. You continue like this until you reach the top left corner.\\\\n53. To make the output, you have to expand the input grid in the form of colored cells. Start at bottom left to top right and copy the colored cell from the input line into the output grid diagonal starting at the bottom left corner to top right. Leave all other cells black.\\\\n54. To make the output, start from the rightmost colored cell in the input, create a diagonal line of this color in the output grid so that it starts from the bottom right corner and ends at the top left one. Then move one cell to the left in the input, and the next diagonal should start from the cell right to the end cell of the previous diagonal line. Repeat the process until all colored cells in the input have their corresponding diagonal lines in the output. Black cells in the input should be ignored. The cells not belonging to any of the diagonal lines should be black in the output.\\\\n55. The pattern involves extension and rotation of the non-black input grid. It is extended by a factor of 2 times the number of colored squares to become a square grid and then rotates anti-clockwise by 45 degrees. The black boxes remain in place.\\\\n56. To transform the input grid to the output, first, identify the colored cells in the input grid. Then, in the output grid, fill in colored cells such that they form a diagonal line from bottom left to top right, with the colors following the order of appearane in the input grid. The rest of cells in the output grid should be black.\\\\n57. To make the output, you have to create a diagonal line that goes from the bottom left corner to the top right corner of the grid. The cells in this line should match the color of the respective cells from the input in reversed order. All other cells should be black.\\\\n58. To make the output, you have to create a diagonal line from bottom-left to the top-right corner, following the color sequence in the input from left to right, with all the remaining squares being black.\\\\n59. To transform the input to the output, move the colored squares on the input to form a line along the major diagonal of the output matrix from the bottom-left corner to the top-right corner. Leave all other squares black.\\\\n60. To make the output, you have to start from the top right corner of the grid and fill the grid diagonally, shifting one cell to the left in each row. Leave the black cells in the input as black in the output and fill cells with the corresponding color from the input in the sequence they appear from left to right.\\\\n61. To make the output, copy the colored cells from the input to a matrix where the number of rows and columns is equal to the number of colored cells in the input. The direction of copying should be from top left to bottom right along the matrix diagonal. The cells of the matrix that are not on the main diagonal should be black.\\\\n62. To make the output grid, it\\\\\\'s necessary to diagonalize the input grid but in a mirrored version on a 2D grid. The bottom-leftmost colored cell in the input grid should be in the top-right of the output grid. The next colored cell will be in the next cell to the bottom-left and so on. All other cells should be filled with black cells.\\\\n\\'}]', 'gpt4-0613', \"{'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1000}\")": "Category 1: Diagonal from Top Right to Bottom Left\n1.
