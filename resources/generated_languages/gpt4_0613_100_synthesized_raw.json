    "original_response": "Category 1: Rules involving 3x3 squares\n1. To create the output, find the 3x3 squares of blue cells in the input. For each square, turn the middle cell and the cells surrounding it except the black ones into red. The other colors should remain the same.\n2. To make the output, take a look at each 3x3 square formed from the cells of the input grid. If this 3x3 pattern appears like a blue \u201cdonut\u201d - a hollow square with a blue border and black in the center - replace the blue cells which form the \"donut\" with red. Leave the rest of the cells unchanged.\n9. To make the output, you have to transform the grid by swapping each occurrence of the pattern with a red pattern (2s). The blue pattern in this instance is a 3x3 square comprised of: the top and bottom lines entirely filled, the middle line with the center space empty. This pattern transforms into  the pattern: a vertical line in the center of the 3x3 square.\n49. To make the output, you have to replace the middle cell of each 3x3 blue squares with a red cell if there is nothing else in the middle column of the grid else leave it as blue. Replace the other blue cells in the 3x3 square with black. Keep the rest of the grid the same.\n52. Each 3x3 blue square area in the input is transformed to a 3x3 square in the output with the 3 squares filled with red color in the shape of an inverted \"T\" (2 squares vertically at the center and a square horizontally at the top middle). The remaining squares remain the same as in the input.\n60. To make the output, you need to first identify the 3x3 blue figure in the input grid and convert it to a red figure formed by central element in the output and other blue boxes will remain unchanged. The black boxes remain the same throughout.\n\nCategory 2: Rules involving blue cells surrounded by other blue cells\n3. To make the output, you have to identify the squares surrounded by blue squares. A square is considered surrounded only if it has blue squares directly above, below and on the sides. Diagonal doesn't count.  Then turn those specific squares into red squares. Leave everything else as it is from the original grid. Also keep in mind that the borders of the grid are considered a wall, i.e., squares at the borders would need a blue square as a neighbour where the border is, to be marked as surrounded.\n22. To make the output, you have to consider the locations of blue \"1\"s. If a blue \"1\" is surrounded on all sides (including diagonals) by at least five other blue \"1\"s, transform it into a red \"2\". All other cells remain the same.\n25. To obtain the output from the input, check each cell in the input grid and follow this rule: if a turquoise cell is surrounded by other turquoise cells in all four directions (right, left, up and down), color that cell red in the output. That is, a cell is colored red if it has neighbors at the right and left, and also at the top and bottom, which are turquoise in the input. All other cells remain the same color as in the input.\n50. To make the output, you have to follow this rule: If a blue cell in the input grid is surrounded (above, below, to the left, and to the right) by at least three blue cells, that cell has to be converted to red in the output grid. All other cells maintain their colors.\n53. To make the output, you have to change some of the blue colour figures into red. Specifically, you should change the middle blue figure in each row containing 3 consecutive blue figures. If there are no 3 consecutive blue boxes in a row, the grid remains the same.\n\nCategory 3: Rules involving blue cells forming specific shapes or patterns\n6. Every blue cell that forms \u201cE\u201d or \u201c3\u201d letter is changed to black. On the other hand, every black cell that forms \"E\" or \"3\" is changed to red while preserving the original black cells elsewhere. The grid parts do not forming letters (containing only black and blue cells) are left unchanged.\n7. To make the output, you have to detect the numbers. If a grid square is part of the number 4, change the color to red. Keep the rest of the grid the same.\n10. To transform the input grid to the output grid, you need to identify all blue cells that form the shape \"1\" and replace these blue cells with red. All the blue cells forming the shapes \"0\" and \"4\" should remain unchanged. The black cells should also remain unchanged.\n27. To",

The pattern extends backward from the original blue square and repeats itself every N+1 row, where N is the number of squares in each row of the grid.\n3.

For every new row above, move the blue cell to the next column on the right. If it reaches the last column, the blue cell should return to the first column at the left on the new row above.\n5.
