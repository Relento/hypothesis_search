    "To make the output, you have to diagonally mimic the pattern in the input grid across the output grid where black boxes in the input grid are represented as zeroes(0) in the output, and numbers from the input grid take their respective position in the output grid diagonally moving along from top right to bottom left.",
    "To make the output, you need to position the colored squares in the input diagonally on the output grid. Start from the bottom left and move towards the upper right. All other squares should be colored black.",
    "To make the output, first count the number of colored cells in the input, overall giving you a count of N. The output grid will become a N * N square grid. The colored pixels in the input are mapped to an anti-diagonal line in the output from bottom-left to top-right, with the same color sequence from left to right in the input. Each colored pixel is placed on its own column with black cells padding the spaces, keeping the color progression from bottom to top. Black cells in the input are ignored.",
    "To transform the input into the output, create a diagonal line from the top right to the bottom left of the output grid. The line should start with the first number of the input, continue with the second number, and so forth. The rest of the output grid should remain black. The non-zero numbers from the input should map directly to the corresponding colors in the output.",
    "To transform the input to the output, start by measuring the amount of colored boxes on the input row. Multiply that number by three to get the size of the output grid. Then, in the output, create the same diagonal pattern observed in the examples using the same colors as in the input, starting from the bottom left corner and going up to the top right. Each colored box occupies a diagonal line in output grid. The black boxes in input doesn't make any changes in output.",
    "To make the output, from the input row, transform each element, preserving its value, into a diagonal from lower left to upper right, starting at the bottom for the first non-zero leftmost element and shifting upwards for subsequent elements. It\u2019s like having a mirror along the upward diagonal of the square. All other cells in the grid that are not part of these diagonals should be black.",
    "To make the output, starting from the bottom left, the color above the previous is filled in the output square if the current input square is not black. This pattern should progress diagonally up to the right and fill any black spaces with black. This process should continue for each input color until the output grid is complete.",
    "To make the output, you have to draw a diagonal line from the right-uppermost cell to the left-bottommost cell using the sequence of colors from the input row, with all other cells being black. The diagonal starts with the leftmost color of the input and ends with the rightmost color of the input.",
    "The transformation involves taking each non-black colored box in the sequence and placing it diagonally in the output grid from bottom left to top right. This process should be repeated for each non-black box in the sequence, and the placement of the boxes in the output grid should start at the bottom left corner and move diagonally to the top right. Black boxes from the sequence do",
    "Take the non-black cells from the input (in their input order) and lay them out diagonally from the top right to the bottom left of the output grid. All other cells in the output grid should be black. The color of the diagonal cells should be the same as in the input.",
    "To make the output, lay out each colored dot diagonally from the top right to the bottom left of the expanded square. Ensure that you maintain the order of the colors from the input. Fill any remaining cells in the grid in the output with black.",
    "To make the output, you have to create a diagonal line of cells from the top-right of the grid to the bottom-left where the color of each cell in the line is determined by the corresponding number in the input sequence. If the corresponding number is 0 (black), the cell should be black. If a cell is not part of the diagonal line, it should be black.",
    "To make the output, create a diagonal from top-right to bottom-left using the non-black squares from the input in their respective order. Fill all other squares with black.",
    "From the input row, you would make a diagonal line from the top right to the bottom left. Any colored cell in the input would become a colored cell in the output positioned on this diagonal. Finally, each instance of colored cell is shifted one cell to the right on each successive row in the output."
